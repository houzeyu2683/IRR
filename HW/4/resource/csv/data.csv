https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8896656/,Retinol-binding protein and transferrin in urine. New markers of renal function in essential hypertension and white coat hypertension?,"We studied the 24 h urinary excretion of albumin, transferrin, immunoglobulin G, and retinol-binding protein in individuals with essential hypertension, white coat hypertension, and normotension. In 56 individuals, we measured the 24 h ambulatory blood pressure (AMBP). The individuals could be divided into three groups: 26 hypertensives, 14 white coat hypertensives, and 16 normotensives. Daytime AMBP values were (median values with range in parentheses, mm Hg): hypertensives 158/105 (198 to 121/95 to 120), white coat hypertensives 141/83 (161 to 129/72 to 90), and normotensives 123/75 (148 to 102/63 to 86). We determined with immunochemical methods the 24 h urinary excretions of albumin, transferrin, and immunoglobulin G, all markers of glomerular dysfunction, and retinol-binding protein, a marker of impaired proximal tubular function. We found a significantly higher excretion of albumin and transferrin in hypertensives (P < .0000/P < .0001) and in white coat hypertensives (P < .003/P < .02) compared to normotensives. Out of 26 hypertensives, seven had microalbuminuria (> or = 30 to < 300 mg albumin/ 24 h). Two cases of microalbuminuria were found among the 14 white coat hypertensives. Immunoglobulin G excretion was not significantly increased in any of the hypertensive groups. Retinol-binding protein excretion was significantly higher in hypertensive patients (P < .007), whereas no elevation was observed in persons with white coat hypertension. In hypertensives, a significant correlation was found between urinary excretion of albumin and transferrin and office blood pressure and systolic AMBP. There was no significant correlation between the urinary excretions of IgG and retinol-binding protein and blood pressures in any of the three groups. Our findings indicate that patients with white coat hypertension, like hypertensives, have a selective type of glomerular dysfunction. However, proximal tubular dysfunction was seen only in hypertensives. Urinary excretions of albumin, transferrin, and retinol-binding protein may be useful as markers of glomerular and tubular dysfunction in essential hypertension.",,L E Bang;J Holm;T L Svendsen,hypertension

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33575241/,Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 Detection With Nasopharyngeal Swabs,"Background: SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects have been proven contagious in the symptomatic, pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic phase. The identification of these patients is crucial in order to prevent virus circulation. No reliable data on the sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are available because of the lack of a shared reference standard to identify SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The aim of our study was to collect data on patients with a known diagnosis of COVID-19 who underwent serial testing to assess NPS sensitivity. Methods: The study was a multi-center, observational, retrospective clinical study with consecutive enrollment. We enrolled patients who met all of the following inclusion criteria: clinical recovery, documented SARS-CoV-2 infection (≥1 positive rRT-PCR result) and ≥1 positive NPS among the first two follow-up swabs. A positive NPS not preceded by a negative nasopharyngeal swab collected 24-48 h earlier was considered a true positive. A negative NPS followed by a positive NPS collected 24-48 h later was regarded as a false negative. The primary outcome was to define sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection with NPS. Results: Three hundred and ninety three NPS were evaluated in 233 patients; the sensitivity was 77% (95% CI, 73 to 81%). Sensitivity of the first follow-up NPS (n = 233) was 79% (95% CI, 73 to 84%) with no significant variations over time. We found no statistically significant differences in the sensitivity of the first follow-up NPS according to time since symptom onset, age, sex, number of comorbidities, and onset symptoms. Conclusions: NPS utility in the diagnostic algorithm of COVID-19 should be reconsidered.",COVID-19; diagnosis; false negative (FN); sensitivity; swab analysis.,Bianca Clerici;Antonio Muscatello;Francesca Bai;Donatella Pavanello;Michela Orlandi;Giulia C Marchetti;Valeria Castelli;Giovanni Casazza;Giorgio Costantino;Gian Marco Podda,covid-19

The management of postoperative polyuria and polydipsia can be challenging and fluid balance needs to be closely monitored. The classical triphasic pattern of endogenous vasopressin secretion--an initial phase of symptomatic diabetes insipidus occurring 24 hours after surgery; a second phase of inappropriate vasopressin secretion potentially causing hyponatraemia; and a third phase with a return to diabetes insipidus occurring up to 2 weeks later--is often complicated by cerebral salt wasting and thirst disorders. Inadequate adrenal replacement therapy and anticonvulsant agent treatment may increase the risk of life-threatening hyponatraemia in the course of desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment. Appropriate management, in order to avoid life-threatening or disabling electrolyte disturbances, requires a good grasp of the relevant pathophysiology.

In the present work, we assessed the possibilities of combined using of multiphoton microscopy (MPM) and optical coherence angiography (OCA) for differential diagnosis of the equivocal melanocytic lesions. Clinical and dermoscopic examinations of 60 melanocytic lesions revealed 10 benign lesions and 32 melanomas, while 18 lesions remained difficult to diagnose. Histopathological analysis of these lesions revealed 4 intradermal, 3 compound and 3 junctional nevi in the ""benign"" group, 7 superficial spreading, 14 lentigo maligna and 11 nodular melanomas in the ""melanoma"" group and 2 lentigo simplex, 4 dysplastic nevi, 6 melanomas in situ, 4 invasive lentigo melanomas and 2 invasive superficial spreading melanomas in the ""equivocal"" group. On the basis of MPM, a multiphoton microscopy score (MPMS) has been developed for quantitative assessment of melanoma features at the cellular level, that showed lower score for benign lesions compare with malignant ones. OCA revealed that the invasive melanoma has a higher vessel density and thicker blood vessels than melanoma in situ and benign lesions. Discriminant functions analysis of MPM and OCA data allowed to differentiate correctly between all equivocal melanocytic lesions. Therefore, we demonstrate, for the first time, that a combined use of MPM and OCA has the potential to improve early diagnosis of melanoma.",,V Elagin;E Gubarkova;O Garanina;D Davydova;N Orlinskaya;L Matveev;I Klemenova;I Shlivko;M Shirmanova;E Zagaynova,melanoma
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15579748/,Posterior pituitary dysfunction after traumatic brain injury,"Disorders of water balance are well recognized after traumatic brain injury (TBI), but there are no reliable data on their true prevalence in post-TBI patients. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of posterior pituitary dysfunction in a large cohort of survivors of TBI. One hundred two consecutive patients (85 males) who suffered severe or moderate TBI were evaluated for diabetes insipidus (DI) at a median of 17 months (range 6-36 months) after the event, using the 8-h water deprivation test (WDT). Their results were compared against normative data obtained from 27 matched, healthy controls. Patients' medical records were retrospectively reviewed for the presence of abnormalities of salt and water balance in the immediate post-TBI period. Twenty-two patients (21.6%) developed DI in the immediate post-TBI period (acute DI group), of whom five had abnormal WDT on later testing. In total, seven patients (6.9%) had abnormal WDT (permanent DI group), five of whom had partial DI. Patients in the acute and permanent DI groups were more likely to have more severe TBI, compared with the rest of the cohort (P < 0.05). In the immediate post-TBI period, 13 patients (12.9%) had syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, which persisted in one patient, and one other patient developed cerebral salt wasting. Diabetes insipidus and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone were common in the immediate post-TBI period. Permanent DI was present in 6.9% of patients who survived severe or moderate TBI, which is higher than traditionally thought. Identification of patients with partial posttraumatic DI is important because appropriate treatment may reduce morbidity and optimize the potential for recovery.",,Amar Agha;Evan Thornton;Patrick O'Kelly;William Tormey;Jack Phillips;Christopher J Thompson,diabetes

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12431131/,"Diabetes insipidus in children: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management","In diabetes insipidus, the amount of water ingested and the quantity and concentration of urine produced needs to be carefully regulated if fluid volume and osmolality are to be maintained within the normal range. One of the principal mechanisms controlling urine output is vasopressin which is released from the posterior pituitary gland and enhances water reabsorption from the renal collecting duct. In diabetes insipidus, the excessive production of dilute urine, and the causes of this clinical picture can be divided into three main groups: the first is primary polydipsia where the amount of fluid ingested is inappropriately large; the second group is cranial diabetes insipidus where the production of vasopressin is abnormally low; and, the third group is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus where the kidney response to vasopressin is impaired. The history and examination may suggest an underlying explanation for diabetes insipidus but a range of baseline and more extensive investigations may be required before a diagnosis can be reached. These investigations are not without risk, and the results need to be interpreted carefully because children do not always segregate neatly into a particular diagnostic category on the basis of one test alone. Children with cranial diabetes insipidus typically respond to arginine vasopressin or its manufactured analogue, desmopressin, with an increase in urine osmolality and an associated reduction in urine output. Such children usually require neuroimaging to look for evidence of evolving CNS pathology, such as an intracranial tumour. Vasopressin ""replacement"" with desmopressin is the treatment of choice in patients with cranial diabetes insipidus although extreme caution is required when treating babies or small children because of the danger of fluid overload. Abnormal production of other pituitary hormones in children with CNS disease can also influence fluid balance. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be due to abnormal electrolyte concentrations, therefore these should be measured as part of the initial assessment. In a small number of children the defect is a primary abnormality of the vasopressin receptor or one of the water channel proteins (aquaporins) involved in water transport. The treatment of these patients is difficult and typically involves therapy with a diuretic such as chlorothiazide, as well as indomethacin. These agents enhance urine osmolality by their effect on circulating volume and renal solute and water handling. The fluid intake of most young children with primary polydipsia can be safely reduced to a more appropriate level.",,Tim Cheetham;Peter H Baylis,diabetes

Fourteen laboratories from 7 European countries tested a panel of 23 MAbs for immunohistological staining reactivity for malignant and non-malignant lesions involving the melanocytic lineage. A standardized immunoperoxidase procedure was used and the results were evaluated using a standard protocol and data evaluation form developed in collaboration with the EORTC Data Center. According to this analysis, the antibodies in the panel could be classified into 3 main groups. The first group of MAbs includes those antibodies which stained the majority (greater than 80%) of all primary tumors, irrespective of their Breslow thickness and the majority of metastatic lesions. In addition, these MAbs stained a high percentage of cells within a given lesion. Several antibodies of Group I were likewise reactive with the majority of naevoblasts and with normal melanocytes. The second group of MAbs included antibodies reacting only with a limited number of primary melanomas and metastatic lesions. Antibodies of Group II reacted only weakly, if at all, with normal melanocytes or naevocytes. The percentage of cells within a malignant lesion stained by these MAbs was always rather low. The MAb group III detected surface structures whose expression appeared to be related to tumor progression; they did not react or reacted only weakly with naevi, and they all reacted with a small number of early primary melanomas (less than 0.75 mm). The number of lesions stained increased with increasing Breslow thickness.

This is clearly a departure from all previously described cases, in which a leptomeningeal (pial-arachnoidal) origin was either defined or assumed. Clinically, this case was remarkable in its rarity, its presentation as a cerebellopontine angle syndrome, and its occurrence in a Negro, a race in which melanomas are uncommon. Ultrastructurally, the tumor did demonstrate the presence of basement membrane abnormalities and numerous endothelial fenestrations. However, it was found to be made up of a homogenous cell population, consisting only of electron-lucent, melanin-laden cells. The mixed cell population noted previously in a primary leptomeningeal melanoma was not found in this tumor. In view of the fact that this patient continues to do well 1 1/2 years after operation, with no evidence of tumor recurrence, it is suggested that a homogenous cell population noted on electron microscopy could indicate a better prognosis. In addition, it may also indicate a pachymeningeal rather than a leptomeningeal origin for the tumor.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1251770/,Renal function in normo- and hypertensive 50-year-old males,"Renal function, measure as glomerular filtration rate (GFR), sodium excretion and osmolality after thirst, has been determined in untreated (n=35) and treated (n=22) hypertensives and in a reference group (n=80), all derived from a random population sample of 50-year-old men. Renal function was related to casual and resting BP and to relative body weight. Hypertension was defined as SBP greater than 175 or DBP greater than 115 mmHg on two separate occasions or current antihypertensive treatment. Mean GFR was 100 +/- 11.7 ml/min in the reference group and significantly lower, 94 +/- 15.7 ml/min, in the hypertension group. In the hypertension group, 20% had a reduced GFR, although the standard diagnostic procedure, serum creatinine, demonstrated only 4%. Hypertensives with reduced GFR were characterized by higher BP, lower urinary sodium excretion, reversed diurnal rhythm of salt and water excretion and a higher relative body weight, which was, however, explained by the correlation of BP to relative body weight. GFR was negatively correlated to DBP at rest and positively correlated to urinary sodium excretion. Untreated hypertensives with persistent high BP after rest and lower GFR, lower urinary sodium excretion and reversed diurnal rhythm of salt and water excretion, indicating high renal resistance. The results suggest that subjects with relatively severe hypertension as judged by BP and renal function have an increased renal vascular resistance.",,G Berglund;M Aurell;L Wilhelmsen,hypertension

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7047599/,The nature of melanoma. A critical review,"The main object of this review was to examine the various histogenetic types of melanoma in order to determine their nature. Nodular melanoma and superficial spreading melanoma differ in the more rapid growth of the former. For tumors of equal depth of invasion in patients of the same sex, the prognoses are similar. Clinical features with prognostic significance are sex, age, and site of the lesion. Women have a decided superiority in survival up to the age of about 50 years when their superiority declines. Survival rates for men also decline after the age of 50 years but to a lesser degree. Melanomas of the extremities have a better prognosis than melanomas of the axial regions. The histological feature of most prognostic significance is depth of invasion (thickness). Ulceration is partly bound to thickness of the lesion, but has an augmentative effect of its own which is related to rate of growth. Thin lesions with or without regression are often associated with metastases. Melanomas arising in Hutchinson's melanotic freckle have a better prognosis than nodular or superficial spreading melanoma but there has not been any series large enough for definitive markers with prognostic significance to be determined. A similar state pertains in palmar, plantar and subungual melanomas. The initial surgical approach in nodular and superficial melanoma should be based upon the thickness of the tumour, site of the tumour, and sex of the patient. The current classification of malignant melanoma is unsatisfactory. Melanoma arising in Hutchinson's melanotic freckle seems to be a distinct entity. Melanomas of other histogenetic types would be best classified according to site.",,V J McGovern,melanoma
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8872829/,Obesity-related hypertension: its physiological basis and pharmacological approaches to its treatment,"Obesity-related hypertension is a common pathological disorder that can occur at any age and in any sex or race. Some of the metabolic, endocrinologic, adrenergic, and hemodynamic changes associated with this condition are reversed, in part, by weight reduction, which coincidentally decreases blood pressure (BP) in obese hypertensive patients. However, a major problem for obese hypertensives is dietary noncompliance. Consequently, a pharmacologic approach to obesity-related hypertension that meets the specific requirements of this complex pathological condition should be recommended when the initial nonpharmacological approach falls. Diuretics and beta-adrenergic blocking agents have been shown to be effective in decreasing BP in obese hypertensives, but they also decrease insulin sensitivity and increase cholesterol and lipoprotein concentrations. Calcium channel blockers, alpha 1-adrenoreceptor blocking, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor agents may offer an efficient and safe antihypertensive approach in obese hypertensive patients.",,R J Richards;V Thakur;E Reisin,hypertension

Chitosomes were prepared by directly hydrating the thin lipid film using chitosan solution as hydration medium, instead of using it as a coating agent. Developed chitosomes demonstrated spherical morphology, positive surface charge (~30 mV) and ~60% encapsulation efficiency. The calorimetric studies and X-ray diffraction pattern of Met-loaded chitosomes confirmed the successful encapsulation of Met inside the chitosome vesicles. Optimized chitosome formulation showed ~70% drug release in 72 h, displaying prolonged and controlled release of drug. Results demonstrated that Met encapsulated chitosomes possessed enhanced cellular internalization and improved cytotoxic potential. Our findings also supported inhibitory activity of chitosomes against metastatic property of pleural mesothelioma cells. The in-vitro tumor simulation studies further established anti-tumor activity of Met encapsulated chitosomes as supported by reduction in tumor volume and presence of minimal viable cells in tumor mass.

In a race to contain the infection, researchers and healthcare officials have developed several assays to help diagnose individuals with COVID-19. To help laboratories decide what assay to bring into testing lines, factors such as assay availability, cost, throughput, and TAT should be considered. Here we validated a modified version of the CDC assay and used it as a reference to evaluate the performance of the NeuMoDxTM SARS-CoV-2 and DiaSorin SimplexaTM Covid-19 Direct assays. In silico analysis and clinical sample testing showed that the primers/probes designed by the CDC were specific to the SARS-CoV-2 as they accurately detected all reactive samples with an assay LoD of 200 copies/mL. The performance of the three assays were analyzed using 159 nasopharyngeal swabs specimen tested within 1-5 days after routine testing. A 100 % agreement was observed between the commercial assays and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. A deeper look at the Ct values showed no significant difference between NeuMoDx and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay, whereas DiaSorin had lower overall Ct values than the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31404607/,Unraveling the crosstalk between melanoma and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,"Cutaneous melanoma is the most common skin cancer with an incidence that has been rapidly increasing in the past decades. Melanomas are among the most immunogenic tumors and, as such, have the greatest potential to respond favorably to immunotherapy. However, like many cancers, melanomas acquire various suppressive mechanisms, which generally act in concert, to escape innate and adaptive immune detection and destruction. Intense research into the cellular and molecular events associated with melanomagenesis, which ultimately lead to immune suppression, has resulted in the discovery of new therapeutic targets and synergistic combinations of immunotherapy, targeted therapy and chemotherapy. Tremendous effort to determine efficacy of single and combination therapies in pre-clinical and clinical phase I-III trials has led to FDA-approval of several immunotherapeutic agents that could potentially be beneficial for aggressive, highly refractory, advanced and metastatic melanomas. The increasing availability of approved combination therapies for melanoma and more rapid assessment of patient tumors has increased the feasibility of personalized treatment to overcome patient and tumor heterogeneity and to achieve greater clinical benefit. Here, we review the evolution of the immune system during melanomagenesis, mechanisms exploited by melanoma to suppress anti-tumor immunity and methods that have been developed to restore immunity. We emphasize that an effective therapeutic strategy will require coordinate activation of tumor-specific immunity as well as increased recognition and accessibility of melanoma cells in primary tumors and distal metastases. This review integrates available knowledge on melanoma-specific immunity, molecular signaling pathways and molecular targeting strategies that could be utilized to envision therapeutics with broader application and greater efficacy for early stage and advanced metastatic melanoma.",Checkpoint inhibition; Cutaneous melanoma; Cytokine therapy; DC; Immune escape; Immunotherapy; Innate and adaptive immunity; MDSC; Metabolites; Metastasis; NK; Suppression; T cells; Treg; Tumor microenvironment; Vaccination; microRNA.,Monica Marzagalli;Nancy D Ebelt;Edwin R Manuel,melanoma

She had a thirty-year history of treatment for intracranial hemangioblastoma due to von Hippel-Lindau disease and hydrocephalus. Head magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated recurrent multiple hemangioblastoma in the cerebellum without hydrocephalus. Chest computed tomography showed a migrated distal tube of a VPS into the thoracic cavity. The VPS had been revised several times because of repeated infection before the present admission. The hydrocephalus was considered to be independent on the VPS because the VPS had become obstructed. A pleural effusion, which was probably caused by hypoalbuminemia during the postoperative course of the hemangioblastoma, increased and disappeared in association with her postoperative nutritional status. Therefore, revision of the migrated distal catheter was not needed. The distal tube most likely migrated through the intercostal space because the patient was very skinny. Migration of the distal catheter of VPS into the thoracic cavity may occur when the course of the distal tube is close to the thoracic cavity, especially in thin patients.

Using a highly sensitive multiplex assay and positive/negative thresholds established in infants in whom maternal antibodies have waned, we determined that more than 90% of uninfected adults showed antibody reactivity against the spike protein, receptor-binding domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD), or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from SARS-CoV-2. This seroreactivity was evenly distributed across age and sex, correlated with circulating coronaviruses' reactivity, and was partially outcompeted by soluble circulating coronaviruses' spike. Using a custom SARS-CoV-2 peptide mapping array, we found that this antibody reactivity broadly mapped to spike and to conserved nonstructural viral proteins.

Based on daytime ambulatory blood pressure 173 were classified as established hypertensives and 111 as white coat hypertensives. A sample of 127 subjects drawn from the Danish national register served as a normotensive control group. It was found that urinary albumin/creatinine ratio differed significantly between the three groups; the difference remained significant after correction for covariables. Early morning urine albumin/creatinine ratio was weakly but significantly correlated to blood pressure. Early morning urine albumin/creatinine ratio was as reproducible a measure as 24-hour albumin excretion.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9085148/,Immunohistochemical localization of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in primary and metastatic malignant melanomas,"In embryos morphogenetically active cells transiently express the cholinergic system comprising cholinesterase activity and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Malignant melanomas develop from melanocytes, which are derived from the neural crest. Neural crest cells express the embryonic muscarinic system during migration. Using the monoclonal antibody M35, we now show that normal melanocytes carry no muscarinic receptors, whereas malignant melanoma cells express them again. In primary melanomas and metastatic melanomas, we identified muscarinic receptors in solid strands or groups of atypical cells. In all primary malignant melanomas studied we found inhomogeneous distributions of M35-immunoreactivity subdividing the tumors into three different zones. In the tumor center, groups or single cells often showed only little or even no immunofluorescence. In contrast, pericentrally we detected strong immunostaining in the conglomerations of atypical melanocytes. In the peripheral infiltration zone, intensely fluorescent cells in clusters or single, were spreading into the normal tissue, leading to a more patchy staining pattern. Melanocytes of nevi also possess muscarinic receptors, showing similar distribution patterns as in the melanoma. We suggest that in malignant melanomas muscarinic receptors might play a regulative role in infiltrative growth and metastasis.",,M Lammerding-Köppel;S Noda;A Blum;G Schaumburg-Lever;G Rassner;U Drews,melanoma

Melanomas arising in the head and neck region comprise some 20% of all melanomas; of these, 7-15% occur in the vicinity of the external ear (most often on the helix). Auricular melanomas, like those arising elsewhere, are rare in childhood and are most often first diagnosed in men in their 50s. Melanomas of the external ear may present as flat pigmented lesions or as raised mass lesions; amelanotic (non-pigmented) variants exist as well. Auricular melanomas are frequently recognized pathologically as either superficial spreading melanomas or nodular melanomas. These tumors are aggressive, with a propensity for spreading to both regional lymph nodes and distant sites. Key pathologic prognostic features of auricular melanomas include the histological subtype, tumor thickness, level of invasion and presence of ulceration. Therapy includes both aggressive surgical attempts at excision in combination with sentinel node sampling in some instances and perhaps, adjuvant therapy as well. This is a tumor which is often overlooked until late in its course, with tragic consequences; vigilance and aggressive attempts at identifying these tumors at earlier stages are strongly advocated.",,Vanni Mondin;Alessandra Rinaldo;Ashok R Shaha;Sebahattin Cureoglu;Kenneth O Devaney;Carlos Suárez;Alfio Ferlito,melanoma

Based on plasma norepinephrine (NE) resting values to subgroups of hypertensives were defined, one in the ""normal"" range (NE less than 268 pg/ml) and one in the ""high"" range (NE greater than 268 pg/ml). In response to graded exercise the ""high"" NE hypertensive patients showed a mean NE increase significantly higher than both normal controls and ""normal"" NE hypertensives (p less than 0.05). No significant differences in the electrolytes excretion rates were found between the two subsets, but only in the hyper-noradrenergic hypertensives a negative correlation between potassium excretion and circulating NE levels was observed (r = -0.68; p less than 0.005). These findings suggest that in the hypertensive population there is a not negligible proportion of patients with elevated NE levels under basal conditions which are, moreover, hyper-responsive to stressful situations.

This case report describes a 40-year-old man, who was diagnosed incidentally with TS, several years after the initial injury. Multiple, asymptomatic, left-sided pleural based lesions associated with a history of thoracoabdominal injury and splenectomy are the key points that should alert suspicion of TS, which can then simply be confirmed by a Tc-99m sulphur colloid radionuclide scan. Most patients are treated conservatively unless they are symptomatic.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10711738/,"Microvascular oxidative stress, immune reaction and apoptosis in hypertensives","The mechanisms that lead to organ injury in hypertension are incompletely understood. In particular, there is a lack of evidence that serves to link the elevation of arterial blood pressure with end organ damage. Experimental models of hypertension have a range of microvascular abnormalities in addition to a shift in blood pressure. There is evidence for an oxidative stress in microvascular endothelium derived from xanthine and NADPH oxidase. Furthermore, there exists an immune suppression accompanied by abnormally elevated circulating leukocyte counts, depression of selectin membrane adhesion to the endothelium and enhanced cell apoptosis. Many of the deficiencies in the spontaneously hypertensive rats can be corrected by adrenalectomy, suggesting a contribution of glucocorticoids to the abnormalities in this model. These observations suggest a significantly enhanced vascular oxidative stress which is accompanied by a frustrated inflammatory response due to a glucocorticoid dependent deficiency of leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium.",,H Suzuki;M Suematsu;G W Schmid-Schönbein,hypertension

However, its clinical significance in cutaneous melanoma has not been reported. qRT-PCR was performed to examine the expression of miR-106b in 15 cases of dysplastic nevi, 17 cases of melanoma metastases, and 97 cases of primary cutaneous melanoma tissue samples. Survival rate was determined with Kaplan-Meier and statistically analyzed with the log-rank method between groups. Survival data were evaluated through multivariate Cox regression analysis. Significant differences in miR-106b expression were shown between dysplastic nevi and primary cutaneous melanomas (P < 0.01), between primary melanomas and metastatic cutaneous melanomas (P < 0.01), and between primary cutaneous melanomas and metastatic cutaneous melanomas (P < 0.001). We found that high miR-106b expression was correlated with Breslow thickness (P = 0.002), tumor ulceration (P = 0.002), and advanced clinical stage (P < 0.001). The patients with high miR-106b expression showed shorter 5-year overall survival than those with low miR-106b expression (P = 0.02; log-rank test). Multivariate regression analysis showed that the status of miR-106b expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (HR = 2.09, 95%CI: 1.11-10.26, P = 0.02). This study showed that miR-106b may contribute to the progression of cutaneous melanoma and its up-regulation may be independently associated with poor prognosis of cutaneous melanoma.

The increased BP also enhances coronary arteriosclerosis, and the combination of myocardial and coronary effects increases the risk of myocardial infarction and arrhythmias. The risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD) is also influenced by smoking and lipid disturbances, and the risk of IHD events increases already at moderate BP elevation. It is important that the antihypertensive treatment does not adversely affect the arteriosclerotic process, which is a major threat for hypertensive patients. Trials of anti-hypertensive treatment have all been of low power and relatively short duration and therefore have not provided a definite answer concerning a significant effect on IHD. Investigations are being performed to determine whether certain drugs are more advantageous than others in preventing IHD events. In addition to their hypotensive effects in hypertensive patients, beta-blocking drugs may prevent IHD in accordance with their preventive effects in patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction. Diuretics may, however, be hazardous because of their effects on electrolytes-notably potassium-thereby increasing the risk of arrhythmias.",,L Wilhelmsen,hypertension

We conducted a case-control study in Samsun, Turkey, to examine the association between ACE genotype, ACE serum activity, and blood pressure. Serum ACE activity was measured and ACE I/D polymorphism performed in 165 hypertensive and 143 normotensive subjects. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR primers were flanking the polymorphic region in intron 16 of the ACE gene. The distribution of the DD, ID, and II ACE genotypes was 65, 77, and 23 in hypertensive patients and 42, 82, and 19 in normotensive subjects (P > .05). The estimated frequency of the insertion allele was 0.37 in hypertensive and 0.42 in normotensive subjects. Nevertheless, sensitivity analysis, based on positive family history and severity of hypertension, suggested that significant associations existed between more homogeneous groups of hypertensives and normotensives (P < .05). ACE genotype influenced ACE activity and the highest level was in DD genotype, being the lowest in II genotype. ACE serum levels were significantly higher in hypertensives as compared with normotensives (P < .01). A modest correlation was observed between blood pressure and ACE among hypertensive persons (r = 0.25, P < .05) and this did persist in multivariate analysis (P < .05 for systolic blood pressure and P < .005 for diastolic blood pressure).

They received a similar questionnaire 12 months later. Of the 178 patients 99 were not initially on treatment. Similarly 78 normotensive subjects were drawn randomly from the local population and sent a second questionnaire 10 months later. The symptoms at the first visit of the normotensive controls, the untreated hypertensive patients, and 477 patients on long-term treatment in the hypertension clinic were compared. Treated and untreated hypertensive patients complained more of nocturia and also of unsteadiness either on standing or in the morning. Treated hypertensives complained more of sleepiness, dry mouth, diarrhoea, and, in men, impotence and failure of ejaculation. Similarly, untreated hypertensives complained of excessive depression, blurred vision, and waking headache. Fifty-five of the normotensive subjects and 110 of the newly referred hypertensive patients responded to the second questionnaire. The proportions losing and gaining symptoms were calculated together with the proportions always complaining and never complaining of a symptom. Hypertensive patients tended to lose the complaints of unsteadiness and headache but to gain the symptoms of vivid dreams, a slow walking pace, and diarrhoea. The net improvement for a symptom was defined as the excess of patients who lost a symptom over those who gained the symptom, expressed as a percentage. Over the follow-up period the control subjects had a net improvement averaged over 14 symptoms of +2-4 per cent. A similar result was obtained for the hypertensive patients of +2-0 per cent, the symptoms lost being balanced by those gained. The changes in symptoms with time were related to the changes in blood pressure and it is suggested that only headache, 'unsteadiness, lightheadedness, or faintness' and nocturia can actually result from raised blood pressure and then only in a proportion of patients complaining of these symptoms.",,C J Bulpitt;C T Dollery;S Carne,hypertension

In recent years, there is an increase in the incidence and aggressiveness of melanomas. The number of treatment options has grown considerably in the past few years, leading to significant improvements in both overall and progression-free survival. One of the attractive candidates in this wave of treatment options is a cell cycle controller: cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors. CDK4/6, a class of serine/threonine kinases expressed in most cell types, controls the first gap phase (G1 to S) of the cell cycle, indicating its vital importance in both normal cellular processes as well as tumorigenesis. Up to 90% of melanoma patients have genomic mutations affecting various parts of CDK4/6 pathway. Noticeably, with the help of next-generation sequencing technology, mutations with high frequency in the CDK4 pathway were also identified in relatively rare subtypes of melanoma including acral melanoma and mucosal melanoma. Therefore, CDK4/6 inhibitors have emerged as powerful and promising anticancer therapies, especially in combination treatment with immunotherapies or other targeted therapies. In this review, we will provide an overview of current scientific knowledge regarding the oncogenic properties of CDK4/6 in melanomas, we mainly discuss the latest genomic and preclinical findings of CDK4 signaling in melanoma, the progress of CDK4 inhibition as combined with other therapies for overcoming resistance and summarize recent advances from clinical trials as well as ongoing studies which gives us a better scope into the effectiveness of CDK4/6 therapy in treating malignant melanomas.",CDK4/6 inhibitor; Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4/6; Genome; Melanoma; Resistance; Targeted therapy.,Linghong Guo;Jinxin Qi;Han Wang;Xian Jiang;Yin Liu,melanoma

However, little information is available defining which determinants of SARS-CoV-2 other than the spike glycoprotein are recognized by the host immune system. In this study, we focus on the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein as a suitable candidate target for vaccine formulations. Major B and T cell epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein are predicted and resulting sequences compared with the homolog immunological domains of other coronaviruses that infect human beings. The most dominant of B cell epitope is located between 176-206 amino acids in the SRGGSQASSRSSSRSRNSSRNSTPGSSRGTS sequence. Further, we identify sequences which are predicted to bind multiple common MHC I and MHC II alleles. Most notably there is a region of potential T cell cross-reactivity within the SARS-CoV-2 N protein position 102-110 amino acids that traverses multiple human alpha and betacoronaviruses. Vaccination strategies designed to target these conserved epitope regions could generate immune responses that are cross-reactive across human coronaviruses, with potential to protect or modulate disease.

The mean Ki-67 (MIB-1) proliferation rates for the compound nevi, Spitz nevi, minimal deviation melanomas, and superficial spreading malignant melanomas were 0, 3%, 13%, and 25%, respectively. The mean Ki-67 proliferation rate was statistically greater in the minimal deviation melanomas than in the compound nevi or the Spitz nevi (P <.05), but the proliferation rates in the two melanoma subtypes were not statistically significant (P =.08). The mean p53 values for these lesions were 0, 9%, 9%, and 26%, respectively; the latter two were statistically different (P <.01). Based on these Ki-67 and p53 immunophenotypes, minimal deviation melanoma may represent a distinct entity.",,Joe A Chorny;Ronald J Barr;Ainura Kyshtoobayeva;James Jakowatz;Richard J Reed,melanoma

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11181969/,Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, which can be inherited or acquired, is characterized by an inability to concentrate urine despite normal or elevated plasma concentrations of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin. Polyuria, with hyposthenuria, and polydipsia are the cardinal clinical manifestations of the disease. About 90% of patients with congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus are males with the X-linked recessive form of the disease (OMIM 304800) who have mutations in the arginine vasopressin receptor 2 gene (AVPR2), which codes for the vasopressin V2 receptor. The gene is located in chromosomal region Xq28. In <10% of the families studied, congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus has an autosomal-recessive or autosomal-dominant (OMIM 222000 and 125800, respectively) mode of inheritance. Mutations have been identified in the aquaporin-2 gene (AQP2), which is located in chromosome region 12q13 and codes for the vasopressin-sensitive water channel. When studied in vitro, most AVPR2 mutations result in receptors that are trapped intracellularly and are unable to reach the plasma membrane. A few mutant receptors reach the cell surface but are unable to bind arginine vasopressin or to properly trigger an intracellular cyclic AMP signal. Similarly, aquaporin-2 mutant proteins are misrouted and cannot be expressed at the luminal membrane. Chemical or pharmacological chaperones have been found to reverse the intracellular retention of aquaporin-2 and arginine vasopressin receptor 2 mutant proteins. Because many hereditary diseases stem from the intracellular retention of otherwise functional proteins, this mechanism may offer a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of those diseases that result from errors in protein kinesis.",,J P Morello;D G Bichet,diabetes

We measured plasma and urinary endothelin 1 (ET-1) in 20 untreated essential hypertensives with normal renal function, in eight normotensive healthy subjects, and in 13 hypertensive patients with primary renoparenchymal disease. Plasma ET-1 was higher (P < 0.01) in essential hypertensives (median 1.69, interquartile range 1.2-3.3 pg/ml) than in normal subjects (0.84, 0.37-1.10 pg/ml) but significantly less (P < 0.01) than in hypertensives with renoparenchymal disease (3.57, 1.45-9.52 pg/ml). ET-1 levels slightly correlated with diastolic pressure in essential hypertensives (r = 0.43, P < 0.05) and tended to be correlated with systolic pressure in hypertensives with renal disease (r = 0.47, P = 0.08). ET-1 excretion in essential hypertensives (137, 99-154 ng/24 h) and in normal subjects (120, 62-150 ng/24 h) was significantly lower than in renal hypertensives (191, 123-241 ng/24 h).

Since the ClET/GFR ratio should be 100% if all filtered ET-1 is excreted, the data indicate that ET-1 is synthesized at a reduced rate and/or broken down at an enhanced rate by the kidney in essential hypertension and confirm that there is a high ET-1 generation rate in remnant nephrons in hypertension secondary to renal disease.",,C Zoccali;D Leonardis;S Parlongo;F Mallamaci;M Postorino,hypertension

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8618142/,A compartmental model predicts that dietary potassium affects lithium dynamics in rats,"Lithium is the treatment of choice for manic depression, but therapy often results in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and lithium intoxication. To investigate the effects of dietary potassium on potential side effects of lithium therapy, a mathematical model was built using the modeling program SAAM (Simulation, Analysis, And Modeling). Experimental data modeled were from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats fed diets with or without lithium and one of three levels of potassium for 17 d. A five-compartment model of lithium dynamics was built that was consistent with data from rats fed a lithium-containing diet adequate in potassium. This model was then compared with data from rats fed the other two lithium-containing diets. The model predicts that both the fractional transfer coefficient and rate of transport of lithium to the serum compartment from the kidney compartment are lower in rats fed the potassium-adequate diet than in those fed the potassium-deficient diet, and even lower in those fed the potassium-supplemented diet. In addition, fractional transfer coefficients into the serum compartment from the sampled and simulated tissue compartments changed differently with time depending on the amount of dietary potassium. The model also predicts that there would be less accumulation of lithium in the kidney, sampled tissue and simulated tissue compartments with supplemental dietary potassium. The model suggests that potassium supplementation, after a 7-d delay, protects against nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and the potentially toxic accumulation of lithium by decreasing the reabsorption of lithium from the kidneys and increasing lithium efflux from the tissues.",,H B Everts;H Jang;R C Boston;N L Canolty,diabetes

In the younger age group (20-35 y) both distensibility and cross-sectional compliance were significantly less in the borderline hypertensive group. In the older borderline hypertensive subjects (50-69 y) distensibility (p less than 0.05) and cross-sectional compliance (p = 0.06) were also less than in the control subjects. The reduced distensibility and cross-sectional compliance likely result from a decrease in arterial wall elasticity because the relative increase in common carotid artery diameter during systole is diminished in borderline hypertensives, despite the fact that their pulse pressure is similar to or higher than that in control subjects. The less pronounced differences in vessel wall properties between borderline hypertensive and normotensive volunteers in the older age group may be a consequence of the changes in these properties with age, partly masking the alterations due to borderline hypertension. Since the stiffer behavior of the common carotid artery in borderline hypertensives is associated with relatively slight changes in blood pressure, the question can be raised whether the alterations in arterial wall properties are really a result of the elevated arterial blood pressure; these alterations might develop independent of the blood pressure elevation.",,T Van Merode;P J Hick;A P Hoeks;K H Rahn;R S Reneman,hypertension

The performance of the RT-PCR was evaluated in 43 clinical samples, of which 10 and 33 were previously identified as negative and positive, respectively, by RT-qPCR.

Here, 32/33 of the positive samples in the RT-qPCR, including from asymptomatic individuals, were found positive in the RT-PCR (Ct 15.94-34.92). The analytical sensitivity of the assay was about 7.15-9 copies of vRNA/μL, and nonspecific amplifications were not observed in SARS-CoV-2 negative samples. Importantly, the RT-PCR reactions were performed in a 10 μL final volume.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26825037/,Endothelin-1 in the tumor microenvironment correlates with melanoma invasion,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a vasoactive peptide that also plays a role in the tanning response of the skin. Animal and cell culture studies have also implicated ET-1 in melanoma progression, but no association studies have been performed to link ET-1 expression and melanoma in humans. Here, we present the first in-vivo study of ET-1 expression in pigmented lesions in humans: an ET-1 immunohistochemical screen of melanocytic nevi, melanoma in situ lesions, invasive melanomas, metastatic melanomas, and blue nevi was performed. Twenty-six percent of melanocytic nevi and 44% of melanoma in situ lesions demonstrate ET-1 expression in the perilesional microenvironment, whereas expression in nevus or melanoma cells was rare to absent. In striking contrast, 100% of moderately to highly pigmented invasive melanomas contained numerous ET-1-positive cells in the tumor microenvironment, with 79% containing ET-1-positive melanoma cells, confirmed by co-staining with melanoma tumor marker HMB45. Hypopigmented invasive melanomas had reduced ET-1 expression, suggesting a correlation between ET-1 expression and pigmented melanomas. ET-1-positive perilesional cells were CD68-positive, indicating macrophage origin. Sixty-two percent of highly pigmented metastatic melanomas demonstrated ET-1 expression in melanoma cells, in contrast to 28.2% of hypopigmented specimens. Eighty-nine percent of benign nevi, known as blue nevi, which have a dermal localization, were associated with numerous ET-1-positive macrophages in the perilesional microenvironment, but no ET-1 expression was detected in the melanocytes. We conclude that ET-1 expression in the microenvironment increases with advancing stages of melanocyte transformation, implicating a critical role for ET-1 in melanoma progression, and the importance of the tumor microenvironment in the melanoma phenotype.",,Luis Chiriboga;Shane Meehan;Iman Osman;Michael Glick;Gelo de la Cruz;Brittny S Howell;George Friedman-Jiménez;Robert J Schneider;Sumayah Jamal,melanoma

Each of these components has the potential to limit severe, high-shedding cases over time under the right circumstances, but in combination they can rapidly reduce the frequency of more severe and infectious manifestation of disease over a wide range of conditions.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34272205/,The evolution of rapid antigen detection systems and their application for COVID-19 and other serious respiratory infectious diseases,"Making the correct diagnosis of a patient seeking medical attention is the ultimate goal of a practicing physician, irrespective of whether the cause of the patient's condition is infectious or non-infectious. Antigen detection tests can be used to aid in the diagnosis of various infectious-related disorders including COVID-19 where it has become especially important due to the serious nature of this disease and its worldwide prevalence. These tests closely mimic one of the earliest prototypes - the urine pregnancy test - and as a result they have gained wide acceptance based on their overall simplicity, low cost and relative accuracy. In some situations, especially as a screening test, they can be used instead of the more technically demanding and complex molecular and serologic assays that are still useful and helpful under many different circumstances. Antigen detection systems are based on finding a particular immunogenic component, typically a protein or polysaccharide molecule, that is both unique and an integral part of the pathogen or other biological entity. Because these tests generally provide only qualitative results, they often need to be supplemented with other and sometimes more sophisticated laboratory-based diagnostic procedures to corroborate the initial test result. In this review, we first describe general background information on antigen-detection methods, including any unique aspects of their overall design, and then follow with an extensive description on the merits and limitations of these tests for detecting COVID-19 and, to a lesser extent, for other serious respiratory diseases caused by three common bacterial pathogens - Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila.",Antigen-detection; COVID-19; Legionella pneumophila; SARS-Cov-2; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Streptococcus pyogenes.,Charles S Pavia;Maria M Plummer,covid-19

Frozen section examination has a 12-15% failure rate, the incidence of clinically erroneous diagnosis being about 15-20%. Consequently, the first step in treatment is still an extensive excisional biopsy, although the dimensions of the excision in the head and neck region may be smaller than in other regions of the body to take account of functionally important tissues. A radical neck dissection should be performed if the depth of the primary tumor is greater than 0.75 mm and less than 4 mm. Malignant melanomas less than 0.75 mm deep will rarely metastasise.

Melanomas are classified into two types: melanotic and amelanotic. Prior research suggests that human amelanotic melanomas are more aggressive than their melanotic counterparts. This study evaluates the behavior of canine melanotic and amelanotic oral cavity melanomas and quantifies cell proliferation and the expression of connexins. Twenty-five melanomas (16 melanotic and 9 amelanotic) were collected from dogs during clinical procedures at the Veterinary Hospital of the School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science of the University of São Paulo, Brazil. After diagnosis, dogs were followed until death or euthanasia. Histopathology confirmed the gross melanotic or amelanotic characteristics and tumors were classified according to the WHO. HMB45 or Melan A immunostainings were performed to confirm the diagnosis of amelanotic melanomas. Cell proliferation was quantified both by counting mitotic figures and PCNA positive nuclei. Expressions of connexins 26 and 43 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR and Western blot. Dogs bearing amelanotic melanomas presented a shorter lifespan in comparison to those with melanotic melanomas. Cell proliferation was significantly higher in amelanotic melanomas. Expressions of Connexins 26 and 43 were significantly reduced in amelanotic melanomas.

It is usually diagnosed at a locally advanced stage (Breslow thickness <2 mm) and is therefore associated with a poor prognosis. Nodular melanoma often does not fit the classic clinical ABCD criteria, but rather the EFG rule or 3 Cs criteria. Missing the diagnosis of nodular melanoma is a dermatologist's worst nightmare, especially since nodular melanomas can have a non-alarming clinical appearance and imitate a wide range of benign lesions. All evolving nodular lesions, despite their size, symmetry, and color, which cannot be confidently diagnosed as benign, should be excised in order to rule out nodular melanoma. Almost all melanoma-specific dermoscopic criteria are described in context of superficial spreading melanoma. Thus, physicians are not familiar and aware enough of dermoscopic features for early detection of nodular melanomas.

As an alternative, we describe here how to express and purify Taq polymerase and M-MLV reverse transcriptase and assemble a homemade one-step RT-qPCR master mix. This mix can be easily assembled from scratch in any laboratory equipped for protein purification. We also describe two simple alternative methods to prepare clinical swab samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by RT-qPCR: heat-inactivation for direct addition, and concentration of RNA by isopropanol precipitation. Finally, we describe how to perform RT-qPCR using the homemade master mix, how to prepare in vitro-transcribed RNA standards, and how to use a fluorescence imager for endpoint detection of RT-PCR amplification in the absence of a qPCR machine In addition to being useful for diagnostics, these versatile protocols may be adapted for nucleic acid quantification in basic research. © 2021 The Authors.

We hypothesized that the white coat phenomenon was due to greater blood pressure reactivity to the stress of a clinic visit and that, as a consequence, white coat hypertensive patients would display greater blood pressure reactivity to exercise and mental stress, as well as increased emotional reactivity and higher levels of anger, anxiety, or depression. We studied 89 patients with essential hypertension between 29 and 59 years old with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, treadmill exercise testing with oxygen consumption measurement, mental stress testing (including mental arithmetic, public speaking, and video game tasks), and psychological testing (State-Trait Anxiety Scale, Cook-Medley Hostility Scale, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, emotional reactivity scale). We defined white coat hypertension as a mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure of 135 mm Hg or less and diastolic 85 mm Hg or less and persistent hypertension as a mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more or diastolic 90 mm Hg or more. Forty-nine patients were classified as persistent hypertensives and 20 as white coat hypertensives. No significant differences were seen in demographic or clinical characteristics, fitness level, blood pressure response to exercise or mental stress, or psychological characteristics, except that white coat hypertensive patients had lower systolic blood pressures in the clinic and during exercise and greater variability of clinic diastolic blood pressures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,W C Siegel;J A Blumenthal;G W Divine,hypertension
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16629872/,Diagnosis and management of hypertension in obesity,"Cardiovascular risk in a patient with obesity hypertension increases with the extent of risk factor clustering. It is therefore important to determine the global risk of a patient with hypertension rather than to focus solely on blood pressure. Every hypertensive should be screened for other than blood pressure risk factors, target organ damage and concomitant diseases or accompanying clinical conditions. Assessment of blood pressure and target organ damage might be more difficult in obese hypertensives than in normal-weight patients. Intensive lifestyle interventions can reduce weight, and decrease blood pressure and cardiovascular risk in obese hypertensive patients. Current guidelines do not provide specific recommendation for pharmacological management of the hypertensive patients with obesity. Recent trials have consistently shown that therapy involving beta-blockers and diuretics may induce more new-onset diabetes compared with other combination therapies. Several lines of evidence suggest that anti-hypertensive agents that block the renin-angiotensin system may be especially beneficial in treating obese hypertensive patients. Hypertension management in obese individuals is complicated by poorer response to treatment, and the increased need for multiple medications. It is important to consider obstructive sleep apnoea in the differential diagnosis of hypertensive patients who respond poorly to combination therapy with anti-hypertensive medications.",,K Narkiewicz,hypertension

The aim of our study was to determine the clinical, paraclinical, etiological and therapeutic profile of secondary HTA of endocrine origin in patients treated in endocrinology department at the University Hospital Mohamed VI in Marrakech. We conducted a prospective, descriptive study spanned 4 years, enrolling 45 patients with endocrine HTA. The average age was 44.89 years, with a clear predominance of women (sex ratio 0.49). Etiology of endocrine HTA was dominated by pheochromocytoma (17 cases), hypercorticism (11 cases) and acromegaly (8 cases). HTA were paroxysmal in 24.4%. HTA were immediately classified as grade 3 severe in 40% of cases. HTA were complicated by heart disease in 24% of cases and by renal disease in 20% of cases. Curative treatment cleared up HTA in 60% of cases (27 cases). The diagnosis of secondary endocrine HTA is sometimes difficult because of the lack of clinical specificity. It is not unusual for HTA to be the only manifestation of the disease. In our study we noted the paroxysmal and severe nature of HTA.

Impedance cardiography, which assesses cardiac function by measuring the opposition to an alternating electric current in the thorax, indicates the amount of fluid in the thorax. It is used externally by employing electrodes on the thorax but can also be used internally by electrodes within a cardiac pacemaker.

Immunocytochemical evidence for predominance of the oxytocin-neurophysin system compared to the vasopressin-neurophysin system,"The paraventricular nucleus of the rat hypothalamus has been shown to project to the medulla and spinal cord. The proportion of oxytocin-neurophysin (OTNP) axons to vasopressin-neurophysin (VPNP) axons in these structures is unknown. A major difficulty in resolving this problem in previous immunocytochemical studies was the lack of a specific antiserum to each rat neurophysin. In this study two approaches have been used: (1) comparison of immunostaining for neurophysin in normal versus homozygous Brattleboro rats with diabetes insipidus (HODI) which lack VPNP, and (2) application of an antiserum to both rat neurophysins absorbed with HODI rat hypothalamic-pituitary extracts which contain only OTNP. The latter would result in an antiserum specific for VPNP. Our results indicate that the axons which constitute the caudal projections from the paraventricular nucleus are predominately oxytocinergic, the vasopressinergic innervation being limited to the nucleus tractus solitarius, the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, and the substantia gelatinosa. A similar number of reactive fibers were seen in the medulla and spinal cord of normal and HODI rats. No positive perikarya were observed caudal to the hypothalamus. Fibers in the medulla appeared to terminate in the nucleus of the solitary tract and in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. Positive fibers throughout the cord were present in the substantia gelatinosa and in the intermediolateral grey.

While, in malignant hypertensions, and pheochromocytoma, headache is a cardinal symptom, its causal connection with permanently raised blood pressure in the ""benign"" forms is viewed with scepticism. The observation that hypertensives frequently complain of headaches with a maximum intensity in the early hours of the morning is connected with the fall in blood pressure with accumulation of CO2 in shallow breathing.

Neutralization activity correlated among the different assays; however the sVNT assay was overvaluing the low neutralizing plasma. On the other hand, the sVNT assay required the lowest biosafety level, is fast and is sufficient to identify highly neutralizing plasma samples. Though weakly neutralizing samples were more reliable detected by the more challenging lentiviral vector based assays or virus neutralization assays.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21879656/,Preoperative preparation of patients with pituitary gland disorders,"This paper presents the most common disorders of pituitary function: acromegaly, hypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus and syndrome similar to diabetes insipidus, in terms of their importance in preoperative preparation of patients. Pituitary function manages almost the entire endocrine system using the negative feedback mechanism that is impaired by these diseases. The cause of acromegaly is a pituitary adenoma, which produces growth hormone in adults. Primary therapy of acromegaly is surgical, with or without associated radiotherapy. If a patient with acromegaly as comorbidity prepares for non-elective neurosurgical operation, then it requires consultation with brain surgeons for possible delays of that operation and primary surgical treatment of pituitary gland. If operative treatment of pituitary gland is carried out, the preoperative preparation (for other surgical interventions) should consider the need for perioperative glucocorticoid supplementation. Panhypopituitarism consequences are different in children and adults and the first step in diagnosis is to assess the function of target organs. Change of electrolytes and water occurs in the case of pituitary lesions in the form of central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus as a syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Preoperative preparation of patients with pituitary dysfunction should be multidisciplinary, whether it is a neurosurgical or some other surgical intervention. The aim is to evaluate the result of insufficient production of pituitary hormones (hypopituitarism), excessive production of adenohypophysis hormones (acromegaly, Cushing's disease and hyperprolactinemia) and the influence of pituitary tumours in surrounding structures (compression syndrome) and to determine the level of perioperative risk. Pharmacological suppressive therapy of the hyperfunctional pituitary disorders can have significant interactions with drugs used in the perioperative period.",,Vesna Malenković;Ljiljana Gvozdenović;Branko Milaković;Vera Sabljak;Nebojsa Ladjević;Vladan Zivaljević,diabetes

However, heterozygous dominant pathogenic variants in Wolfram syndrome type 1 (WFS1) may lead to distinct, allelic conditions, described as isolated sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), syndromic SNHL, congenital cataracts, or early onset DM. We report a family with a novel dominant, likely pathogenic variant in WFS1 (NM_006005.3) c.2605_2616del12 (p.Ser869_His872del), resulting in cataracts, SNHL, and DM in a female and her mother. A maternal aunt had cataracts, DM, and SNHL but was not tested for the familial WFS1 mutation. Both the mother and maternal aunt had early menopause by age 43 years and infertility which may be a coincidental finding that has not been associated with autosomal dominant AD WFS1-related disorder to the best of our knowledge.

A challenge to dermatologists to examine every new patient at increased risk for signs of early melanoma,"Preventing death from malignant melanoma is the most pressing issue in preventive dermatology in the United States because the mortality rate has increased markedly. Dermatologists, as the physicians best suited by training to identify early malignant melanoma, need to take the lead in developing a national project of educating physicians, patients, and the public to recognize the clinical features of early malignant melanoma and to appreciate that prompt excision results in a high rate of cure. The immediate challenge is to commit ourselves to examining every new patient and to conducting periodic ""skin scans"" of every patient at increased risk for melanoma. Just as the Papanicolaou screening test has markedly reduced cervical cancer mortality rates, commitment to early identification and excision of melanomas can mean a comparable triumph for preventive dermatology and will help us meet the challenge of our Australian colleagues to make melanoma a word, not a death sentence.",,J B Howell,melanoma

The aim of this study was to compare and analyze the detection performance of three different commercially available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kits: Sansure Biotech, GeneFinderTM, and TaqPathTM on 354 randomly selected samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients. All PCR reactions were performed using the same RNA isolates and one real-time PCR machine. The final result of the three evaluated kits was not statistically different (p = 0.107), and also had a strong positive association and high Cohen's κ coefficient. In contrast, the average Ct values that refer to the ORF1ab and N gene amplification were significantly different (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively), with the lowest obtained by the TaqPathTM for the ORF1ab and by the Sansure Biotech for the N gene. The results show a high similarity in the analytical sensitivities for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which indicates that the diagnostic accuracy of the three assays is comparable. However, the SanSure Biotech kit showed a bit better diagnostic performance.

Clinical assessment of cardiac hypertrophy may be precisely obtained with echocardiography. Structural vascular changes may be evaluated indirectly in man by measuring minimal vascular resistance from maximal blood flow and arterial pressure. The results of a large number of studies have indicated that in hypertensive patients a significant regression of cardiovascular structural changes may be obtained with several antihypertensive drugs, but they have not yet established whether a complete ""normalization"" may be really obtained. Further studies are needed to identify factors that modulate regression of cardiac and vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy.

Methods that do not explicitly account for disease prevalence and uncertainty therein can lead to significant classification errors. We present a novel method that leverages optimal decision theory to address this problem. As a preliminary step, we develop an analysis that uses an assumed prevalence and conditional probability models of diagnostic measurement outcomes to define optimal (in the sense of minimizing rates of false positives and false negatives) classification domains. Critically, we demonstrate how this strategy can be generalized to a setting in which the prevalence is unknown by either (i) defining a third class of hold-out samples that require further testing or (ii) using an adaptive algorithm to estimate prevalence prior to defining classification domains. We also provide examples for a recently published SARS-CoV-2 serology test and discuss how measurement uncertainty (e.g. associated with instrumentation) can be incorporated into the analysis. We find that our new strategy decreases classification error by up to a decade relative to more traditional methods based on confidence intervals. Moreover, it establishes a theoretical foundation for generalizing techniques such as receiver operating characteristics by connecting them to the broader field of optimization.",SARS-CoV-2; antibody; classification; optimal decision theory; serology.,Paul N Patrone;Anthony J Kearsley,covid-19

To this end, we sequenced small RNAs (18-30 nucleotides) isolated from an annotated series of invasive melanomas (average invasive depth, 2.0 mm), common melanocytic nevi, and matched normal skin (n=28). Our previously established bioinformatics pipeline identified 765 distinct mature known miRNAs and defined a set of top 40 list that clearly segregated melanomas into thin (0.75 mm) and thick (2.7 mm) groups. Among the top, miR-21-5p, let-7b-5p, let-7a-5p, miR-424-5p, miR-423-5p, miR-21-3p, miR-199b-5p, miR-182-5p, and miR-205-5p were differentially expressed between thin and thick melanomas. In a validation cohort (n=167), measured expression of miR-21-5p and miR-424-5p, not previously reported in melanoma, were significantly increased in invasive compared with in situ melanomas (P<0.0001). Increased miR-21-5p levels were significantly associated with invasive depth (P=0.038), tumor mitotic index (P=0.038), lymphovascular invasion (P=0.0036), and AJCC stage (P=0.038).

One hundred and forty subjects from 23,940 people in whom borderline to mild hypertension was found at group medical examinations in each district, where a total of 29,940 people were examined, were registered to a educational course of new salt-restriction program. Salt intake was estimated from salt measurement in 24-hour urine samples. Educational program was composed of many lectures, sampling party and individualized consultations about dietary problems, using an original dietary questionnaire list.

For this reason, the extent and consequence of patient and professional delay in diagnosis and treatment was investigated in 233 patients with histologically proven primary cutaneous melanomas seen at the Department of Dermatology and Allergology at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany, between January 1999 and January 2001. Personal interviews were conducted by two physicians to obtain information on patients' knowledge of melanoma symptoms, sun behaviour, delay in seeking medical attention, professional delay and related factors. The main component of delay was patient related. Nearly one-third (29.2%) of all patients reported a delay interval of more than 12 months from the onset of an observed change in a pigmented lesion or first detection of a pigmented lesion to the first visit to a physician. The delay interval from the first visit to a physician to surgical treatment was shorter (< 1 month) in most of our patients (74.7%). The predominant symptoms of melanoma detected by patients were a change in colour and an increase in size or elevation. Most patients had obtained knowledge about cutaneous melanomas from television and magazines. A delay in diagnosis and a history of many sunburns and outdoor leisure time activities were not associated with a greater tumour thickness. However, fairer skin types, lower education levels and lack of knowledge about cutaneous melanoma were associated with a greater tumour thickness. Further efforts are necessary to improve public and medical education about early detection and prompt surgical treatment, which is known to be the most effective treatment modality for cutaneous melanomas.",,M H Schmid-Wendtner;J Baumert;J Stange;M Volkenandt,melanoma

Here, we evaluated two SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests: the STANDARD™ F COVID-19 Ag FIA (FIA) and the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (RAT). For diagnostic assessment, we used a large set of PCR-positive and PCR-negative respiratory swabs from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients and health care workers in the setting of two University Hospitals in Munich, Germany, i.e. emergency rooms, patient care units or employee test centers. For FIA, overall clinical sensitivity and specificity were 45.4% (n = 381) and 97.8% (n = 360), respectively, and for RAT, 50.3% (n = 445) and 97.7% (n = 386), respectively.

Rapid increase in the COVID-19 cases across the world requires fast and efficient testing as testing capacity is a bottleneck in diagnosis. In this context, pooling strategy can be opted for rapid testing in a cost-effective manner. In this study, the authors have optimized and compared the effect of pooling (5 and 10 samples) before and after nucleic acid extraction. It was concluded that there was no significant difference in the SARS CoV-2 RNA detection in the pools prepared at sample or RNA level. Even after pooling, 10-fold dilution was detectable with 3-cycle threshold value change in both type of pools when compared with individual samples. Hence, sample pool size of 10 can be used in low-prevalent areas, and testing capacity can be substantially increased.",COVID-19; Cycle threshold; Deconvolution; Nucleic acid testing; Pool testing.,Komal Chhikara;Poonam Kanta;Arnab Ghosh;Rishi Chetanya Prakash;Kapil Goyal;Mini P Singh,covid-19

Basal plasma ANP concentration was least in young normotensives, intermediate in old normotensives and young hypertensives, and highest in old hypertensives. Nifedipine, a known stimulator of ANP secretion, acutely increased plasma ANP in young and old normotensive subjects but not in young hypertensive patients and half of the old hypertensive patients. Increase in serum ANP level in response to nifedipine did not augment its hypotensive effect.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22579793/,Use of a molecular approach for the definitive diagnosis of proliferative larval mesocestoidiasis in a cat,"A 9 year-old male, neutered cat with a history of a sudden onset of lethargy, anorexia and respiratory distress was presented in a veterinary practice in Lucca, Italy. A clinical examination revealed that the cat was severely dehydrated, and had pale mucous membranes and tachypnoea. No pain or discomfort was detected at the time of physical examination. The cat was administered fluids, antibiotics and supportive therapy, but died overnight. The owner of the cat requested for a post mortem examination to be conducted. At necropsy, acephalic structures, consistent with proliferative tapeworm (cestode) larvae, were detected in the thoracic cavity on pleural surfaces. As these larvae could not be identified to genus or species by microscopy, a PCR-based sequencing-phylogenetic approach was used. Part of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene was PCR-amplified from genomic DNAs from five individual larvae and sequenced; all five sequences obtained were identical. This consensus sequence was aligned (over 355 nucleotide positions) with homologous sequences representing a range of cestodes (including Echinococcus granulosus, Echinococcus multilocularis, Hymenolepis microstoma, Mesocestoides spp. and Taenia saginata) from previously published studies and then subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The sequence representing the larval cestode from the affected cat grouped, with strong statistical support, with those representing Mesocestoides corti and Mesocestoides lineatus. Therefore, a definitive diagnosis of pleural proliferative larval mesocestoidiasis could be made. This study illustrates the value of using molecular tools to directly assist clinical and pathological investigations of cestodiases of animals.",,Abdul Jabbar;Roberto Papini;Nadia Ferrini;Robin B Gasser,chest

Fifty-two patients with essential hypertension and 22 normotensives were studied. The mean Li efflux, both into sodium (Na) medium and Li-Na countertransport, was higher in hypertensive than in normotensive persons, but the distinction between the two groups was limited by extended scatter and overlap. The distinction could be markedly improved by determining the effect of temperature on Li efflux. While all the normotensives exhibited Arrhenius plots of Li efflux with a change in slope (""break"") around 30 degrees C, the corresponding ""break"" for most (75%) of the hypertensives was about 20 degrees C. Consideration of both the rate and the temperature dependence of Li efflux further improved the differentiation of hypertensive patients. Analysis of normotensive offspring of hypertensives and of patients with secondary hypertension indicates that the temperature dependence of Li efflux may serve as a genetic marker for essential hypertension.",,R Levy;E Paran;A Keynan;A Livne,hypertension

They constituted about 50% of all patients admitted with local recurrence from melanoma during this period. At reexamination of the primary tumors, 16 were found to be malignant melanomas and 9 were nevi (four atypical and five benign). Twenty-one were missing, 11 of which had never been set for histologic examination. The median thickness of nine measurable melanomas was 0.66 mm. The recurrences in scar consisted of 34 primary melanomas: 18 superficial spreading, 4 nodular, 3 lentigo malignant, and 9 unclassified. Twelve tumors were dermal melanoma metastases. The median thickness of the 25 measurable melanomas was 0.78 mm. The 5-year overall survival was 69%. At the closing date of the study 15 patients had died, 13 of them because of disseminated melanoma. A comparison of the survival curves from this study with those from other series of melanomas with comparable tumor thickness indicates a considerably worse prognosis than is expected with such thin tumors. We believe that the considerable number of local recurrences in the form of a new primary in a scar following limited surgery supports the theory of limited field change around a primary melanoma.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2268509/,The role of 5-hydroxytryptamine and 5-hydroxytryptaminergic mechanisms in hypertension,"1. The possible role of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-HT-receptors in hypertension, already suggested by Page in 1954, has been subject to a renaissance of interest owing to the development of antihypertensive drugs which interact with 5-HT-receptors. These drugs, like ketanserin, urapidil and flesinoxan are used as tools to study the role of 5-HT and its receptors in hypertension. 2. The following arguments would plead in favour of a certain role of 5-HT and 5-HT-receptors in the pathogenesis and maintenance of hypertension: hyperresponsiveness of blood vessels from hypertensive patients and animals to 5-HT-induced constriction; the antihypertensive/vasodilator activity of the 5-HT2-receptor antagonist ketanserin; enhanced sensitivity of platelets from hypertensives to 5-HT. 3. However, at least as many arguments would deny a role of peripheral 5-HT in hypertension, like for instance: the fact that 5-HT is not a generally accepted pressor agent, whereas its concentration in the circulating blood is subthreshold; the hyperresponsiveness of vessels from hypertensives is not specific for 5-HT; the elevated local concentration of 5-HT released by platelets is mainly limited to the microcirculation; the 5-HT2-receptor antagonist ketanserin is the only agent of this type which lowers blood pressure, other 5-HT2-receptor blockers like ritanserin and LY 53587 being inactive. 4.

These observations are documented for melanomas but not for benign naevi. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which both melanomas and suspected excised naevi were included. The main objectives were to (a) analyse the value of the anamnestic predictors for melanoma versus non-melanoma and (b) calculate the influence of age on the most significant anamnestic predictors. In order to reach these objectives, we prospectively collected data on symptoms (pruritus, anxiety) and signs (de novo appearance, dynamic changes and bleeding) described by patients undergoing the excision of lesions clinically diagnosed as melanocytic and considered as suspicious by 46 Belgian dermatologists. Among 1865 lesions, dynamic changes and de novo appearance were significant predictors for melanoma versus non-melanoma diagnosis in all patients and patients older than 50, respectively. More precisely, dynamic changes and de novo appearance occurred to be strong predictors for melanoma diagnosis in patients greater than 41.5 and greater than 44.5 years, respectively. Pruritus was not significant for melanoma diagnosis. As a conclusion, when mid-age or older patients observe melanocytic lesions as recently changed or newly appeared, such lesions should be considered more carefully than when observed by young patients.",,Isabelle Tromme;Laurine Sacré;Fatima Hammouch;Pauline Richez;Jean-Marie Degryse;Niko Speybroeck,melanoma

We assessed the surplus value of performing the SN procedure in melanoma patients who underwent regional nodal surgery. The SN procedure was performed in 348 patients with melanomas who were referred to our institute between 1993 and 1999. The localisations of the melanomas with the corresponding SNs were meticulously recorded on drawings of the human body and grouped according to the conventional descriptions. Predictability of lymph drainage was defined as the percentage of melanomas whose draining pattern was to the ipsilateral nearest basin, without simultaneous drainage to other basins or to an interval node. In all patients the SN procedure visualised at least one SN. We found 410 lymphatic basins in 347 patients. These basins included basins that could not have been predicted by the conventional clinical descriptions, such as multiple basins and contralateral drainage sites. For the head/neck region, SNs could be found in any of the basins described in the literature. The trunk's drainage predictability depended strongly on the melanoma localisation, ranging from 0% in the midline to 92% in one of the upper quadrants. The lower extremities had a high predictability of almost 100%, and predictability of drainage for the upper extremities ranged from 77% to 100%. In total, 34% of the patients had a cutaneous lymphatic drainage that was unpredictable, either totally or partially.

Besides, the absence of well-established laboratories at remote sites and low-resourced environments can contribute to a silent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These reasons compel the need to accommodate point-of-care testing for COVID-19 that meets the ASSURED criteria (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free, and deliverable). This study assessed the agreement and accuracy of the portable Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 system against the gold standard tests. Nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs were used. Of the 192 samples tested using the Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 system, the results from 189 samples (98.4%) were in agreement with the reference standard-of-care RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. The portable system generated simultaneous results for nine samples in 80 min with high positive and negative percent agreements of 99.0% and 97.8%, respectively. We performed separate testing in a sealed glove box, offering complete biosafety containment. Thus, the Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 system can help decentralize COVID-19 testing and offer rapid test results for patients in remote and low-resourced settings.",Biomeme; COVID-19; RT-PCR; point-of-care; portable.,Hosam M Zowawi;Thamer H Alenazi;Waleed S AlOmaim;Ahmad Wazzan;Abdullah Alsufayan;Rihab A Hasanain;Omar S Aldibasi;Sahar Althawadi;Sarah A Altamimi;Maysoon Mutabagani;Maha Alamri;Reem S Almaghrabi;Hail M Al-Abdely;Ziad A Memish;Saleh A Alqahtani,covid-19

However, GGOs are also seen in other acute lung diseases, thus making challenging the differential diagnosis. To this aim, we investigated the performance of a radiomics-based machine learning method to discriminate GGOs due to COVID-19 from those due to other acute lung diseases. Two sets of patients were included: a first set of 28 patients (COVID) diagnosed with COVID-19 infection confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between March and April 2020 having (a) baseline HRCT at hospital admission and (b) predominant GGOs pattern on HRCT; a second set of 30 patients (nCOVID) showing (a) predominant GGOs pattern on HRCT performed between August 2019 and April 2020 and (b) availability of final diagnosis. Two readers independently segmented GGOs on HRCTs using a semi-automated approach, and radiomics features were extracted using a standard open source software (PyRadiomics). Partial least square (PLS) regression was used as the multivariate machine-learning algorithm. A leave-one-out nested cross-validation was implemented. PLS β-weights of radiomics features, including the 5% features with the largest β-weights in magnitude (top 5%), were obtained. The diagnostic performance of the radiomics model was assessed through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The Youden's test assessed sensitivity and specificity of the classification. A null hypothesis probability threshold of 5% was chosen (p < 0.05). The predictive model delivered an AUC of 0.868 (Youden's index = 0.68, sensitivity = 93%, specificity 75%, p = 4.2 × 10-7). Of the seven features included in the top 5% features, five were texture-related. A radiomics-based machine learning signature showed the potential to accurately differentiate GGOs due to COVID-19 pneumonia from those due to other acute lung diseases. Most of the discriminant radiomics features were texture-related.

The aim of this study was to confirm, using two other techniques, whether hypertension is associated with hypoalgesia in humans. In 77 untreated essential hypertensive outpatients, 37 normotensive outpatients and 27 normotensive volunteers subjective cutaneous sensitivity was assessed by an electrical stimulator. Thirty-three measurements were repeated after one month. In addition, in eight normotensive volunteers and eight hypertensives the thresholds of the polysynaptic components R2 and R3 of the blink reflex to electrical stimulation of the supraorbitalis nerve were evaluated. Tooth pulp stimulation was done in 85 of the subjects who measured cutaneous sensitivity and in all of the blink reflex study. Cutaneous perceptive, pain and tolerance thresholds were significantly higher in the hypertensives compared with both normotensive groups, with no significant difference between these two. The results were identical when age and sex-matched subgroups were compared and a high reproducibility was found for all three parameters. Similar findings were obtained for the tooth pulp thresholds and highly statistically significant correlations were found between cutaneous and tooth pulp sensitivity and between these indices and blood pressure. The thresholds of R2 and R3 were also significantly higher in the hypertensives and a significant correlation was found between R3 threshold and diastolic pressure.

The present study was performed to investigate the effects of NPWT on the volume of the intra-thoracic organs, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in a porcine sternotomy wound model. Six pigs underwent median sternotomy followed by NPWT at -75, -125 and -175 mmHg. Six pigs were not sternotomised. MR images covering the thorax and heart were acquired. The volumes of the thoracic cavity, lungs, wound fluid and heart were then determined. The volumes of the thoracic cavity and intra-thoracic organs increased after sternotomy and decreased upon NPWT application. The total heart volume variation, which is inversely related to cardiac pumping efficiency, was higher after sternotomy and decreased during NPWT. NPWT did not result in the evacuation of wound fluid from the bottom of the wound. NPWT largely closes and restores the thoracic cavity. Cardiac pumping efficiency returns to pre-sternotomy levels during NPWT. This may contribute to the clinical benefits of NPWT over open-chest care, including the stabilizing effects and the reduced need for mechanical ventilation.",,Christian Torbrand;Martin Ugander;Henrik Engblom;Göran K Olivecrona;Olof Gålne;Håkan Arheden;Richard Ingemansson;Malin Malmsjö,chest

Twenty-eight patients had a chest tube and mediastinal drainage tube. Thirty-four patients had only a mediastinal drainage tube through the intercostal space. The remaining 30 patients had a single mediastinal drainage tube in the thoracic and abdominal cavity through the abdominal wall. The complication rates and pain scores for each of the groups were compared. The statistical calculations were performed using SPSS 17.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The quantitative data among the groups were compared using 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U and Fisher exact tests were used for qualitative data analysis.There were no significant differences in the anastomotic leak rates, postoperative days and total complication rates (P = .861). The lowest visual analog scale (VAS) scores of the drainage tubes were observed in the group with a single mediastinal drain through the abdominal wall (P <.001).The results of this study suggested that a single mediastinal drainage tube in the thoracic and abdominal cavity after MIE may be safe and efficient.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34004465/,Diagnosis by forensic autopsy of cannula malposition resulting in fatal tension pneumothorax after attempted percutaneous tracheostomy: A short communication,"Percutaneous tracheostomy is commonly performed in the emergency department or intensive care unit to secure the airways of patients. This procedure is associated with a low incidence of complications; however, some of them, such as iatrogenic pneumothorax, can be fatal. Pneumothorax after percutaneous tracheostomy is most often caused by perforation of the tracheal wall or malposition of the cannula. A woman in her 80s was referred to the emergency department owing to persistent and prolonged coughing. Having speculated that she had acute epiglottitis, and having failed to achieve oral tracheal intubation, the physician performed a percutaneous tracheostomy to secure her airway. However, progressive percutaneous emphysema developed immediately thereafter, and the patient died shortly. Postmortem computed tomography showed bilateral pneumothorax. Forensic autopsy revealed that the tracheostomy cannula had failed to reach the trachea and was erroneously inserted into the right thoracic cavity via peritracheal route. Thus, it was determined that the patient's death was attributable to tension pneumothorax caused by cannula malposition during attempted tracheostomy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first forensic autopsy case report on fatal tension pneumothorax caused by attempted percutaneous tracheostomy.",Autopsy; Forensic science; Pneumothorax; Tracheostomy.,Shuheng Wen;Kana Unuma;Ryo Watanabe;Koichi Uemura,chest

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14724537/,[Molecular markers associated to prognosis of melanoma],"Melanoma prognosis is based on histological criteria such as tumor thickness (measured by Breslow index), level of invasion (Clarck's level), presence of ulceration and number of mitoses per mm2. However, these parameters do not provide a precise prognosis in all cases: thin melanomas may develop metastases and thick melanomas may remain focalized for many years. For these reasons, the search for other prognostic factors is still ongoing. Many molecules play a part in the invasiveness and metastatic dissemination of melanoma have now been identified. Expression of these molecules has been studied in primary melanoma and correlated with prognosis. An increase in the number of cells positive for Ki67 (detected by Mib1), cycline A, cycline D, p35, MMp-2, beta1 and beta3 integrins, osteonectin, the presence of an intense inflammatory infiltrate and capillary invasion are considered as factors of poor prognosis as well as the decrease in p16, p27, Melan A and nm23. The significance of CD44 modifications is still controversial. Only a small number of these different proteins has a prognostic value independent of tumor thickness.

Type III-A CRISPR-Cas system is a multi-component and multipronged immune effector, activated by viral RNA that previously has not been repurposed for disease detection owing in part to the complex enzyme reconstitution process and functionality. Here, we describe the construction and application of a virus detection method, based on an in vivo-reconstituted Type III-A CRISPR-Cas system. This system harnesses both RNA- and transcription-activated dual nucleic acid cleavage activities as well as internal signal amplification that allow virus detection with high sensitivity and at multiple settings. We demonstrate the use of the Type III-A system-based method in detection of SARS-CoV-2 that reached 2000 copies/μl sensitivity in amplification-free and 60 copies/μl sensitivity via isothermal amplification within 30 min and diagnosed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients in both settings.

The COVID-19 pandemic was heralded by the 2003 SARS epidemic which led to the discovery of human and civet SARS-CoV-1, bat SARS-related-CoVs, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related bat CoV HKU4 and HKU5, and other novel animal coronaviruses. The suspected animal-to-human jumping of 4 betacoronaviruses including the human coronaviruses OC43(1890), SARS-CoV-1(2003), MERS-CoV(2012), and SARS-CoV-2(2019) indicates their significant pandemic potential. The presence of a large reservoir of coronaviruses in bats and other wild mammals, culture of mixing and selling them in urban markets with suboptimal hygiene, habit of eating exotic mammals in highly populated areas, and the rapid and frequent air travels from these areas are perfect ingredients for brewing rapidly exploding epidemics.

We performed a series of measurements of DBH in fifty-seven normotensive and fifty hypertensive black and white men in order (1) to compare DBH to selected blood pressure patterns and (2) to evalutate the influence of salt intake, posture and race on plasma DBH. Plasma DBH, measured on unrestricted salt intake with subjects supine, was 42 +/- 4 Units/L in white normotensives, greater (P less than 0.05) than black normotensives (26 +/- 6 Units/L). White hypertensives had greater plasma concentrations of DBH than black (35 +/- 3 VS. 24 +/- 5, P less than 0.05). Normotensives did not differ from hypertensives. Dietary salt restriction and upright ambulation increased plasma DBH activity in hypertensives. Although DBH did not correlate directly with blood pressure, high DBH values were associated with lability of blood pressure in hypertensives but not in normotensives. There are two possible explanations for our results: (1) multiple factors influence plasma DBH activity and plasma levels reflect more than adrenergic function, or (2) essential hypertension is a multifactorial disease and excess sympathetic neuronal activity alone is not sufficient to produce sustained hypertension.",,S B Levy;R F Frigon;R A Stone,hypertension

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29753503/,Novel esophageal reconstruction technique via transmediastinal route from posterior to anterior mediastinum after esophagectomy,"Background: The incidence of metachronous esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) after head and neck cancer (HNC) and in elderly patients has increased. Both elderly ESCC patients and ESCC patients after HNC surgery are at potential risk for dysphagia, and for the latter, surgery in the neck is difficult. An intrathoracic anastomosis that bypasses the cervical procedure is preferable to preserve swallowing function and reduce surgical risk. In gastrectomized patients, because the stomach cannot be used as a substitute, securing graft blood supply is critical, but microvascular anastomosis cannot be easily added in procedures for intrathoracic posterior mediastinal reconstruction. Thus, we have developed a novel technique for esophageal reconstruction in gastrectomized patients who are elderly or who had undergone HNC surgery, enabling concomitant intrathoracic anastomosis and microvascular anastomosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness and safety of this technique.",esophageal reconstruction; intrathoracic anastomosis; microvascular anastomosis.,Takushi Yasuda;Osamu Shiraishi;Mitsuru Iwama;Tomoki Makino;Hiroaki Kato;Yutaka Kimura,chest

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1687447/,Hypertension in African Americans: evaluation and treatment issues,"The evaluation and treatment of hypertension in the African-American patient with an elevated blood pressure presents a diagnostic challenge. We are less able to rely on young age and resistance to treatment as indications for more extensive evaluation of secondary causes of hypertension; thus, greater reliance on history, physical examination, and clinical judgment is required if we are to identify potentially treatable causes. The treatment of hypertension in the African-American patient also presents a therapeutic challenge. Thiazide diuretics remain the drugs of first choice for treating hypertension in the African-American hypertensive. The calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are attractive alternatives to thiazides in patients uncontrolled by or intolerant of thiazides or who have specific indications for these agents (eg, angina, severe diastolic dysfunction). Beta-blockers should not be denied to African-American hypertensives if indications for their use exist. Although beta-blockers may be less effective as monotherapy, 50% of African-American hypertensives can be so controlled. Resistance to beta-blockers may be eliminated by administering them with a diuretic. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), like CCBs, are well tolerated, but also lack long-term primary prevention data. As is the case with beta-blockers, ACEIs are less effective in African-American hypertensives when used as monotherapy. ACEIs have particular value in therapy for African-American hypertensives with concomitant congestive heart failure and may protect against progression of diabetic nephropathy. Finally, all hypertensives, especially African-American hypertensives, should have access to treatment prior to the development of end organ damage.

Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, a known consequence of hypertension, is associated with an excess mortality independent of other known cardiovascular risk factors. Recently, LV hypertrophy accompanying hypertension has been associated with ominous ventricular arrhythmias. However, it does not necessarily follow that regression of LV hypertrophy will reduce this increased mortality. Diastolic dysfunction, manifested by reduced ventricular distensibility of the hypertrophying left ventricle, appears to be an early characteristic of the hypertensive heart since echocardiographic techniques have demonstrated diastolic filling abnormalities in untreated essential hypertensives even before significant LV hypertrophy appears. Not all antihypertensive agents diminish LV mass and improve diastolic dysfunction. Certain sympatholytic agents, calcium antagonists, beta-adrenergic blockers, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear to diminish LV hypertrophy. However, future studies are needed to determine if these agents that appear to reverse findings of LV hypertrophy and improve diastolic dysfunction will also reduce risk of coronary artery disease and related events.",,D J DiPette;E D Frohlich,hypertension

Another key point of chest tube management is that a water seal is considered to be superior to suction for most air leaks. Nowadays, the most common pleural drainage device attached to the chest tube is the three-bottle system. An electronic chest drainage system has been developed that is effective in standardizing the postoperative management of chest tubes. More liberal use of digital drainage devices in the postoperative management of the pleural space is warranted.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23009260/,Pleural function and lymphatics,"The pleural space plays an important role in respiratory function as the negative intrapleural pressure regimen ensures lung expansion and in the mean time maintains the tight mechanical coupling between the lung and the chest wall. The efficiency of the lung-chest wall coupling depends upon pleural liquid volume, which in turn reflects the balance between the filtration of fluid into and its egress out of the cavity. While filtration occurs through a single mechanism passively driving fluid from the interstitium of the parietal pleura into the cavity, several mechanisms may co-operate to remove pleural fluid. Among these, the pleural lymphatic system emerges as the most important one in quantitative terms and the only one able to cope with variable pleural fluid volume and drainage requirements. In this review, we present a detailed account of the actual knowledge on: (a) the complex morphology of the pleural lymphatic system, (b) the mechanism supporting pleural lymph formation and propulsion, (c) the dependence of pleural lymphatic function upon local tissue mechanics and (d) the effect of lymphatic inefficiency in the development of clinically severe pleural and, more in general, respiratory pathologies.",,D Negrini;A Moriondo,chest

In this study, four rapid methods (ACE2-RBD inhibition assay, S1-IgG detection, RBD-IgG detection, and N-IgG detection) were established and evaluated based on chemiluminescence technology. For the first time, a broadly neutralizing antibody with high affinity was used as a standard for the quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies in human sera. Sera from COVID-19 convalescent patients (N = 119), vaccinated donors (N = 86), and healthy donors (N = 299) confirmed by microneutralization test (MNT) were used to evaluate the above methods. The result showed that the ACE2-RBD inhibition assay calculated with either ACE2-RBD binding inhibition percentage rate or ACE2-RBD inhibiting antibody concentration were strongly correlated with MNT (r ≥ 0.78, p < 0.0001) and also highly consistent with MNT (Kappa Value ≥ 0.94, p < 0.01).

There was no correlation between individual values of BP and saline consumption in DI females with hypertension. However, individual BP values correlated with the urinary Na+/K+ ratio measured in the course of 24 h of water deprivation, due to age-dependent sodium excretion the values of which were highest in the UNX 25 group. Hydronephrosis was present in all DI rats with manifest hypertension. In hypertensive animals, BP values, Na+/K+ ratio and the frequency of hydronephrosis exhibited the same age dependence.

In addition, we also compared clinical features of patients with true or white-coat-resistant hypertension. In December 2009, we identified 68 045 treated patients with complete information for this analysis. Among them, 8295 (12.2% of the database) had resistant hypertension (office blood pressure ≥140 and/or 90 mm Hg while being treated with ≥3 antihypertensive drugs, 1 of them being a diuretic). After ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, 62.5% of patients were classified as true resistant hypertensives, the remaining 37.5% having white-coat resistance. The former group was younger, more frequently men, with a longer duration of hypertension and a worse cardiovascular risk profile. The group included larger proportions of smokers, diabetics, target organ damage (including left ventricular hypertrophy, impaired renal function, and microalbuminuria), and documented cardiovascular disease. Moreover, true resistant hypertensives exhibited in a greater proportion a riser pattern (22% versus 18%; P<0.001). In conclusion, this study first reports the prevalence of resistant hypertension in a large cohort of patients in usual daily practice. Resistant hypertension is present in 12% of the treated hypertensive population, but among them more than one third have normal ambulatory blood pressure. A worse risk profile is associated with true resistant hypertension, but this association is weak, thus making it necessary to assess ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for a correct diagnosis and management.",,Alejandro de la Sierra;Julián Segura;José R Banegas;Manuel Gorostidi;Juan J de la Cruz;Pedro Armario;Anna Oliveras;Luis M Ruilope,hypertension
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9411584/,[Arterial hypertension and exercise],"Both dynamic and static exercise increase blood pressure in normotensive and hypertensive patients, but the change varies among these two main forms of exercise. The validity of the blood pressure response to acute exercise as a predictor for the future development of hypertension in normotensives, or of the degree of target organ damage in hypertensives is still not clear. This acute response could be an independent predictor of mortality or cardiovascular events in the normotensives. The postexercise hypotension could work as a beneficial mechanism to reduce the reduce the rise in pressure that occurs with time. While epidemiological studies suggest an inverse relationship between physical activity or fitness and blood pressure, longitudinal studies seem to confirm the hypotensive effect of dynamic aerobic training. Though possibly in a lesser degree, strength training has also been proved to be effective. Among the responsible mechanisms, a decrease in sympathetic nerve activity is most likely involved. Hypertension seems to be also associated with a lower maximal capacity, that could be even more adversely affected by the action of certain antihypertensive drugs such as diuretics or beta-blockers.

The mechanism of the antidiuretic effect of hydrochlorothiazide in diabetes insipidus was studied in anaesthetized Brattleboro rats with the hereditary hypothalamic form of the disease. 2. The antidiuresis caused by acute administration of hydrochlorothiazide followed an increase in sodium excretion and was associated with a significant fall in the plasma sodium concentration. There were concomitant falls in effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate. 3. When sodium depletion was prevented by adjusting the infusion of sodium chloride, the falls in plasma sodium concentration, effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate were abolished. Under these circumstances there was an increase in urine volume, which suggests that hydrochlorothiazide may inhibit fractional fluid reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule. 4. The results indicate that the antidiuresis caused by hydrochlorothiazide in diabetes insipidus results, at least in part, from falls in effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate.

More than 20 years of follow-up show that responders to IL-2 can be cured of their melanoma. Therefore, we recommend high-dose IL-2 as first line therapy for patients with excellent functional status and normal cardiopulmonary reserve regardless of their BRAF mutation status. We use ipilimumab, which can induce durable tumor regressions and improved survival, as initial therapy for patients who refuse or are not candidates for IL-2, also regardless of their BRAF mutation status. Ipilimumab can be used as salvage therapy for patients with advanced disease after IL-2 or vemurafenib. Targeted therapies such as vemurafenib or imatinib can be offered to patients whose melanomas express the BRAF V600E or C-Kit mutations. Vemurafenib is particularly useful for patients whose disease is progressing rapidly, as clinical improvement can be obtained within days of starting therapy and response rates may be as high as 70 %. The major reason we do not recommend vemurafenib as first line treatment in all patients whose tumors have BRAF mutations is the short median duration of response of approximately 7 months. Enrollment in a clinical trial should always be considered for patients with metastatic melanoma. The clinical trial focus has changed from finding any agent with activity in melanoma, to overcoming mechanisms of resistance and enhancing the immunomodulatory activity of these new agents that confer therapeutic benefit. Selected patients can benefit from surgical resection or radiation to manage oligometastatic disease.",,Brendan D Curti;Walter J Urba,melanoma

Each group was also evaluated, separating those with low plasma renin activity from the total sample. The sample group was made up of 75 young males; 31 hypertensives (mean age 22.7 +/- 2.5 years), 28 normotensives with hypertensive heredity (normotensives F+) (mean age 22.2 +/- 1.9 years) and 16 normotensives (mean age 22.0 +/- 2.1 years). An inverse correlation between ANF and PRA was shown in all groups. In hypertensives, ANF was inversely correlated with uKK (r = -0.664, P less than .0001). Plasma ANF (P less than .012) and DLS (P less than .0001) were higher in hypertensives than in normotensives, while uKK excretion was lower (P less than .0001). Plasma levels of DLS were higher in F+ normotensives than in normotensives (P less than .003). Low renin hypertensives showed the lowest uKK excretion (P less than .0001 v normal-high renin hypertensives). Furthermore, low renin hypertensives showed the highest plasma levels of ANF (P less than .0001 v normal high renin hypertensives) and DLS (P less than .012 v normal-high renin hypertensives). Plasma ANF (P less than .0001) was higher, while uKK was lower (P less than .045) in low renin F+ normotensives than in normal-high renin ones.

A subsequent study using eggs of genotype G1 from humans and G3 from pigs to infect pigs and mice indicated that there is a significant difference in the ability to infect and establish as larvae in mice and as adults in pigs between the two genotypes. Extending previous investigations, the present study investigated whether there are differences in development as designated by egg hatching, larvae migration and distribution in the mice between the Ascaris strains with known genotypes. Ascaris eggs of genotypes G1 (predominating in human-derived worms) and G3 (predominating in pig-derived worms) were used to infect C57BL/6 mice orally. Eggs/larvae were examined from the small and large intestines, thoracic and abdominal cavities, peripheral blood, livers and lungs at intervals of 2h until 12h post-infection, then periodically until 34 days of infection. Results showed distinct differences in egg hatching (the timing and location of hatching, and the numbers hatched), and in larvae migration and distribution (the means and constituent ratios, the time of peak recovery, and larvae reappearing in intestines) between the two strains. The results can explain the findings of significantly higher larval recovery of genotype G1 than G3 in the mice, and may shed some enlightenment to understand the difference in host affiliation of Ascaris of different genotypes.",,Weidong Peng;Keng Yuan;Guohua Peng;Lin Qiu;Zhifang Dai;Fang Yuan;Yinying Hu;Ningyan Hu,chest

Its blocking stimulates the immune response to tumor antigens. Ocular melanomas represent 3-4% of the total melanomas and have metastatic potential, especially to the liver but also to the lungs, skin, and bones. In the case of metastatic melanoma, immunotherapy has a unique role due to the lower frequencies of BRAF mutation in choroidal melanomas and consecutive exclusion from treatment with specific BRAF tyrosine kinase inhibitors. A retrospective observational study was performed in 42 patients who received immunotherapy (IT) with nivolumab for cutaneous and ocular metastatic melanomas, aimed at highlighting the association between the topography of metastases and the duration of immunotherapy until progressive disease. The results indicated the presence of liver metastases as a negative predictive factor for IT duration in patients with melanoma and the presence of lymphatic metastases as a predictive factor for longer IT in patients with melanoma under 65 years old.",melanoma; metastases; nivolumab; ocular.,Sorin Săftescu;Mihnea Munteanu;Dorel Popovici;Radu Dragomir;Alina Gabriela Negru;Patricia Cristina Pac;Șerban Mircea Negru,melanoma

This suggests that long-term inability to take a deep breath in developing children may result in underdevelopment of the upper chest wall. In addition, a rapid and paradoxical breathing pattern is frequently observed in children with severe cerebral palsy (CP), which often corresponds to the underdevelopment of the upper chest wall. The present study is designed to evaluate the ratio of the upper to lower chest wall in children with severe spastic quadriplegic CP, compared with normal children. We compared normal children with children that had spastic quadriplegic CP who did not have kyphosis or scoliosis. Test subjects were matched in terms of age, height, and weight. The diameters of upper chest (D(apex)) and of lower chest (D(base)) were measured on the anteroposterior (AP) view of a chest X-ray and the D(apex) to D(base) ratio was calculated. In selected cases the forced vital capacity (FVC) was measured using a Wright Respirometer. The D(apex) to D(base) ratio was significantly lower in the CP group than in the control group (p < 0.001). The ratio increased linearly with age (p < 0.001) in both CP (R = 0.372) and control groups (R = 0.477).

Intracellular Mg2+ measurements were performed in lymphocytes of 18 untreated normotensive and 19 untreated essential hypertensive patients. Mg2+ content was referred to lymphocytic protein, which was determined according to Bradford's method. Mg2+ measurements were performed by atomic absorption spectroscopy using a Video 12 apparatus from Thermo Electron Instrumentation Laboratory, Andover, MA, USA. The results show that in patients with essential hypertension, total intralymphocytic Mg2+ content is significantly lower (0.07 +/- 0.05 mmol/g lymphocytic protein, mean +/- s.d.) as compared to controls (0.11 +/- 0.04 mmol/g lymphocytic protein, mean +/- s.d., P < 0.05). Free intracellular Mg2+ content was measured in lymphocytes by the fluorescent indicator mag-fura-II, showing no significant difference in normotensives and hypertensives (0.30 +/- 0.16 vs 0.38 +/- 0.17 mmol/l). In platelets free intracellular Mg2+ concentrations were not found of significant difference in normotensive and hypertensive patients (0.52 +/- 0.23 vs 0.47 +/- 0.27 mmol/l) using mag-fura-II. In plasma Mg2+ concentrations there was no significant difference in the normotensive and hypertensive group (0.92 +/- 0.07 vs 0.88 to 0.07 mmol/l). There was no correlation between plasma, free or total cellular magnesium concentrations in each group. Furthermore this method also seems suitable for routine measurements of total intracellular Mg2+ concentrations in even larger groups of patients in comparison with fluorescent indicator measurements like mag-fura-II. Lowered total intracellular Mg2+ concentrations in a subgroup of primary hypertension may contribute to the development of this disorder, perhaps due to different buffering systems.",,K Kisters;M Tepel;C Spieker;K H Dietl;M Barenbrock;K H Rahn;W Zidek,hypertension

Diagnostic tests for covid-19 fall into two main categories: molecular tests that detect viral RNA, and serological tests that detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a molecular test, has become the gold standard for diagnosis of covid-19; however, this test has many limitations that include potential false negative results, changes in diagnostic accuracy over the disease course, and precarious availability of test materials. Serological tests have generated substantial interest as an alternative or complement to RT-PCR and other Nucleic acid tests in the diagnosis of acute infection, as some might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care. A clear advantage of these tests over RT-PCR is that they can identify individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, even if they never underwent testing while acutely ill. Many serological tests for covid-19 have become available in a short period, including some marketed for use as rapid, point-of-care tests.

Her case was complicated by non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with severe insulin resistance, central diabetes insipidus, and hyposecretion of GH. Most patients with AHO are found in a family of pseudohypoparathyroidism type-Ia and have a heterozygous mutation that inactivates the alpha-subunit of Gs (Gs alpha), the stimulatory regulator of adenylyl cyclase. Some sporadic cases occur in which patients with phenotype similar to AHO have a deletion of chromosome 2q37. However, in this patient, both the Gs alpha gene structure and the biological activity were normal.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28859850/,"IL-4/5 signalling plays an important role during Litomosoides sigmodontis infection, influencing both immune system regulation and tissue pathology in the thoracic cavity","Approximately 100 million people suffer from filarial diseases including lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis), onchocerciasis (river blindness) and loiasis. These diseases are amongst the most devastating of the neglected tropical diseases in terms of social and economic impact. Moreover, many infection-induced immune mechanisms in the host, their relationship to disease-related symptoms and the development of pathology within the site of infection remain unclear. To improve on current drug therapies or vaccines, further studies are necessary to decipher the mechanisms behind filaria-driven immune responses and pathology development, and thus the rodent model of Litomosoides sigmodontis can be used to unravel host-filaria interactions. Interestingly, BALB/c mice develop a patent state (release of microfilariae, the transmission life-stage, into the periphery) when exposed to L. sigmodontis. Thus, using this model, we determined levels of host inflammation and pathology development during a L. sigmodontis infection in vivo for the first known time. Our study reveals that after 30days p.i., inflammation and pathology began to develop in infected wild type BALB/c mice between the lung and diaphragm, close to the site of infection - the thoracic cavity. Interestingly, infected IL-4Rα/IL-5-/- BALB/c mice had accentuated inflammation of the pleural lung and pleural diaphragm, and higher parasite burdens. Corresponding to the pleural inflammation, levels of IP-10, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MIP-2 and RANTES were significantly elevated in the thoracic cavity fluid of infected IL-4Rα/IL-5-/- mice compared with wild type controls. Moreover, upon L. sigmodontis antigen stimulation, IFN-γ and IL-17A secretions by cells isolated from draining lymph nodes of IL-4Rα/IL-5-/- mice were significantly elevated, whereas secretion of IL-5, IL-13 and IL-10 was reduced. Elevated filaria-specific IFN-γ secretion was also observed in spleen-derived CD4+ T cell co-cultures from IL-4Rα/IL-5-/- mice. In summary, this study unravels the essential role of IL-4/IL-5 signalling in controlling immunity against filarial infections and demonstrates the requirement of this pathway for the host to control ensuing pathology and inflammation.",Diaphragm; IL-4Rα/IL-5(−/−); Immune regulation; Litomosoides sigmodontis; Lung; Pathology; Thoracic cavity.,Manuel Ritter;Ruth S Tamadaho;Judith Feid;Wenzel Vogel;Katharina Wiszniewsky;Sven Perner;Achim Hoerauf;Laura E Layland,chest

Molecular diagnosis, using real time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the common standard method; however, it is not widely available in Indonesia and requires a high standard laboratory. Rapid, point-of-care antibody testing has been widely used as an alternative; however, interpretation of the results is not simple and now it is no longer used by the Indonesian government as a screening test for people travelling between locations. Thus, the rapid antigen detection test (Ag-RDT) is used by the Indonesian government as a screening test for travellers. As a result, many people buy the kit online and perform self-Ag-RDT at home. This raises the question of how safe and accurate it is to perform self-Ag-RDT at home. Before a test is applied, it is suggested to research its sensitivity and specificity, as compared to gold standard, and its limitations.

We have researched, by the KHI square (chi 2) statistical test, a relation between the reaction intensity, its cutaneous location, and the tumor type. The reaction intensity is not statistically linked with the tumor type. The cutaneous location of the reaction is statistically more heterogeneous in malignant melanoma than in benign or dysplastic melanocytic lesions. Among the dysplastic nevus, 6 cases (38%), of the familial type, have an heterogeneous reaction looking like the malignant melanoma's one. However, there is no significant difference, in the reaction pattern, between dysplastic and benign lesions. Nevertheless some dysplastic nevus seems to have a phenotypic expression for HMB-45 midway between benign and malignant melanocytic lesion, that will be interesting to precise. Otherwise, the simple use and the staining of HMB-45 monoclonal antibody are of great interest to assess the depth of primary cutaneous melanoma and to diagnose secondary melanoma.

Implications for melanoma metastasis,"The ultrastructural localization of an amorphous matrix to the interface between microvessel endothelium and tumor cells has been recently reported in a series of melanomas. Laminin expression as documented by immunohistochemistry was localized to microvessels in melanomas showing the amorphous matrix. In order to identify more precisely the type of laminin present in this amorphous material, immunostaining was carried out on cryostat sections from 16 human melanoma specimens. Four murine monoclonal antibodies directed against the alpha-3, beta-2, beta-3 and gamma-2 laminin chains were employed. In the melanomas studied, alpha3, beta3 and gamma2 laminin chains showed only minimal focal vascular positivity. In contrast, the beta2 (16/16 cases) laminin chain exhibited a consistent positivity in an angiocentric pattern about tumor microvessels. In all melanomas, some tumor cells seemed to spread along the abluminal surface of the small vessels, exhibiting a pericytic location, particularly along the intratumoral projections formed by the beta2 laminin chain. Given the role of laminin in migration and tumor progression, the results suggest a role of the beta2 laminin chain in melanoma spread, promoting tumor migration along the abluminal surface of vessel, a phenomenon which has been termed extra-vascular migratory metastasis.",,C Lugassy;A Shahsafaei;P Bonitz;K J Busam;R L Barnhill,melanoma

Samples from pharyngeal or/and anal swabs were subjected to reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 within 12 h of patient admission; a second RT-PCR test was done 24 h after the first test. RESULTS Of the 159 patients, 151 patients had epidemiological histories, 14 patients had cluster onset, and 8 patients had no epidemiological history but had symptoms similar to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The most common symptom was fever (n=125), followed by respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. A 7-year-old boy in a cluster family from Wuhan was confirmed with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection with ground-glass opacity shadows on his lung computed tomography scan, and his swab RT-PCR test had not turned negative until day 19 of his hospitalization.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7912651/,"[Arterial hypertension, stress, and beta-blockers]","There is strong circumstantial evidence supporting the hypothesis that essential arterial hypertension is associated at least initially, with an augmented sympathetic activity. The link between the sympathetic nervous system and the hypertensive state is further supported by the clinical evidence furnished by the efficacy of drugs interfering with sympathetic control. In this lecture we address the role of behavioral and mental factors, globally indicated with the word ""stress"", that may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of the hypertensive condition. At the core of this approach, there is the view that, operationally, mental stress could be conveniently substituted by some quantification of the sympathetic activity (in its continuous balance with vagal modulation). In our laboratory we employ the normalized power of the low frequency (LF, 0.1 Hz) component of the autospectra of RR interval variability as an index of sympathetic drive. In hypertensives at rest there is a prevalence of LF (as compared to the HF, high frequency, component, which is a marker of vagal activity). Additionally the responsiveness to both physical and mental stimuli is diminished. After chronic beta-adrenergic blockade, the spectral profile, and its responsiveness, returns toward normal. Furthermore the gain of baroreflex mechanisms (obtained with cross spectral analysis of RR interval and systolic arterial pressure variability) is also increased by atenolol treatment. We conclude that this approach may permit a better quantification of the role played by behavioral and mental factors in essential hypertension, and help to define individualized treatments.",,M Pagani,hypertension

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12609787/,Changes from mid-1980s to late 1990s among clinical and demographic correlates of melanoma thickness,"Tumour thickness is the most relevant prognostic factor for cutaneous melanoma. Although the increasing incidence of melanoma is currently attributable to ""thin"" lesions, the incidence rates of ""thick"" melanomas have not declined. We want to identify the clinical and demographic characteristics of patients that are associated with diagnosis of thick (> 3 mm) cutaneous melanoma and whether they had changed from mid-1980s to late-1990s. Cutaneous malignant melanomas incidence in 1985-87 and in 1995-97 were retrieved from the Tuscany Cancer Registry, central Italy. Only cases with Breslow-thickness information (182/260 in 1985-87 and 387/490 in 1995-97) were included. Thickness was categorised in < = 1 mm, 1-3 mm and > 3 mm. Thickness was evaluated for each period of time according to gender, age, histological type, site and residence. For cases diagnosed in 1995-97 the effect of such variables in predicting the risk of a thick tumour (vs. a thin one) was analysed in a logistic model. In 1985-87 patients with thick melanoma were more likely to be - with a statistically significant difference - males (38.1 % of thick tumours) than females (19.4 %), over 70 (57.7 % of thick tumour), with nodular melanoma (62.1 %) and residents far from the city of Florence (30.3 %); no differences were evidenced according to site. From 1985-87 to 1995-97 there was a global shift towards thinner melanomas. In 1995-97 nodular type and old age were the only variables significantly associated with thick melanomas when other factors were taken into account in a multivariate analysis. According to most recent data, early detection activities should be focused on older patients and on nodular histotype. Male sex and residence was no longer found to be associated with late melanoma diagnosis.",,Emanuele Crocetti;Paolo Carli,melanoma

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2267994/,Estrogen receptor status in malignant melanoma,"Estrogen receptor (ER) positivity demonstrated in malignant melanomas by histochemical and biochemical assays suggested the possibility of hormonal management and improved prognosis as for breast carcinoma patients. We studied the ER status of 5 primary and 28 metastatic malignant melanomas with a commercial immunohistochemical kit (ER-ICA monoclonal), that utilizes monoclonal anti-ER and a peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique, and by a histochemical method using fluorescein-conjugated estradiol (Fluoro-Cep Estrogen assay), on frozen sections. In addition, we conducted a biochemical assay [dextran-coated charcoal cytosolic assay (DCC)] in 16 cases. All 33 cases were ER negative by ER-ICA and Fluoro-Cep: 11 biochemical assays were negative (less than 3 fmol ER/mg protein), four were in the borderline range (3 to 10 fmol ER/mg protein), and one was positive (greater than 10 fmol ER/mg protein) at 11 fmol. The melanomas in 97% of the cases we studied were ER negative by two or three different assays. Low-level estrogen binding of MM tissues may be the result of interactions other than with Type I true ER. The low frequency of ER positivity of malignant melanomas appears to preclude the clinical use of ER status as an indicator for response to hormonal manipulation in patients with malignant melanoma.",,C Cohen;P B DeRose;W G Campbell;D C Schlosnagle;D Sgoutas,melanoma
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33649778/,Current molecular and clinical insights into uveal melanoma (Review),"Uveal melanoma (UM) represents the most prominent primary eye cancer in adults. With an incidence of approximately 5 cases per million individuals annually in the United States, UM could be considered a relatively rare cancer. The 90‑95% of UM cases arise from the choroid. Diagnosis is based mainly on a clinical examination and ancillary tests, with ocular ultrasonography being of greatest value. Differential diagnosis can prove challenging in the case of indeterminate choroidal lesions and, sometimes, monitoring for documented growth may be the proper approach. Fine needle aspiration biopsy tends to be performed with a prognostic purpose, often in combination with radiotherapy. Gene expression profiling has allowed for the grading of UMs into two classes, which feature different metastatic risks. Patients with UM require a specialized multidisciplinary management. Primary tumor treatment can be either enucleation or globe preserving. Usually, enucleation is reserved for larger tumors, while radiotherapy is preferred for small/medium melanomas. The prognosis is unfavorable due to the high mortality rate and high tendency to metastasize. Following the development of metastatic disease, the mortality rate increases to 80% within one year, due to both the absence of an effective treatment and the aggressiveness of the condition. Novel molecular studies have allowed for a better understanding of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms involved in UM biological activity, which differs compared to skin melanomas. The most commonly mutated genes are GNAQ, GNA11 and BAP1. Research in this field could help to identify effective diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as novel therapeutic targets.",uveal melanoma; staging; treatment; diagnosis; prognosis; biomarkers; epigenetics.,Matteo Fallico;Giuseppina Raciti;Antonio Longo;Michele Reibaldi;Vincenza Bonfiglio;Andrea Russo;Rosario Caltabiano;Giuseppe Gattuso;Luca Falzone;Teresio Avitabile,melanoma
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8896306/,Automated blood pressure measurement (ABPM) in the elderly,"Application and feasibility of automated ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) in the elderly are comparable to younger age groups. Major side-effects are sleep disturbances and pain during cuff-inflation. The main indications for ABPM are diagnosis and control of treatment in hypertensive patients. Further indications are the diagnosis of syncope or hypotensive disorders and the diagnostic work-up of symptoms like vertigo, dizziness and dyspnea. In hypertensives, ABPM can easily assess the ""white coat"" effect and cases of ""white coat"" hypertension (prevalence in the elderly 15-25%). The prognostic implications of ""white coat"" hypertensions remain to be determined. Recording of the total 24-h blood pressure profile with analysis of circadian blood pressure changes, the day-night difference and the early morning surge raises the possibility to assess age-specific patterns. The drop in blood pressure at night (during sleep) is usually decreased and less frequently observed in elderly hypertensives. Possible explanations include decreased daytime activity, an altered sleep pattern in the elderly and secondary forms of hypertension. So-called ""non-dippers"", with no adequate drop in night-time blood pressure, show a significant increase in cardiovascular complications. Control of treatment via ABPM can assess non-responders and cases of overtreatment, and permits a fairly objective analysis of side-effects. Episodes of transient myocardial ischemia and possible trigger mechanisms can be assessed by simultaneous application of ABPM and Holter monitoring. The insufficient control of hypertension in the majority of elderly patients and the current lower target blood pressures in the elderly call for new methods to improve the level and quality of antihypertensive treatment. Although ABPM provides a closer correlation to target organ damage than measurement of office (casual) blood pressure, and ABPM frequently improves or at least facilitates the care of elderly hypertensive patients, it remains to be determined whether ABPM can finally improve the long-term outcome of these patients.",,P Trenkwalder,hypertension

Fifteen healthy adult toco toucans (Ramphastos toco), 10 females and 5 males, average body mass of 650 g were studied. CT examination as well as right lateral and ventrodorsal radiographic examinations of the coelomic cavity were performed under chemical restraint. Heart, lungs, air sacs, trachea and syrinx were analysed. The mean values of heart length, heart width and thoracic cavity in radiographs were, respectively, 23.76 mm, 25.94 mm and 48.87 mm. In both X-rays and CT scans, the lung parenchyma had honeycomb-like pattern. The topographic areas of the anterior and posterior air sacs were visualized as dark and air-filled spaces in X-rays. On CT evaluation, the air sacs occupied a larger area in the coelomic cavity compared to X-ray. In the lateral radiographic view, the cervical part of the trachea was positioned more ventrally in the transition from cervical to thoracic regions showing a V-shaped appearance. In all CT planes was visible division of the trachea into the right and left main bronchi at the level of 3rd thoracic vertebra. The syrinx was difficult to visualize in X-rays, but on CT it was easily identified in axial slice. In conclusion, the normal features of toco toucan's heart and lower respiratory tract that were determined on X-rays and CT scans are useful to compare with sick toco toucans, as well as other bird species.",air sacs; bird; heart; imaging techniques; lung.,Jeana Pereira da Silva;Sheila Canevese Rahal;Maria Cristina Reis Castiglioni;Raphael Augusto Baldissera Gonçalves;Danuta Pulz Doiche;Anneke Moresco;Maria Jaqueline Mamprim;Luiz Carlos Vulcano,chest

We compared the new classification with the original classification to determine the effect of the changes on the prediction of outcome for the patient after enucleation. Staff pathologists had originally classified 52 of the 100 cases as spindle-cell type melanoma. Only 31 of the 100 cases were reclassified as spindle-cell types (two spindle-cell nevi and 29 spindle-cell melanomas). Tumors classified as mixed-cell type were further subdivided into groups based on the percentage and size of the epithelioid cells. Tumors formerly classified as spindle-cell type that contained small or rare epithelioid cells were reclassified as mixed-cell type. This improved the prediction of outcome for the patient.

In this direction, one appropriate alternative approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus protein at low level i.e., femtomolar (fM) is exploring plasmonic metasensor technology for COVID-19 diagnostics, which offers exquisite opportunities in advanced healthcare programs, and modern clinical diagnostics. The intrinsic merits of plasmonic metasensors stem from their capability to squeeze electromagnetic fields, simultaneously in frequency, time, and space. However, the detection of low-molecular weight biomolecules at low densities is a typical drawback of conventional metasensors that has recently been addressed using toroidal metasurface technology. This research is focused on the fabrication of a miniaturized plasmonic immunosensor based on toroidal electrodynamics concept that can sustain robustly confined plasmonic modes with ultranarrow lineshapes in the terahertz (THz) frequencies. By exciting toroidal dipole mode using our quasi-infinite metasurface and a judiciously optimized protocol based on functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) conjugated with the specific monoclonal antibody specific to spike protein (S1) of SARS-CoV-2 virus onto the metasurface, the resonance shifts for diverse concentrations of the spike protein are monitored. Possessing molecular weight around ~76 kDa allowed to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus protein with significantly low as limit of detection (LoD) was achieved as ~4.2 fM. We envisage that outcomes of this research will pave the way toward the use of toroidal metasensors as practical technologies for rapid and precise screening of SARS-CoV-2 virus carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, and spike proteins in hospitals, clinics, laboratories, and site of infection.",COVID-19 pandemic; Femtomole-level detection; SARS-CoV-2 spike protein; Terahertz plasmonic biosensors; Toroidal metasurfaces.,Arash Ahmadivand;Burak Gerislioglu;Zeinab Ramezani;Ajeet Kaushik;Pandiaraj Manickam;S Amir Ghoreishi,covid-19

Nevertheless, recent population studies have shown that awareness and management of high BP levels are far from optimal. In this study, we performed a search for publications providing frequencies of hypertension awareness, treatment and control in different populations. In men, the frequencies of awareness, antihypertensive drug treatment and BP control among all hypertensive patients varied between 23% and 93%, 5% and 89% and 5% and 87%, respectively. In women, the frequencies ranged between 28% and 97%, 6% and 97%, and 0% and 97%, respectively. The percentage of aware hypertensives who were under antihypertensive drug treatment varied between 47% and 95% in men and between 50% and 100% in women. The percentage of hypertensives who were under antihypertensive drug treatment varied between 47% and 95% in men and between 50% and 100% in women. The percentage of treated hypertensives achieving an adequate BP control varied between 29% and 95% in men and between 0% and 100% in women. Overall, women had a better awareness, treatment and control status for hypertension than men, and worse in developing countries than in industrialised countries. Hypertension awareness, treatment and control improved with time, together with the proportion of diagnosed hypertensive patients under treatment and the proportion of well controlled among treated hypertensive patients.

The total particulate matter geometric mean of 0.52 mg/m (3), however, was above 0.5 mg/m (3), the total particulate matter concentration offered as a surrogate REL in the NIOSHCriteria for a Recommended Standard for Occupational Exposure to Metalworking Fluids.[1]Of the 83 total particulate matter results that were at or above smash 0.5 mg/m (3), only 50 (60%) of the corresponding thoracic particulate matter results were at or above 0.4 mg/m (3). These data indicated a conversion factor of 1.65 between thoracic particulate matter and total particulate matter concentrations and 1.40 between thoracic extractable particulate matter and total extractable concentrations. These factors were significantly different from the 1.25 used to compare total particulate matter with thoracic particulate matter concentrations in the NIOSHCriteria Document[1](p < 0.01) and call into question the validity of a universal conversion factor. The authors conclude that thoracic particulate matter exposure assessment should be done directly.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8263894/,"Characterization of hypertensive subjects who become normotensive during three months of office BP follow-up: comparison with subjects with sustained hypertension and normotensives, and follow-up after two years","After an observation period of three months, 83% of new hypertensives (n = 84), identified in a population survey, became normotensive. Those with sustained hypertension (n = 14) were compared with 14 initially hypertensives who became normotensive and 14 normotensives, matched for age and sex, using ambulatory and exercise BP and echocardiography (both M-mode and Doppler). The initially hypertensive group (n = 11) was re-examined after two years follow-up. The 24h mean ambulatory and submaximal systolic exercise BP did not differ between sustained (139/92 and 210 mmHg) and initially hypertensives (143/95 and 217 mmHg), being significantly lower in the normotensive group (129/85 and 198 mmHg). Left ventricular mass did not differ between the initially hypertensive and the normotensive groups, being significantly higher in the sustained hypertensives. In both hypertensive groups, as compared with normotensives, the ratio between flow velocity in early and late diastole (E/A ratio) tended to be lower and the early diastolic deceleration time (DT) was significantly shorter. After two years, in the untreated initially hypertensives, office DBP had increased to hypertensive values, without change in ambulatory BP, left ventricular mass or early diastolic deceleration time. The E/A ratio had decreased to a level < 1. We conclude that the subjects who became normotensive after three months office BP follow-up have a BP load and signs of compromised left ventricular diastolic function similar to that of the sustained hypertensives, but without increased left ventricular mass.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,J T van Leeuwen;B S ten Berge;J P Hamer;T K Havinga;J F May;A J Smit;F H Schuurman;E van der Veur;K I Lie;H Wesseling,hypertension

All persons were examined in prone and standing positions, as well as during exercise. When prone and upright renograms were compared, 24% of the hypertensives demonstrated bilateral orthostatic renal dysfunction. Exercise caused the hippurate transport disturbance to increase. Fifty-seven percent of all hypertensives developed evidence of marked, bilateral, renal dysfunction during ergometric stress, so that exercise renography was shown to be a more sensitive test of the presence of transient tubular dysfunction in hypertension than the standing renogram.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17205294/,Pleural macrophages are the dominant cell population in the thoracic cavity with an inflammatory cytokine profile similar to peritoneal macrophages,"Numerous human macrophage (mphi) subpopulations with different behavior have been identified in adults. It is well known that peritoneal mphi are activated by abdominal surgery and subsequently contribute to a systemic inflammatory response that leads to immune suppression, increased morbidity and mortality. Information on the role of pleural mphi in adults is scarce and information on their role in children is lacking. We investigated the behavior of pleural versus peritoneal mphi in children and adolescents. As a first step, we compared the cellular composition of the pleural and peritoneal surface in children and adolescents. Pleural and peritoneal lavages were performed in 21 patients undergoing non-contaminated laparoscopic and thoracoscopic surgical procedures. We observed a significantly higher percentage of mphi in the pleural compared to the peritoneal cavity with less lymphocytes, a small amount of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and other cells. To further study the mphi inflammatory response, we measured the spontaneous and LPS triggered cytokine release of isolated pleural versus peritoneal mphi (IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10). The pattern of cytokine release was similar in both, pleural and peritoneal mphi. Directly after lavage, they showed a strong activation, with no difference between stimulated and non-stimulated cells. After 24 h resting, mphi of both compartments reacted to LPS with a similar significant increase in the cytokine release. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that pleural mphi represent the dominant cell population in the pleural cavity of the young. They show a similar inflammatory response as peritoneal mphi and should be considered to play a major role in the local inflammatory response to thoracic surgery.",,Akihiro Shimotakahara;Joachim F Kuebler;Gertrud Vieten;Martin L Metzelder;Claus Petersen;Benno M Ure,chest

However, even in this barely hypertensive state, 18 S rats had a 31% lower papillary plasma flow (Lilienfield method) than 22 R rats, 19.2 ml/100 g of papilla per min compared to 25.6 (P less than 0.001). When a high (8%) NaCl diet was fed for 7 days, R rats increased papillary plasma flow from 25.6 on 0.3% NaCl to 33.8 on 8% NaCl, a 32% rise (P less than 0.001). S rats increased papillary flow from 20.4 to 24.8, a 22% rise (P less than 0.05). When a high (8%) NaCl diet was fed for 4 weeks, R rats increased papillary plasma flow from 25.7 ml/100 g per min on 0.3% NaCl to 29.5 ml/100 g per min on 8% NaCl, a 15% rise (P less than 0.025). S rats increased papillary flow from 17.7 to 20.0 ml/100 g per min (not significant). S rats on 8% NaCl had a papillary flow 32% lower than R rats on 8% NaCl (P less than 0.001). BP of S rats rose to 162 mm Hg after 4 weeks on 8% NaCl; in R rats, BP did not rise at all. S rats on 0.3% NaCl have a low papillary flow even in a borderline hypertensive state. When challenged with 8% NaCl, R rats increased papillary flow, an adaptation possibly important for the natriuresis. S rats failed to achieve this same high papillary flow. Lacking this adaptation, hypertension may then conceivably occur in S rats to accomplish natriuresis through a ""pressure natriuresis"" mechanism. Papillary flow also decreased by 11% in 26 Kyoto 17-week-old spontaneously hypertensives (BP, 182 mm Hg) compared to 24 Kyoto normotensives (BP, 118 mm Hg), 29.5 vs 33.2 ml/100 g per min (P less than 0.001).

Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome are the major complications of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection can activate innate and adaptive immune responses and result in massive inflammatory responses later in the disease. These uncontrolled inflammatory responses may lead to local and systemic tissue damage. In patients with severe COVID-19, eosinopenia and lymphopenia with a severe reduction in the frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells are a common feature. COVID-19 severity hinges on the development of cytokine storm characterized by elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, IgG-, IgM- and IgA-specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in most patients, along with the viral RNA, forming the basis for assays that aid in patient diagnosis. Elucidating the immunopathological outcomes due to COVID-19 could provide potential targets for immunotherapy and are important for choosing the best clinical management by consultants. Currently, along with standard supportive care, therapeutic approaches to COVID-19 treatment involve the use of antiviral agents that interfere with the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle to prevent further viral replication and utilizing immunomodulators to dampen the immune system in order to prevent cytokine storm and tissue damage. While current therapeutic options vary in efficacy, there are several molecules that were either shown to be effective against other viruses such as HIV or show promise in vitro that could be added to the growing arsenal of agents used to control COVID-19 severity and spread.",COVID-19; acute respiratory distress syndrome; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; hyperinflammation; immunopathology.,Abubakar Umar Anka;Mohammed Ibrahim Tahir;Sharafudeen Dahiru Abubakar;Mohamed Alsabbagh;Zeineb Zian;Haleh Hamedifar;Araz Sabzevari;Gholamreza Azizi,covid-19

Molecular studies revealed the tumor contained a GNAQ mutation and four-color fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) composed of chromosome enumeration probes for 3, 7, 17 and a locus specific probe for 9p21/CDKN2A yielded a normal result (i.e. two copies per cell), favoring a primary versus metastatic melanocytic neoplasm of the CNS. We report a case in which the combination of mutational analysis and FISH aided in identifying the origin of the neoplasm.",GNA11 mutation; GNAQ mutation; melanocytoma; metastatic melanoma; primary CNS melanocytic neoplasm; urovysion.,Kristine M Cornejo;Lloyd Hutchinson;Ediz F Cosar;Thomas Smith;Keith Tomaszewicz;Karen Dresser;April Deng,melanoma

An interim evaluation],"More than 26% of Whites studied in two rural communities were found to be hypertensive during the 1979 Coronary Risk Factor Study (CORIS). At re-study during registration at the commencement of the hypertension intervention phase, hypertension could be confirmed in 72%. The mean blood pressures had decreased, and the percentages on treatment or with control of hypertension had improved by 43% and 136% respectively, indicating that screening for, and awareness of, hypertension had beneficial results. During the first 8 months of the hypertension intervention phase, 451 hypertensives were registered in the high-intensity intervention (HII) town, and 166 in the low-intensity intervention (LII) town. In both towns decreases in mean blood pressure and increases in treatment and control percentages could be demonstrated. In the HII town 80% of hypertensives were on treatment and 83% were controlled 4 - 8 months after registration, the most impressive results being achieved in the group which began treatment as a result of the intervention. A group with mild hypertension which was treated by non-pharmacological means only also improved, 66% eventually being controlled. The hypertension programme was three times more successful in the HII town, where the results suggest that hypertension in a community can be effectively controlled in the short term, using for the most part locally available health personnel and facilities.",,J E Rossouw;P L Jooste;J P Kotzé;P C Jordaan,hypertension

They were treated by VATS removal of intrathoracic foreign bodies. No complications developed postoperatively, the chest wall pain was minimal, the duration of hospital stay (3-5 days) and recovery was short. The widespread use of minimal invasive VATS procedure is an alternative approach that provides safe and less invasive operation for acute chest trauma patients.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24803061/,Cutaneous malignant melanoma: update on diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers,"The incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma has rapidly increased in recent years in all parts of the world, and melanoma is a leading cause of cancer death. As even relatively small melanomas may have metastatic potential, accurate assessment of progression is critical. Although diagnosis of cutaneous malignant melanoma is usually based on histopathologic criteria, these criteria may at times be inadequate in differentiating melanoma from certain types of benign nevi. As for prognosis, tumor (Breslow) thickness, mitotic rate, and ulceration have been considered the most important prognostic indicators among histopathologic criteria. However, there are cases of thin primary melanomas that have ultimately developed metastases despite complete excision. Given this, an accurate assessment of melanoma progression is critical, and development of molecular biomarkers that identify high-risk melanoma in its early phase is urgently needed. Large-scale genomic profiling has identified considerable heterogeneity in melanoma and suggests subgrouping of tumors by patterns of gene expression and mutation will ultimately be essential to accurate staging. This subgrouping in turn may allow for more targeted therapy. In this review, we aim to provide an update on the most promising new biomarkers that may help in the identification and prognostication of melanoma.",,Ossama Abbas;Daniel D Miller;Jag Bhawan,melanoma

Even with effective vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 will likely maintain a hold in the human population through gaps in efficacy, percent vaccinated, and arising new strains. Therefore, understanding how SARS-CoV-2 causes widespread tissue damage and the development of targeted pharmacological treatments will be critical in fighting this virus and preparing for future outbreaks. Herein, we summarize the progress made thus far by using in vitro or in vivo models to investigate individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins and their pathogenic mechanisms. We have grouped the SARS-CoV-2 proteins into three categories: host entry, self-acting, and host interacting. This review focuses on the self-acting and host-interacting SARS-CoV-2 proteins and summarizes current knowledge on how these proteins promote virus replication and disrupt host systems, as well as drugs that target the virus and virus interacting host proteins. Encouragingly, many of these drugs are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. Future coronavirus outbreaks will most likely be caused by new virus strains that evade vaccine protection through mutations in entry proteins. Therefore, study of individual self-acting and host-interacting SARS-CoV-2 proteins for targeted therapeutic interventions is not only essential for fighting COVID-19 but also valuable against future coronavirus outbreaks.",COVID-19; Nsp1; Nsp6; Orf3a; Orf6; Orf7a; SARS-CoV-2; drug development; individual virus proteins; virulence factors; virus-host interactions.,Joyce van de Leemput;Zhe Han,covid-19

No common mutations were found and founder effect was not observed except in Spanish families. The WFS1 gene encodes a putative transmembrane protein of 100.3 kDa localized in endoplasmic reticulum.

Often lost when testing is encouraged is that testing does not by itself confer health benefits. Rather, testing is useful to the extent it forms a critical link to subsequent medical or public health interventions. Such interventions might be individual level, like better diagnosis, treatment, isolation, or quarantine of contacts. They might aid surveillance to understand levels and trends of disease within a defined population that enables informed decisions to implement or relax social distancing measures. In this article, we describe the range of available COVID-19 tests; their accuracy and timing considerations; and the specific clinical, organizational, and public health considerations that warrant different testing strategies. Three representative clinical scenarios illustrate the importance of appropriate test use and interpretation. The reason a patient seeks testing is often a strong indicator of the pretest probability of infection, and thus how to interpret test results.

Emphasis has been placed on using the same method of transplantation, keeping strict records on all passages, and applying the same investigative techniques, in order to trace tumor behavior over long periods of time. This tumor family consists of five variants linked by common origin, but which differ with respect to differentiation level, malignancy, intermediary metabolism, chromosome number, and cell surface properties. Once established, these melanomas possessed a considerable degree of phenotypic stability over decades of passaging. One tumor line in this family is emphasized. The Ab amelanotic melanoma lost its differentiated functions (the ability to synthetize melanin) a quarter of a century ago, and since then has remained dedifferentiated in serial passage in hamsters. After transfer to primary cell culture, the Ab melanoma cells differentiate readily and lose much of their proliferative potential. This process is reversible by reimplantation of the cells into a hamster. Inasmuch as this hamster melanoma system meets many of the conditions required for an experimental tumor model, five melanoma variants are characterized concisely and compared to other melanomas in humans and animals.

Clinicopathologic studies suggest that patients with small choroidal melanomas (less than 10 mm in diameter and 3 mm in height) have an excellent prognosis. In patients with small choroidal melanomas with clear ocular media and no clinical retinal detachment, it is reasonable to do serial examinations without therapeutic intervention until growth is documented. In patients with small choroidal melanomas in which growth is documented, enucleation or alternate modes of therapy, including photocoagulation or radiation, are reasonable methods of treatment.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34070530/,Misdiagnosis of SARS-CoV-2: A Critical Review of the Influence of Sampling and Clinical Detection Methods,"SARS-CoV-2 infection has generated the biggest pandemic since the influenza outbreak of 1918-1919. One clear difference between these pandemics has been the ability to test for the presence of the virus or for evidence of infection. This review examined the performance characteristics of sample types via PCR detection of the virus, of antibody testing, of rapid viral antigen detection kits and computerised tomography (CT) scanning. It was found that combined detection approaches, such as the incorporation of CT scans, may reduce the levels of false negatives obtained by PCR detection in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, while sputum and oral throat washing sample types should take precedence over swabbing when available. Rt-PCR assays for detection of the virus remain the gold-standard method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and can be used effectively on pooled samples for widespread screening. The novel Oxford antibody assay was found to have the highest sensitivity and specificity of four currently available commercial antibody kits but should only be used during a specific timeframe post-symptom onset. Further research into transmission modes between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients is needed. Analysis of the performance characteristics of different sampling and detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 showed that timing of sampling and testing methods used can greatly influence the rate of false-positive and false-negative test results, thereby influencing viral spread.",COVID-19; Rt-PCR; SARS-CoV-2; antibody tests; antigen tests; asymptomatic; detection methods; diagnosis; sampling; symptomatic.,Daniel Keaney;Shane Whelan;Karen Finn;Brigid Lucey,covid-19
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33500453/,A new SYBR Green real-time PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2,"Phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that the etiologic agent of the 2020 pandemic outbreak is a betacoronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. For public health interventions, a diagnostic test with high sensitivity and specificity is required. The gold standard protocol for diagnosis by the Word Health Organization (WHO) is RT-PCR. To detect low viral loads and perform large-scale screening, a low-cost diagnostic test is necessary. Here, we developed a cost-effective test capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2. We validated an auxiliary protocol for molecular diagnosis with the SYBR Green RT-PCR methodology to successfully screen negative cases of SARS-CoV-2. Our results revealed a set of primers with high specificity and no homology with other viruses from the Coronovideae family or human respiratory tract pathogenic viruses, presenting with complementarity only for rhinoviruses/enteroviruses and Legionella spp. Optimization of the annealing temperature and polymerization time led to a high specificity in the PCR products. We have developed a more affordable and swift methodology for negative SARS-CoV-2 screening. This methodology can be applied on a large scale to soften panic and economic burden through guidance for isolation strategies.",,D R Marinowic;G Zanirati;F V F Rodrigues;M V C Grahl;A M Alcará;D C Machado;J C Da Costa,covid-19

In this study, the use of oral rinses (ORs) and posterior oropharyngeal saliva as an alternative to swab collection methods from symptomatic and asymptomatic health care workers for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR was evaluated. For saliva samples, the overall agreement with oropharyngeal swabs was 93% (Ƙ = 0.84), with a sensitivity of 96.7% (95% CI, 83.3%-99.8%). The agreement between saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs was 97.7% (Ƙ = 0.93), with a sensitivity of 94.1% (95% CI, 73.0%-99.7%). ORs were compared with nasopharyngeal swabs only, with an overall agreement of 85.7% (Ƙ = 0.65), and a sensitivity of 63% (95% CI, 46.6%-77.8%). The agreement between a laboratory-developed test based on the CDC RT-PCR and two commercial assays, the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and the Cobas SARS-CoV-2, was also evaluated. The overall agreement was >90%. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva samples was shown to be stable, with no changes in viral loads over 24 hours at both room temperature and 4°C. Although the dilution of SARS-CoV-2 in ORs precluded its acceptability as a sample type, posterior oropharyngeal saliva was an acceptable alternative sample type for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.",,N Esther Babady;Tracy McMillen;Krupa Jani;Agnes Viale;Elizabeth V Robilotti;Anoshe Aslam;Maureen Diver;Desiree Sokoli;Greg Mason;Monika K Shah;Deborah Korenstein;Mini Kamboj,covid-19
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34011679/,Shedding of Viable Virus in Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Carriers,"Information regarding the infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in asymptomatic carriers is scarce. In order to determine the duration of infectivity and its correlation with reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) results and time since initial positive PCR test in this population, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 cell infectivity in nasopharyngeal samples longitudinally obtained from asymptomatic carriers who disembarked from a cruise ship during a COVID-19 outbreak. Of 166 nasopharyngeal samples collected from 39 asymptomatic carriers every 48 h until two consecutive negative PCR test results were obtained, SARS-CoV-2 was successfully isolated from 9 PCR-positive samples which were obtained from 7 persons (18%; 7/39). Viable viruses were isolated predominantly within 7 days after the initial positive PCR test, except for one person who shed viable virus until day 15. The median crossing point (Cp) value of RT-PCR of culture-positive samples was 24.6 (interquartile range [IQR], 20.4 to 25.8; range, 17.9 to 30.3), and Cp values were significantly associated with isolation of viable virus (odds ratio, 0.496; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.329 to 0.747; P value, 0.001), which was consistent with existing data for symptomatic patients. Genome sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 samples consecutively obtained from a person who shed viable virus for 15 days identified the emergence of two novel single nucleotide variants (C8626T transition and C18452T transition) in the sample collected on day 15, with the latter corresponding to an amino acid substitution in nonstructural protein 14. The impact of these mutations on prolonged viable-virus shedding is unclear. These findings underscore the potential role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission.IMPORTANCE A growing number of studies suggest the potential role of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers as a major driver of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, virological assessment of asymptomatic infection has largely been limited to reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), which can be persistently positive without necessarily indicating the presence of viable virus (e.g., replication-competent virus). Here, we evaluated the infectivity of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers by detecting SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effects on Vero cells using longitudinally obtained nasopharyngeal samples from asymptomatic carriers. We show that asymptomatic carriers can shed viable virus until 7 days after the initial positive PCR test, with one outlier shedding until day 15. The crossing point (Cp) value of RT-PCR was the leading predictive factor for virus viability. These findings provide additional insights into the role of asymptomatic carriers as a source of transmission and highlight the importance of universal source control measures, along with isolation policy for asymptomatic carriers.",COVID-19; COVID-19 nucleic acid testing; SARS-CoV-2; asymptomatic infections; carrier state; cell culture techniques; cytopathogenic effect; infectivity; virus shedding; whole-genome sequencing.,Takayuki Murata;Aki Sakurai;Masahiro Suzuki;Satoshi Komoto;Tomihiko Ide;Takuma Ishihara;Yohei Doi,covid-19

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3580350/,Is irradiation a justifiable treatment of choroidal melanoma? Analysis of published results,"Analysis of the literature shows that dissemination of choroidal melanomas generally occurs after the 7 mm diameter stage, that doubling times of uveal melanomas vary from 30 to 365 days, and that death from metastases occurs 30-40 doubling times after dissemination. Tumour related death within three years after therapy is caused by pre-existing metastases. Survival rates for less than four years after therapy are therefore irrelevant in evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic regimens. Considerably higher postirradiation than postenucleation death rates after a mean 10-year follow-up period have been reported, and this difference can be explained by a reported mean clinical tumour regression rate of 31% two years after irradiation and histopathological studies which revealed that 42 out of 43 irradiated melanomas contained viable tumour, while only 50% showed necrosis. The doubtful value of preserving vision does not justify the high risk of avoidable death from metastases in irradiated patients.",,W A Manschot;R Van Strik,melanoma

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33640656/,Emulsion-based isothermal nucleic acid amplification for rapid SARS-CoV-2 detection via angle-dependent light scatter analysis,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, an ongoing global health crisis, has revealed the need for new technologies that integrate the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR tests with a faster time-to-detection. Here, an emulsion loop-mediated isothermal amplification (eLAMP) platform was developed to allow for the compartmentalization of LAMP reactions, leading to faster changes in emulsion characteristics, and thus lowering time-to-detection. Within these droplets, ongoing LAMP reactions lead to adsorption of amplicons to the water-oil interface, causing a decrease in interfacial tension, resulting in smaller emulsion diameters. Changes in emulsion diameter allow for the monitoring of the reaction by use of angle-dependent light scatter (based off Mie scatter theory). Mie scatter simulations confirmed that light scatter intensity is diameter-dependent and smaller colloids have lower intensity values compared to larger colloids. Via spectrophotometers and fiber optic cables placed at 30° and 60°, light scatter intensity was monitored. Scatter intensities collected at 5 min, 30° could statistically differentiate 10, 103, and 105 copies/μL initial concentrations compared to NTC. Similarly, 5 min scatter intensities collected at 60° could statistically differentiate 105 copies/μL initial concentrations in comparison to NTC. The use of both angles during the eLAMP assay allows for distinction between high and low initial target concentrations. The efficacy of a smartphone-based platform was also tested and had a similar limit of detection and assay time of less than 10 min. Furthermore, fluorescence-labeled primers were used to validate target nucleic acid amplification. Compared to existing LAMP assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection, these times-to-detections are very rapid.",COVID-19; Emulsion; Interfacial tension; Loop-mediated isothermal amplification; Mie scatter; SARS-CoV-2.,Alexander S Day;Tiffany-Heather Ulep;Babak Safavinia;Tyler Hertenstein;Elizabeth Budiman;Laurel Dieckhaus;Jeong-Yeol Yoon,covid-19

In the initial screening, 522 hypertensive males were found using epidemiological criteria and 206 of these fulfilled the criteria of definite hypertension. The objective of this study consisted of evaluating, 9 years after the start of the program, the indirect cost in terms of the reduction in the morbidity indicator-temporary work incapacity (TWI). Analysis is based on a comparison of the prevalence of hypertension in the population when the program was begun (6%) and in 1989 (9.8%). It can be observed that the TWI rate of the hypertensive population was significantly higher than that of the rest of the workforce, and that this remained true for the reference group (RG) hypertensives a year after the study was initiated. In contrast, the intervention group (IG) showed significantly lower TWI levels, not only in comparison with the RG but also with the rest of the workers. The estimated reduction in TWI for 1989 was 4.500 days/year, which corresponds to an estimated saving of 76.500.000 pesetas/year.",,S Ruiz de la Fuente Tirado;P Cortina Greus;J L Alfonso Sanchez;C Saiz Sanchez;A Sabater Pons;J I Gonzalez Arraez;C Cortes Vizcaino,hypertension

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3750735/,Morphology and behavior of primary ocular melanomas in 91 dogs,"Primary ocular melanocytic neoplasms from 91 dogs were divided into two groups by histologic criteria. Seventy-five were benign and composed of spindle-shaped and large polyhedral melanocytes similar to those of human ocular melanocytomas. Fifty-nine of these originated in the uvea where most resulted in uveitis, glaucoma, or hyphema prior to enucleation. None metastasized. Nineteen melanocytomas were limbal tumors. None metastasized, but three of nine incompletely excised tumors were found within the anterior chamber 2 to 3 years after the initial removal. Sixteen uveal melanocytic neoplasms were histologically malignant. Three had confirmed metastases, all within 3 months of enucleation. Cell type or pattern of growth within the globe were not predictive of biologic behavior. Our data suggest that the mitotic index is the best criterion for histologic identification of ocular melanomas with high metastatic potential. We propose that the classification of primary ocular melanomas be simplified to include only two categories: melanocytoma (benign) and melanoma (potentially malignant). Further behavioral data may justify a grading scheme for melanomas based upon mitotic index.",,B P Wilcock;R L Peiffer Jr,melanoma

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/736121/,Renal excretion of prostaglandins E2 and F2alpha in diabetes insipidus rats,"On the assumption that the antagonism between prostaglandin E2 and vasopressin might represent a negative feedback system, we evaluated the hypothesis that vasopressin stimulates, in vivo, the renal production of prostaglandins. For these studies we used Brattleboro homozygous rats with diabetes insipidus and Long-Evans rats for controls, Brattleboro homozygotes show a substantial reduction in the renal excretion of prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2alpha. Homozygotes excreted 39 +/- 5 ng/24 h prostaglandin E2 and 40 +/- 4 ng/24 h prostaglandin F2alpha, compared to 217 +/- 40 and 221 +/- 18 ng/24 h, respectively, in control rats (P less than 0.001). Therapy of homozygotes with vasopressin tannate in oil resulted in a prompt increase in the urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2alpha. 1-Desamino-D-arginine vasopressin, a nonpressor analogue of vasopressin, also enhanced the renal production of prostaglandin E2. We conclude that vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) stimulates renal production and excretion of prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2alpha in vivo. It is possible that this increment of prostaglandin synthesis serves a negative feedback function by modulating the action of vasopressin on the renal tubule.",,M J Dunn;H P Greely;H Valtin;L B Kintner;R Beeuwkes 3rd,diabetes
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10409675/,Mutations in the vasopressin prohormone involved in diabetes insipidus impair endoplasmic reticulum export but not sorting,"Familial neurohypophysial diabetes insipidus is characterized by vasopressin deficiency caused by heterozygous expression of a mutated vasopressin prohormone gene. To elucidate the mechanism of this disease, we stably expressed five vasopressin prohormones with a mutation in the neurophysin moiety (NP14G-->R, NP47E-->G, NP47DeltaE, NP57G-->S, and NP65G-->V) in the neuroendocrine cell lines Neuro-2A and PC12/PC2. Metabolic labeling demonstrated that processing and secretion of all five mutants was impaired, albeit to different extents (NP65G-->V >/= NP14G-->R > NP47DeltaE >/= NP47E-->G > NP57G-->S). Persisting endoglycosidase H sensitivity revealed these defects to be due to retention of mutant prohormone in the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutant prohormones that partially passed the endoplasmic reticulum were normally targeted to the regulated secretory pathway. Surprisingly, this also included mutants with mutations in residues involved in binding of vasopressin to neurophysin, a process implicated in targeting of the prohormone. To mimick the high expression in vasopressin-producing neurons, mutant vasopressin prohormones were transiently expressed in Neuro-2A cells. Immunofluorescence displayed formation of large accumulations of mutant prohormone in the endoplasmic reticulum, accompanied by redistribution of an endoplasmic reticulum marker. Our data suggest that prolonged perturbation of the endoplasmic reticulum eventually leads to degeneration of neurons expressing mutant vasopressin prohormones, explaining the dominant nature of the disease.",,M Nijenhuis;R Zalm;J P Burbach,diabetes

Consequently the present study was undertaken to provide information on the origin, size and topographic relationships of the collateral intercostal artery. Ninety cadaveric adult intercostal spaces were dissected using standard procedures. The collateral intercostal arteries were exposed throughout their full length and measured at the points within the intercostal spaces considered to be the most important for clinical purposes. The posterior intercostal arteries and their collateral branches were observed to decrease in size from posterior to anterior; however, no significant differences were present in their size in the first four intercostal spaces. Based on these findings the usual thoracocentesis or thoracoscopy technique, in which it is recommended that puncture is done as close as possible to the superior margin of the inferior rib, may lead to collateral intercostal artery laceration and considerable bleeding. A subtle, but important, modification to this technique is suggested aimed at achieving safer access to the intercostal space. In the modified technique, the puncture should be made in the middle of the intercostal space, thereby reducing the possibility of laceration of the collateral intercostal artery.",,R Porto Da Rocha;A Vengjer;A Blanco;P Traballi de Carvalho;M Leal Dias Mongon;G J Medeiros Fernandes,chest

In this era of resource rationalisation, we seek to address the issue of whether routine full-skin examination by a dermatologist, rather than focussed examination of flagged lesions, will increase melanoma diagnosis. A retrospective chart review was undertaken between 1 July 2007 and 30 June 2008 in a private dermatology group practice in order to ascertain the number and characteristics of incidentally detected melanomas on routine skin examination. A total of 94 melanomas were detected during this 12-month period.
