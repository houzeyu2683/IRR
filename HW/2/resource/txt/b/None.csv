https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32323265/,B Cell Development and Maturation,"Since the identification of B cells in 1965 (Cooper et al. 1965), three has been tremendous progress in our understanding of B cell development, maturation and function. A number of B cell subpopulations, including B-1, B-2 and regulatory B cells, have been identified. B-1 cells mainly originate from the fetal liver and contain B-1a and B-1b subsets. B-2 cells are derived from the bone marrow (BM) and can be further classified into follicular B (FOB) and marginal zone B (MZB) cells. Regulatory B cells (Bregs) function to suppress immune responses, primarily by production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. B cell tolerance is established at several checkpoints, during B cell development in the BM (central tolerance) as well as during B cell maturation and activation in the periphery (peripheral tolerance). This chapter will focus on the regulation of important processes during the development and maturation of B-1 and B-2 cells.",B-1; Follicular B; Ig gene; Marginal zone B; V(D)J recombination.,Ying Wang;Jun Liu;Peter D Burrows;Ji-Yang Wang
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26576083/,Hepatitis B virus burden in developing countries,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has shown an intermediate or high endemicity level in low-income countries over the last five decades. In recent years, however, the incidence of acute hepatitis B and the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen chronic carriers have decreased in several countries because of the HBV universal vaccination programs started in the nineties. Some countries, however, are still unable to implement these programs, particularly in their hyperendemic rural areas. The diffusion of HBV infection is still wide in several low-income countries where the prevention, management and treatment of HBV infection are a heavy burden for the governments and healthcare authorities. Of note, the information on the HBV epidemiology is scanty in numerous eastern European and Latin-American countries. The studies on molecular epidemiology performed in some countries provide an important contribution for a more comprehensive knowledge of HBV epidemiology, and phylogenetic studies provide information on the impact of recent and older migratory flows.",Chronic hepatitis; Developing countries; Hepatitis B virus; Molecular epidemiology; Prevention.,Rosa Zampino;Adriana Boemio;Caterina Sagnelli;Loredana Alessio;Luigi Elio Adinolfi;Evangelista Sagnelli;Nicola Coppola

Many viral factors, such as viral load, genotype, and specific viral mutations, are known to affect disease progression. HBV reverse transcriptase does not have a proofreading function, therefore, many HBV genotypes, sub-genotypes, mutants, and recombinants emerge. Differences between genotypes in response to antiviral treatment have been determined. To date, 10 HBV genotypes, scattered across different geographical regions, have been identified. For example, genotype A has a tendency for chronicity, whereas viral mutations are frequently encountered in genotype C. Both chronicity and mutation frequency are common in genotype D. LC and progression to HCC are more commonly encountered with genotypes C and D than the other genotypes. Pathogenic differences between HBV genotypes explain disease intensity, progression to LC, and HCC. In conclusion, genotype determination in CHB infection is important in estimating disease progression and planning optimal antiviral treatment.",Anti-viral therapy; Chronic hepatitis B; Genotypes; Hepatitis B virus; Viral mutation.,Mustafa Sunbul

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29895151/,Hepatitis B virus vaccine breakthrough infection: surveillance of S gene mutants of HBV,"Hepatitis B (HB) is a worldwide public health problem, closely related with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The implementation of universal hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination programs has led to significant reduction in incidence of acute and chronic HB, liver cirrhosis and HCC. However, this success is now being threatened by the discovery of HBV vaccine breakthrough infection caused by the S gene mutants of HBV, high maternal viral load and virus-induced immunosuppression. An alteration in the antigenicity and immunogenicity of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) due to S gene mutations may compromise detection of HBsAg (diagnosis-escape mutants), treatment with hepatitis B-specific immunoglobulin (HBIG), and even cause infections in individuals who are antihepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) antibody-positive after immunization (vaccine-escape mutants). By surveilling for S gene mutants of HBV among vaccinated population, we will have a better understanding of the mechanism of HBV vaccine breakthrough infection; potentially providing new ideas for designing better diagnostic assays and effective vaccines for prevention and treatment of HBV. This review attempts to briefly summarize the status and role of S gene mutations, B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitope mutants, and surveillance of mutant HBV variants in a hospital setting.",HBV vaccine breakthrough infection; S gene; mutants; surveillance..,Y Qin;P Liao
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12699402/,Recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B): a review of its immunogenicity and protective efficacy against hepatitis B,"Engerix-B (Hep-B[Eng]) is a noninfectious recombinant DNA vaccine containing hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). It is produced from genetically engineered yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Intramuscular Hep-B(Eng) [0-, 1-, 6-month schedule] has excellent immunogenicity in healthy neonates and infants, children, adolescents and adults, with seroprotection rates of 85-100% seen approximate, equals 1 month after the final dose of vaccine; seroprotection was defined as an antibody against HBsAg (anti-HBs) titre of > or =10 IU/L. The use of alternative Hep-B(Eng) immunisation schedules (e.g. a 0-, 1-, 2-, 12-month schedule in neonates and infants, 0-, 12-, 24-month or two-dose schedules in children and adolescents, and accelerated schedules in adults) have also been associated with high rates of seroprotection. Seroprotection rates were generally similar with Hep-B(Eng) and the recombinant vaccine Recombivax HB (Hep-B[Rax]) or plasma-derived vaccines (PDVs) approximate, equals 1 month after the final dose (although anti-HBs geometric mean titres were significantly higher with Hep-B[Eng] than with Hep-B[Rax]). One month after the final dose, adults had significantly higher seroprotection rates with the recombinant triple-antigen vaccine Bio-Hep-B (Hep-B[Bio]) than with Hep-B(Eng), although seroprotection rates in healthy infants were similar with Hep-B(Eng) and Hep-B(Bio). Hep-B(Eng) had excellent immunogenicity in several groups considered at high risk of acquiring hepatitis B (e.g. neonates born to hepatitis B carrier mothers and healthcare workers). The immunogenicity of Hep-B(Eng) was reduced in patients with conditions associated with impaired immune function (e.g. patients undergoing haemodialysis or being treated for malignancy), although it had good immunogenicity in patients with diabetes mellitus.Hep-B(Eng) had excellent protective efficacy against HBsAg carriage in healthy infants and children, and in neonates born to hepatitis B carrier mothers (protective efficacy of 95-99%). Hep-B(Eng) also demonstrated good protective efficacy in a number of other high-risk groups. Hep-B(Eng) is generally well tolerated with a tolerability profile similar to that of Hep-B(Rax), Hep-B(Bio) and PDVs. In conclusion, Hep-B(Eng) is a well established, highly immunogenic hepatitis B vaccine with good tolerability and excellent protective efficacy; it offers flexibility through a variety of immunisation schedules. In addition, it appears that Hep-B(Eng) confers immunity for at least 10 years. Hep-B(Eng) has an important role in mass vaccination campaigns against hepatitis B, as well as in groups considered at high risk of acquiring hepatitis B.",,Gillian M Keating;Stuart Noble
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31608073/,Toward a Functional Cure for Hepatitis B: The Rationale and Challenges for Therapeutic Targeting of the B Cell Immune Response,"The central role of the cellular immune response in the control and clearance of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been well-established. The contribution of humoral immunity, including B cell and antibody responses against HBV, has been investigated for a long time but has attracted increasing attention again in recent years. The anti-HBs antibody was first recognized as a marker of protective immunity after the acute resolution of the HBV infection (or vaccination) and is now defined as a biomarker for the functional cure of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). In this way, therapies targeting HBV-specific B cells and the induction of an anti-HBs antibody response are essential elements of a rational strategy to terminate chronic HBV infection. However, a high load of HBsAg in the blood, which has been proposed to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance, represents a major obstacle to curing CHB. Long-term antiviral treatment by nucleoside analogs, by targeting viral translation by siRNA, by inhibiting HBsAg release via nucleic acid polymers, or by neutralizing HBsAg via specific antibodies could potentially reduce the HBsAg load in CHB patients. A combined strategy including a reduction of the HBsAg load via the above treatments and the therapeutic targeting of B cells by vaccination may induce the appearance of anti-HBs antibodies and lead to a functional cure of CHB.",B cell response; chronic hepatitis B; functional cure; hepatitis B virus; therapeutic vaccine.,Zhiyong Ma;Ejuan Zhang;Shicheng Gao;Yong Xiong;Mengji Lu

HBV causes chronic infection in patients and can lead to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and other severe liver diseases. Thus, understanding HBV-related pathogenesis is of particular importance for prevention and clinical intervention. HBV surface antigens are indispensable for HBV virion formation and are useful viral markers for diagnosis and clinical assessment. During chronic HBV infection, HBV genomes may acquire and accumulate mutations and deletions, leading to the expression of defective HBV surface antigens. These defective HBV surface antigens have been found to play important roles in the progression of HBV-associated liver diseases. In this review, we focus our discussion on the nature of defective HBV surface antigen mutations and their contribution to the pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis B.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27107897/,A historical perspective on the discovery and elucidation of the hepatitis B virus,"The discovery in 1965 of the ""Australia antigen,"" subsequently identified as the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), was such a watershed event in virology that it is often thought to mark the beginning of hepatitis research, but it is more accurately seen as a critical breakthrough in a long effort to understand the pathogenesis of infectious hepatitis. A century earlier, Virchow provided an authoritative explanation of ""catarrhal jaundice,"" which did not consider an infectious etiology, but the transmission of jaundice by human serum was clearly identified in two outbreaks in 1885, and the distinction between ""infectious"" and ""serum"" hepatitis was recognized by the early 1920s. The inability to culture a virus or reproduce either syndrome in laboratory animals led to numerous studies in human volunteers; by the end of World War II, it was known that the diseases were caused by different filterable agents, and the terms ""hepatitis A"" and ""B"" were introduced in 1947 (though some long-incubation cases then designated B must in retrospect have been hepatitis C). The development of a number of liver function tests during the 1950s led to the recognition of anicteric infections and the existence of chronic carriers, but little more could be done until an infectious agent had been identified. Once Blumberg and colleagues had found a specific viral marker, the vast amount of accumulated epidemiologic and clinical data, together with huge numbers of stored serum samples, enabled rapid progress in understanding hepatitis B, and revealed the existence of a vast population of chronically infected people in Asia, Oceania and Africa. In this article, we place the identification of the Australia antigen within the historical context of research on viral hepatitis. Following a chronological review from 1865 to 1965, we summarize how the discovery led to improved safety of blood transfusion, the development of a highly effective vaccine and the eventual identification of the hepatitis C, D and E viruses.

Hepatitis B virus infection in transplant procedures other than liver is a major concern because it can be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after transplant. Due to the increased risk of hepatic complications, such as fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis or histologic deterioration after transplant, systematic use of nucleoside or nucleotide analogues shortly before or at the time of transplant is recommended (tenofovir or entecavir are preferable to lamivudine) in all patients, whatever the baseline histologic evaluation. Sustained viral suppression may result in regression of fibrosis, which in turn may lead to decreased disease-related morbidity and improved survival. Finally, due to the high mortality after nonliver transplant procedures, decompensated cirrhosis from chronic hepatitis B should be considered as a contraindication to nonliver transplant but an indication to combined organ transplant (ie, liver-kidney transplant). Because of the high prevalence of hepatitis B virus exposure in allograft donors and recipients, hepatitis B virus status must be considered during organ allocation.

Here, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for B cell hyperactivation during HBV infection. Peripheral CD19+ B cells isolated from 4 CHB patients and 4 healthy volunteers were analysed by RNA sequencing. A total of 1401 differentially expressed genes were identified from B cell transcriptome of CHB patients vs healthy volunteers. We found that B cells from CHB patients were functional impaired, with increased TLR4 expression, activated NF-κB pathway and altered mitochondrial function. The expression of B cell activation-related genes, including TLR4, was further validated using additional clinical samples. To further verify the role of TLR4 in B cell activation during CHB, B cell phenotypes were determined in wild-type (WT) and TLR4-/- HBV-carrier mice. Hyperactivated B cell and TLR4 signalling pathway were observed in WT HBV-carrier mice, while TLR4 ablation failed to induce B cell hyperactivation, and downstream MyD88 and NF-κB were also not altered.

An increase in the hydrophilicity was observed after treatment of non-charged isoporous membranes from PS-b-P4VP-b-PSMA, through acidic hydrolysis of the hydrophobic poly(solketal methacrylate) PSMA block into a hydrophilic poly(glyceryl methacrylate) PGMA block, which contains two neighbored hydroxyl (-OH) groups per repeating unit. For the first time, PS-b-P4VP-b-PSMA triblock terpolymers with varying compositions were successfully synthesized by sequential living anionic polymerization. Composite membranes of PS-b-P4VP-b-PSMA and PS-b-P4VP-b-PGMA triblock terpolymers with ordered hexagonally packed cylindrical pores were developed. The morphology of the membranes was studied with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). PS-b-P4VP-b-PSMA triblock terpolymer membranes were further treated with acid (1 M HCl) to get polystyrene-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine)-b-poly(glyceryl methacrylate) (PS-b-P4VP-b-PGMA). Notably, the pristine porous membrane structure could be maintained even after acidic hydrolysis. It was found that membranes containing hydroxyl groups (PS-b-P4VP-b-PGMA) show a stable and higher water permeance than membranes without hydroxyl groups (PS-b-P4VP-b-PSMA), what is due to the increase in hydrophilicity. The membrane properties were analyzed further by contact angle, protein retention, and adsorption measurements.","acidic hydrolysis; isoporous membrane; non-solvent-induced phase separation (NIPS), ultrafiltration; self-assembly; triblock terpolymer.",Sarah Saleem;Sofia Rangou;Clarissa Abetz;Volkan Filiz;Volker Abetz

Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) results in the development of significant clinical outcomes such as liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which are associated with high mortality rates. HBV is a non-cytopathic virus, with the host's immune response responsible for the associated liver damage. Indeed, HBV appears to be a master of manipulating and modulating the immune response to achieve persistent and chronic infection. The HBV precore protein or hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) is a key viral protein involved in these processes, for instance though the down-regulation of the innate immune response.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15756147/,Natural history of hepatitis B,"The natural course of hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronic infection is variable, ranging from an inactive HBsAg carrier state to a more or less progressive chronic hepatitis, potentially evolving to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Chronic hepatitis may present as typical HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B or HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B. HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis is due to wild type HBV; it represents the early phase of chronic HBV infection. HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis is due to a naturally occurring HBV variant with mutations in the precore or/and basic core promoter regions of the genome; it represents a late phase of chronic HBV infection. The latter form of the disease has been recognized as increasing in many countries within the last decade and it represents the majority of cases in many countries. HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B is generally associated with a more severe liver disease with a very low rate of spontaneous disease remission and a low sustained response rate to antiviral therapy. Longitudinal studies of patients with chronic hepatitis B indicate that, after diagnosis, the 5-year cumulative incidence of developing cirrhosis ranges from 8-20%. Morbidity and mortality in chronic hepatitis B are linked to evolution to cirrhosis or HCC. The 5-year cumulative incidence of hepatic decompensation is approximately 20%. The 5-year probability of survival is approximately 80-86% in patients with compensated cirrhosis. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis have a poor prognosis (14-35% probability of survival at 5 years).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23286861/,Management of acute hepatitis B and reactivation of hepatitis B,"The natural course of hepatitis B virus infection and the resulting hepatic injury is determined by the degree of virus replication and the intensity of host immune response. Upon exposure to hepatitis B virus (HBV), individuals with a vigorous and broad immune response develop acute self-limited infection, which may result in acute hepatitis. However, with stringent testing for HBV and universal precautions, acute HBV is rather rare. Reactivation of HBV most often presents as acute hepatitis B (AVH-B) and clinically, it is difficult to differentiate AVH-B from reactivation of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and it requires a high index of suspicion. In the presence of high HBV DNA (>2 × 10(4) IU/ml) underlying liver disease should be investigated by liver biopsy, endoscopy and/or imaging. The degree of liver failure often depends on the severity of acute insult and the stage of underlying chronic liver disease. Mutations in the HBV genome, immunosuppressive therapy and viral or drug induced injury are common causes of reactivation. As most patients with AVH-B resolve the infection spontaneously, antiviral therapy is not indicated in them. However, the use of a potent oral nucleoside(tide) analogue is necessary as soon as possible in patients with CHB reactivation. Liver transplantation should be considered in patients who develop liver failure secondary to severe acute exacerbation.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9824778/,Nuclear factor kappa B: important transcription factor and therapeutic target,"Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) is an ubiquitous rapid response transcription factor in cells involved in immune and inflammatory reactions, and exerts its effect by expressing cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, growth factors, and immunoreceptors. In this manner, NF-kappa B contributes to immunologically mediated diseases such as allograft rejection, rheumatoid arthritis, and bronchial asthma. The prototypic inducible form of NF-kappa B is a heterodimer composed of NF-kB1 and RelA, which both belong to the NF-kappa B/Rel family of proteins. Inactive NF-kappa B is present in the cytoplasm complexed with an inhibitory protein, I kappa B. NF-kappa B is activated by a number of incoming signals from the cell surface. Released from I kappa B inhibition, NF-kappa B translocates into the nucleus and binds to the kappa B motif of the target gene. The NF-kappa B activation process can be inhibited by pharmacologic agents at each activation step. Glucocorticoids inhibit NF-kappa B by directly associating with NF-kappa B or by upregulating I kappa B expression. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus prevent NF-kappa B activation by inhibiting the action of calcineurin, a phosphatase that indirectly induces I kappa B degradation. Deoxyspergualin inhibits NF-kappa B by blocking its nuclear translocation. Aspirin and salicylates inhibit upstream events inducing I kappa B phosphorylation. Tepoxalin and antioxidants inhibit NF-kappa B activation by influencing the redox state of the cell.

The data show that phenotypically B-1a and B-1b cells are essentially identical, distinguished only by the presence or absence of the CD5 antigen. Functionally no differences between the two populations have yet been identified. Both produce anti-PtC antibodies, a specificity not observed in conventional B cells. Both produced high levels of IgM as measured in adoptive transfer experiments. Developmentally, B-1a and B-1b cells are indistinguishable with respect to generation from progenitors present in fetal liver and omentum, feedback regulation of new B-1a and B-1b cells from bone marrow, self-replenishment from Ig+ cells following adoptive transfer, and the generation of clonal populations. The major difference in the two populations is seen in the development of B-1a and B-1b cells from B220- progenitors in the adult bone marrow. Although B220- B-1a progenitors are rare in adult (greater than 6 weeks) bone marrow, the progenitors for B-1b cells persist well into adulthood. Our understanding of B-1b cell ontogeny is at a stage similar to that of B-1a cells five years ago. We have evidence from transfer experiments that strongly suggests the existence of two distinct progenitors for B-1a and B-1b, but we have yet to physically separate these progenitors as Solvansen et al. have done for B-1 and conventional B cells. Furthermore we must determine whether the B-1b cells that develop from fetal liver and bone marrow are functionally and developmentally equivalent to those that develop from adult bone marrow. As with B-1a cells, the role of B-1b cells in the immune system is unclear. Although we have not yet discerned functional differences between B-1a and B-1b, given the recent identification of CD72 (Lyb-2) as the ligand for CD5, it is tempting to speculate that B-1a cells are more involved in B-B cell interactions such as idiotype-anti-idiotype regulation of the early B-cell repertoire and that B-1b cells are more involved in B-T cell interactions.

A lower baseline hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level is a strong predictor of the response to antiviral therapy. HBV genotype A/B patients have better responses to interferon-based therapy than those with genotypes C/D. Regarding the association of HBV mutants with responses to antiviral therapy, current evidence is limited. On-treatment viral suppression is the most important predictor of response to nucleoside analogs. On-treatment hepatitis B surface antigen decline is significantly associated with response to pegylated interferon. In the future, individualized therapy should be based on treatment efficacy, adverse effects, baseline and on-treatment predictors of antiviral therapy.",,Chih-Lin Lin;Jia-Horng Kao

In contrast, those who are infected at birth or early childhood (including the majority of the world's hepatitis B carriers, i.e. Asians) have a prolonged immune tolerance phase followed by a prolonged immune clearance phase. A proportion of these patients have progressive disease after HBeAg seroconversion with HBV DNA <10(4) copies/mL (<2000 IU/mL) and ALT between 0.5 and 2x upper limit of normal. Core promoter mutations may play a part in the development of cirrhosis-related complications.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection may cause hepatic cirrhosis and liver cancer. It is estimated that there are more than 350 million chronic HBV carriers worldwide, of whom approximately one quarter will die of chronic hepatitis B-related liver diseases. HBV is transmitted horizontally through blood and blood products or by sexual transmission, and vertically from mother to infant. Perinatal infection is the predominant mode of transmission in countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriage, and perinatal transmission leads to high rates of chronic infection. Therefore, it is important to prevent the mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HBV. Research has shown that pregnant women with high HBV DNA levels have an increased risk of MTCT. However, most of the obstetrics guidelines do not make a distinction between pregnant women with high HBV DNA levels and those who are HBsAg positive only.

The hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) contains the large (L), middle (M), and small (S) surface proteins. The L protein consists of the S protein, preS1, and preS2. In HBsAg, the preS domain (preS1 + preS2) plays a key role in the infection of hepatocytic cells by HBV and has several immunogenic epitopes. Based on these characteristics of preS, several preS-based diagnostic and therapeutic materials and systems have been developed. PreS1-specific monoclonal antibodies (e.g., MA18/7 and KR127) can be used to inhibit HBV infection. A myristoylated preS1 peptide (amino acids 2-48) also inhibits the attachment of HBV to HepaRG cells, primary human hepatocytes, and primary tupaia hepatocytes. Antibodies and antigens related to the components of HBsAg, preS (preS1 + preS2), or preS1 can be available as diagnostic markers of acute and chronic HBV infections. Hepatocyte-targeting delivery systems for therapeutic molecules (drugs, genes, or proteins) are very important for increasing the clinical efficacy of these molecules and in reducing their adverse effects on other organs. The selective delivery of diagnostic molecules to target hepatocytic cells can also improve the efficiency of diagnosis. In addition to the full-length HBV vector, preS (preS1 + preS2), preS1, and preS1-derived fragments can be useful in hepatocyte-specific targeting.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23286858/,Treatment of HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B: interferon or nucleoside analogues,"Interferon alpha has restricted efficacy in as much as only a proportion of patients show a response. However, in appropriately selected HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients, sustained suppression of viral replication can be achieved, and HBeAg or even HBsAg seroconversion can be attained. Thus, finite course of interferon alpha can be successful, and offer an advantage to patient. Interferon (IFN) remains a benchmark therapy for chronic hepatitis B. The main advantages of IFN-α over nucleoside analogues are the absence of resistance and the possibility of immune-mediated clearance of hepatitis B. Unfortunately, side effects preclude the use of interferon alpha in substantial proportions of patients, and prolonged maintenance therapy to suppress hepatitis B virus (HBV) is not feasible. Nucleoside analogues are given by mouth, once per day, and the safety, potency and efficacy have improved and facilitated treatment. However, maintenance of long-term suppression is required for the majority of patients. In general, treatment of chronic hepatitis B should target patients with active disease and viral replication, preferably before the signs and symptoms of cirrhosis or significant injury has occurred. Current EASL guidelines suggest that treatment be based on the evaluation of three criteria: Serum aminotransferase levels, serum HBV DNA levels and histological grade and stage. Many questions remain unanswered on the optimal treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B with a nucleoside vs interferon alpha. Both forms of treatment have benefits and the choice should be selected and tailored. Stopping or futility rules can be implemented in patients who fail interferon.

It differs from B*14:13 by one base (103G>T) in exon 2 resulting in a substitution of alanine (A) in B*14:13 to serine (S) in B*14:53. Unique among current HLA-B*14 alleles, B*14:53 and B*14:13 share a motif of 59 bases between positions 361 and 419 in exon 3. This motif is present in numerous HLA-B alleles the commonest overall being B*08:01, suggesting that both B*14:53 and B*14:13 arose from intralocus gene conversion events with B*08:01. Thus, B*14:53 probably arose from B*14:01:01 (which has TCC at codon 11 (S), while B*14:13 arose from B*14:02:01:01 which has GCC at codon 11 (A). Additionally, the two likely B*14:53-bearing and B*14:13-bearing haplotypes are typical of B*14:01:01-bearing and B*14:02:01:01-bearing haplotypes, respectively. Serological testing, using 49 antisera with HLA-B64, or B64, B65 reactivity, showed that the B*14:53 specificity did not react as a B64 (B*14:01) specificity and may appear as a short/weak HLA-B14. This implies that residues additional to S at position 11 are involved in HLA-B64 serological identity; for example, the motif 11S 97W 116F is possessed by B*14:01 and many other B*14 products (and B*39:79 plus some HLA-C products) but not B65 (B*14:02) or the B*14:53 specificity.

In contrast, late or absent HBeAg seroconversion after multiple hepatitis flares accelerates the progression of chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis. Recently, several hepatitis B viral factors predictive of clinical outcomes have been identified. For example, serum HBV DNA level at enrollment is the best predictor of adverse outcomes (cirrhosis, HCC and death from liver disease) in adults with chronic HBV infection. In addition, HBV genotype C, basal core promoter (BCP) mutant and pre-S deletion mutant are associated with increased risk of HCC development. In conclusion, hepatitis B viral factors such as serum HBV DNA level, genotype and mutants have already been clarified to influence disease progression of chronic hepatitis B. Further studies are needed to investigate the pathogenic mechanism of each viral factor.",,Chih-Lin Lin;Jia-Horng Kao

Reportedly, HBV/C infection has been associated with more severe disease progression, manifesting as developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), than HBV/B infection. However, no long-term studies have examined the development of HCC in HBV/B-infected patients in Japan. The aims of our study were to compare the incidence of HCC in HBV/B- or HBV/C-infected patients. A total of 241 patients were followed up among 295 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive carriers. Genotypes of HBV were A in 1% (4/295), B in 61% (179/295), C in 37% (110/295) and D in 1% (2/295) patients, and 96% of HBV/B were infected with subgenotype Bj. The mean age at HCC diagnosis was significantly higher in HBV/B than in HBV/C (67.0 ± 10.0 vs 57.7 ± 8.0 years, P < 0.001). The value of FIB-4 index was significantly higher in HBV/B than in HBV/C (P < 0.01). The rate of HCC was higher in HBV/C than in HBV/B, and a significant difference was observed until the 20-year observation period (P = 0.048). However, thereafter, HCC associated with HBV/B increased, and no significant difference was observed between HBV/B and HBV/C. HCC development was consistently observed even in HBV/B infection, especially among elderly patients with advanced fibrosis compared with HBV/C. HBV/B-infected patients developed HCC later in life, and in the long term, we found no differences in incidence of HCC development rates between these two genotypes.",hepatitis B virus; hepatocellular carcinoma; viral genotypes.,Hiroaki Haga;Takafumi Saito;Kazuo Okumoto;Kyoko Tomita;Tomohiro Katsumi;Kei Mizuno;Taketo Nishina;Hisayoshi Watanabe;Yoshiyuki Ueno

In addition to host factors, several viral factors including HBV genotype, viral load, specific viral mutations and quantitative HBsAg levels, have been associated with disease outcomes. Among viral factors, HBV genotype correlates with not only the clinical outcomes, but also with the response to interferon treatment. Currently, 10 HBV genotypes have been identified. Compared with genotype A and B cases, patients with genotypes C and D have lower rates and usually delayed onset of spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion. HBV-genotype C has a higher frequency of basal core promoter (BCP) A1762T/G1764A mutation and preS deletion, and a higher viral load than genotype B. Similarly, genotype D has a higher prevalence of BCP A1762T/G1764A mutation than genotype A. These observations suggest pathogenic differences between HBV genotypes.

In the last few decades, major advances have been achieved that have contributed to greater understanding of the natural history and clinical manifestations of this infection. The fluctuation between viral replication and the host's immune response has implications in the pathogenesis and progression of the hepatic lesion. In immunocompetent adults, most HBV infections resolve spontaneously in contrast with progression to chronic infection in most infants. Patients with chronic hepatitis due to HBV or chronic hepatitis B can present at four phases: 1) the immune tolerance phase, 2) HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B, 3) inactive HBsAg carrier state, and 4) HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis. HBeAg-positive or -negative chronic hepatitis can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Progression to these complications is more frequent in HBeAg-negative forms, associated with mutations that affect the pre-core region and maintain active viral replication. Risk factors are HBV-DNA positive serum levels, an increase in serum transaminase levels and some genotypes. These factors highlight the need to evaluate and monitor all HBV carriers to identify those who could benefit from early antiviral treatment, thus avoiding progression to more advanced forms of liver disease.

In the case of hepatitis B virus (HBV), sequencing studies have identified a number of virus variants normally found during the natural course of chronic infection. The appearance of the precore stop codon (with G-for-A substitution at position 1896) and basal core promoter (BCP) (with A-for-T and G-for-A, at positions 1762 and 1764, respectively) variants which reduce or abrogate hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) production, heralds the initiation of the seroconversion phase from HBeAg to anti-HBe positivity. The gradual removal of the tolerogenic effect of HBeAg leads to the awakening of the immune response (immune clearance phase). Most patients after HBeAg seroconversion become ""inactive HBsAg carriers"". However during the course of infection precore and/or BCP variants may emerge and be selected leading to HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) with high viremia levels (reactivation phase). The prevalence of HBeAg negative CHB has been increasing over the last few decades and has become the commonest type of HBV infection in many countries of the world. This probably reflects the aging of existing HBV carriers and the effective prevention measures restricting new HBV infections. Frequent acute exacerbations accompanied by high viral replication, elevated alanine aminotransferase levels and histological activity are a common feature of HBeAg negative CHB leading to cirrhosis much faster than in HBeAg positive CHB patients.","Hepatitis B virus-DNA replication; Precore stop codon variants, basal core promoter variants; Re-activation; hepatitis B e antigen negative chronic hepatitis B.",Alexandra Alexopoulou;Peter Karayiannis

The pathology of hepatitis B infection results mainly from the self-destructive cytotoxic T cell response of the host. This may be modulated by soluble pre-core e antigen of the virus that induces immune tolerance and by cytokines elaborated by cytotoxic T cells, which suppress viral replication in the infected cell. Pathogenesis of the disease is markedly influenced by viral mutations. Persistent hepatitis B virus infection may be controlled in a minority of patients by passive alpha-interferon therapy, and in a majority of patients by the nucleoside lamivudine until resistance develops. The best means to control the disease is by prevention through application of the highly effective vaccine prepared using surface antigen of the virus. It is anticipated that the gradually increasing application of the vaccine throughout the world may lead to elimination of hepatitis B as an important medical problem.

To study the mechanisms of this approach, mice were immunized with HBsAg or IC (immunogenic complex, i.e. HBsAg complexed with mouse polyclonal anti-HBs). Studies indicate that IC induced enhanced immune responses by increasing uptake of HBsAg through Fc receptors on antigen presenting cells and modulated HBsAg processing and presentation. This modulation led to stimulation of T cell responses, and increased production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma. Assay for antibody subclasses showed that higher ratio of IgG 2a was observed in the IC immunized group, which correlated with the production of lymphokine pattern. When alum was used as the adjuvant, though antibody response was enhanced, production of cytokines decreased. When DNA from a recombinant plasmid was added to IC as an adjuvant, the titer of anti-HBs was significantly higher than those in mice immunized only with the DNA or the IC.

Laboratory tests are available for the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease. Therapies have been developed to halt the progress of the chronic infection in affected individuals. While these developments have resulted in a decrease of the frequency of infection in many countries, particularly those that have implemented universal immunization of newborns, the chronic infection remains a significant global problem. Worldwide, over 300 million individuals are infected and each year, an estimated 1 million persons die from chronic complications of the disease including hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic failure. The therapies currently available result in elimination of the virus in only a relatively small proportion of subjects and carry with it serious side effects. Geopolitical, economic and other factors hinder the vision of elimination of the infection through immunization programmes. Nevertheless, work continues to clarify further the underlying pathological mechanism of the infection, the host and viral factors that promote elimination or persistence of the virus in the human host. It is hoped that such investigations will reveal viral targets for the design of newer and potentially more effective drugs to treat the infection.",,S F Yap
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11509869/,DNA vaccines for prophylactic or therapeutic immunization against hepatitis B,"DNA-based or genetic vaccination is an efficient new technique to stimulate specific immune responses after in vivo delivery of bacterial plasmids encoding antigens. In mice and in various other animal models for hepadnavirus infection, DNA vaccines specific for hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigens induce a strong humoral and cell-mediated immunity that confers protection in some models. Although there are effective prophylactic vaccines already available for HBV, there is currently no effective treatment for chronic HBV infection. Patients with HBV-associated liver disease are at increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma and would greatly benefit from the availability of a therapeutic vaccine against HBV. By inducing immune responses closely related to those involved in clearing virus from the host, DNA vaccines may represent an alternative therapeutic approach for chronic HBV infection.",,M L Michel;D Loirat

B-1 cells are further subdivided into B-1a and B-1b subsets as the former but not the later express CD5. The B-1a subset contributes to innate type of immune responses while the B-1b B cell subset contributes to adaptive responses. B-1 cell responses to B cell receptor (BCR) as well as Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligation are tightly regulated due to the cross-reactivity of antigen specific receptors on B-1 cells to self-antigens. B-1 cells are elevated in several autoimmune diseases. CD5 plays a major role in down regulation of BCR responses in the B-1a cell subset. Reduced amplification of BCR induced signals via CD19 and autoregulation of BCR and TLR responses by B-1 cell produced IL-10 appear to have a role in regulation of both B-1a and B-1b B cell responses. Siglec G receptors and Lyn kinase also regulate B-1 cell responses but their differential role in the two B-1 cell subsets is unknown.,B cell receptor; B lymphocyte; B-1 cell; CD19; CD5; IL-10; SHP-1; Toll-like receptor.,Vishal J Sindhava;Subbarao Bondada

The actuality of this problem is associated with the fact, that occult hepatitis B (OHB) can be transmitted during hemotransfusions, cause reactivation of chronic hepatitis B in immune compromised individuals, facilitate development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Several different hypotheses of OHB immunopathogenesis have been proposed, including a low number of copies of HBV DNA, altered immune response of the macroorganism, genetic variability of the S gene, integration of viral DNA into host genome, infection of mononuclear cells of peripheral blood, presence of immune complexes that hide HBsAg, and interference by other viruses such as HCV and HIV. Molecular mechanisms of HBV virus in HBsAg-negative individuals are not fully understood, however, viral mutations seem a very significant factor.

The B[b]F RARs were derived for PAH concentrations measured at stacks and sampling stations in the vicinity of two Söderberg aluminum horizontal stud smelters (HSSs). The samples collected were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography using UV and fluorescence detection. A total of 15 PAHs were analyzed, but, due to the inefficiency of the sampling method used in collecting gaseous PAHs, only particulate PAHs were considered. Comparisons between the B[b]F RARs obtained simultaneously at the source (stack) and those obtained at sampling stations at the two smelters showed that B[b]F degrades more slowly than or at the same rate as most other particulate PAHs monitored. Twenty-three months of urban sampling in the vicinity of one of the aluminum HSSs are also presented, and the results indicate that B[b]F is more stable than all other particulate PAHs investigated.

However, its role in liver transplant recipients with acute rejection has never been well elucidated. Seventeen liver transplant recipients with acute rejection and 25 controls with stable liver function were enrolled in this study to determine the function of granzyme B-producing B cells via flow cytometry. Liver transplant recipients with acute rejection had higher expression of granzyme B in CD19+B cells when compared with controls. Following rejection, the granzyme B production was even elevated although comparison failed to reach significance. The percentages of CD27+granzyme B+CD19+B cells and CD138+granzyme B+CD19+B cells were lower than those of CD27-granzyme B+CD19+B cells and CD138-granzyme B+CD19+B cells in patients with acute rejection, respectively. While the production of CD27 and CD138 was not different between liver transplant recipients with and without acute rejection but increased expression of the two surface markers was observed following rejection. Furthermore, the frequency of granzyme B+CD19+B cells correlated with the level of alanine aminotransferase instead of tacrolimus. CD19+B cells could produce granzyme B when stimulated with IgG + IgM and CpG in the presence of the supernatant of activated CD4+CD25-T cells. In return, granzyme B+CD19+B cells could suppress the proliferation of CD4+CD25-T cells in a granzyme B- and contact-dependent manner.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16493338/,[Liver transplantation for complications of hepatitis B],"In the absence of prophylaxis, there is an elevated risk of virus recurrence after liver transplantation required because of chronic hepatitis B. Regardless of prophylaxis, the risk of recurrence is associated with pre-graft viral load. Long-term prophylaxis by hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) significantly reduces the risk of recurrence, especially if there was no pre-graft viral replication. Use of antiviral agents such as lamivudine, adefovir, tenofovir, and entecavir, control HBV replication in patients with decompensation of cirrhosis while awaiting transplantation and in patients with HBV recurrence post-graft. The risk of emergence of resistant strains limits the use of these antiviral agents. The choice of one or several combined antiviral agents depends on their resistance profiles. Combining antiviral agents and HBIG after transplantation can reduce the risk of HBV recurrence to less than 10%, even in patients with viral replication pre-graft. If there was no detectable viral load pre-graft, withdrawal of HBIG should be considered at some point, while continuing an antiviral agent or after anti-HBV vaccination.",,Bruno Roche;Didier Samuel

Methods: 198 cases with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B were enrolled. Fatty liver, family history of hepatitis B, age, sex, drinking history, HBsAg, HBeAg, HBV-DNA levels, total bilirubin (TBil), CD4/CD8, albumin (ALB), alanine amino transferase (ALT) levels were used as a predictor variables of HBeAg seroconversion. Serological seroconversion of HBeAg was observed at 144 weeks of antiviral therapy. Predictive factors of HBeAg seroconversion was analyzed by logistic regression analysis, and the receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted. Results: HBeAg seroconversion rate was 36.87%. Univariate analysis demonstrated that fatty liver (χ(2) = 35.377; P < 0.001), family history of hepatitis B (χ(2) = 15.687; P < 0.001), the levels of HBeAg (t = 5.034; P < 0.001), HBsAg (t = 3.454; P < 0.001) and HBV-DNA levels (Z = 4.651; P < 0.001) were predictor variables of HBeAg seroconversion. Multivariate analysis showed that family history of hepatitis B, fatty liver, HBV-DNA levels and HBeAg were independent predictors of HBeAg seroconversion. The established logistic regression model for HBeAg through regression analysis was logit P = 9.623-1.228 × family history of hepatitis B - 1.726 × fatty liver - 0.764 × HBV-DNA levels - 0.146 × HBeAg and area under curve was 0.875.

Rat marginal zone B cells (MZ-B) can be distinguished from other B cells, e.g. recirculating follicular B cells (RF-B), by several phenotypic characteristics. Typically MZ-B cells are surface (s)IgMhi, sIgDlo and CD45R(B220)lo, whereas RF-B cells are sIgMlo, sIgDhi and CD45Rhi. In addition, MZ-B cells stain strongly with HIS57, a newly developed monoclonal antibody. The developmental pathway and origin of MZ-B cells are not exactly known. However, previous studies indicate that recirculating (i. e. thoracic duct) B cells can give rise to MZ-B cells. Here the origin of (naive) MZ-B cells was studied using adriamycin (doxorubicin)-induced B cell depletion. Using three-color flow cytometry and immunohistology we show that 2 days after a single i.v. injection of the anti-tumor drug adriamycin only RF-B cells can be detected, while all other B cell subpopulations are depleted, including all bone marrow precursor B cells. By studying the sequential reappearance of various B cell subsets and their precursors after adriamycin administration we show that MZ-B cells and the splenic marginal zone can be detected at a time point at which newly generated B cells (immature B cells) are not yet present. Given the observation that only RF-B cells were present at this time, we conclude that RF-B cells are the immediate MZ-B precursor cells.",,P M Dammers;N K de Boer;G J Deenen;P Nieuwenhuis;F G Kroese

A total of 176 healthy unrelated Croatians were studied using polymerase chain reaction amplification and electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gel in ALFexpress sequencer. Eight HLA-B/D6S2927 haplotypic associations (B*07/D6S2927-4, B*08/D6S2927-3, B*18/D6S2927-3, B*27/D6S2927-1, B*35/D6S2927-5, B*38/D6S2927-4, B*51/D6S2927-2 and B*61/D6S2927-1) showed strong association (P < 0.001, D > 0.5). Among 88 different HLA-B/STR_MICA haplotypic associations, seven combinations (B*07/STR_MICA-A5.1, B*08/STR_MICA-A5.1, B*15/STR_MICA-A5, B*18/STR_MICA-A4, B*27/STR_MICA-A4, B*38/STR_MICA-A9 and B*51/STR_MICA-A6) demonstrated high linkage (D> or = 0.3) with significant P value (P < 0.001). Strong associations were also observed for five HLA-B/D6S2793 haplotypes (B*07/D6S2793-CA17, B*08/D6S2793-CA24, B*13/D6S2793-CA18, B*14/D6S2793-CA14 and B*27/D6S2793-CA14). HLA-B*08/TNFb3 and HLA-B*50/TNFb7 were the strongest associations for HLA-B/TNFb. Nine HLA-B/TNFa combinations were observed with significant P value (B*07/TNFa11, B*08/TNFa2, B*13/TNFa7, B*18/TNFa10, B*27/TNFa6, B*37/TNFa9, B*38/TNFa10, B*39/TNFa13 and B*44/TNFa4). Out of six HLA-B/TNFd haplotypic associations with strong D value, HLA-B*08/TNFd2 and B*37/TNFd3 showed the highest statistical significance (P < 0.0001). These results provide data on the region around the HLA-B that is very attractive because of its contribution to genetic susceptibility for many HLA-associated diseases and therefore this information will help in all further HLA-B locus-associated disease studies.",,Z Grubić;K Stingl;R Zunec;H Car;E Cecuk-Jelicić;V Brkljacić-Kerhin
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17825452/,Five subgenotypes of hepatitis B virus genotype B with distinct geographic and virological characteristics,"Several hepatitis B virus (HBV) subgenotypes, HBV/A1, A2, Bj and Ba, have been reported with respect to clinical differences among patients infected with these subgenotypes. The population genetics and phylogeography of HBV were investigated based on the complete genome sequences of 484 isolates with 108 from our chronic hepatitis B patients and the remaining from the GenBank database. Besides genotypes A-H (HBV/A-H), five subgenotypes were identified among 169 HBV/B isolates by phylogenetic analysis and nucleotide divergence. There were 27 isolates of subgenotype B(1) (HBV/B(1)) restricted to Japan, 104 isolates of HBV/B(2) with the widest distribution in most Asian countries, 4 isolates of HBV/B(3) restricted to Indonesia, 32 isolates of HBV/B(4) restricted to Vietnam, and 7 isolates of HBV/B(5) restricted to Philippines. HBV/B(2)-B(5) isolates carried a recombination with HBV/C over the precore and core genes. In addition to the characteristics of HBV/B(1)-B(5) at some cis-acting elements, the precore stop-codon mutant (G1896A) was significantly different among HBV/B(1), HBV/B(2), and HBV/B(4) (70.3%, 31.7%, 53.0%, P=0.001), while no such mutation was found in HBV/B(3) and B(5). Among characteristics of the HBV/B(1)-B(5) amino acid sequences, serotype adw (K(122)) was exclusive among HBV/B(1), HBV/B(2), and HB V/B(3) isolates, while serotype ayw (R(122)) was among the HBV/B(4) and HBV/B(5) isolates. Furthermore, distinct variations of T cell and B cell recognition epitopes within surface and core proteins were also found among these subgenotypes. In conclusion, subgenotypes HBV/B(1)-B(5) exhibited distinct geographical distributions, virologic characteristics, and probable clinical implications.",,Wen-Chun Liu;Pham Hoang Phiet;Tzen-Yuh Chiang;Koun-Tem Sun;Kuo-Hsiang Hung;Kung-Chia Young;I-Chin Wu;Pin-Nan Cheng;Ting-Tsung Chang

This complex consists of eight morphs that have been described as separate species and combined in various ways for over a century. We examined the classic B. marmorata type and the type originally described as the species B. bivittata (Mitsukuri, 1912); B. bivittata was combined with B. marmorata by Panning (1944). Several observations and a phylogenetic analysis led us to conclude that B. marmorata and B. bivittata should return to their status as separate species. First, B. marmorata lives in shallow areas with strong currents, and B. bivittata lives on open sand between corals in deeper water. Second, the coloration of B. bivittata is distinct from B. marmorata, and although specimens collected on Yap Island differed from Mitsukuri's original description of B. bivittata, no specimens were collected with coloration intermediate between B. bivittata and B. marmorata. Third, spicules are more highly branched, perforated, and spiked in B. bivittata than in B. marmorata (and, in our study, spicule complexity did not correlate with body size). Finally, our phylogenetic analysis, based on partial nucleotide sequences of 16s, 12s, and COI mitochondrial genes, resulted in a tree--(Pearsonothuria graeffei (Bohadschia marmorata) (B. argus (B. bivittata)))--which shows that B. marmorata and B. bivittata are not even sister species, with B. bivittata more closely related to B. argus. Support for the clades for each Bohadschia species was strong, but the clade containing B. argus and B. bivittata had weaker support. Color and spicule examinations made of preserved B. marmorata-complex specimens from the Indo-Pacific as well as behavioral observations in the field also support the resurrection of B. bivittata.",,Ron Clouse;Daniel Janies;Alexander M Kerr
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23020336/,Properties of the B+-H2 and B+-D2 complexes: A theoretical and spectroscopic study,"The rotationally resolved infrared spectrum of the B(+)-D(2) ion-neutral complex is recorded in the D-D stretch vibration region (2805-2875 cm(-1)) by detecting B(+) photofragments. Analysis of the spectrum confirms a T-shaped equilibrium geometry for the B(+)-D(2) complex with a vibrationally averaged intermolecular bond length of 2.247 Å, around 0.02 Å shorter than for the previously characterised B(+)-H(2) complex [V. Dryza, B. L. J. Poad, and E. J. Bieske, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 130, 12986 (2008)]. The D-D stretch band centre occurs at 2839.76 ± 0.10 cm(-1), representing a -153.8 cm(-1) shift from the Q(1)(0) transition of the free D(2) molecule. A new three dimensional ab initio potential energy surface for the B(+)+H(2) interaction is calculated using the coupled cluster RCCSD(T) method and is used in variational calculations for the rovibrational energies of B(+)-H(2) and B(+)-D(2). The calculations predict dissociation energies of 1254 cm(-1) for B(+)-H(2) with respect to the B(+)+H(2) (j = 0) limit, and 1313 cm(-1) for B(+)-D(2) with respect to the B(+)+D(2) (j = 0) limit. The theoretical approach reproduces the rotational and centrifugal constants of the B(+)-H(2) and B(+)-D(2) complexes to within 3%, and the magnitude of the contraction of the intermolecular bond accompanying excitation of the H(2) or D(2) sub-unit, but underestimates the H-H and D-D vibrational band shifts by 7%-8%. Combining the theoretical and experimental results allows a new, more accurate estimation for the B(+)-H(2) band origin (3939.64 ± 0.10 cm(-1)).",,B L J Poad;V Dryza;A A Buchachenko;J Kłos;E J Bieske
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10980349/,DNA sequencing of HLA-B alleles in Mexican patients with Takayasu arteritis,"Takayasu arteritis (TA) is characterized by a 'pulseless' condition and occurs frequently in young females from Asian and South American countries. It has been associated with Mayor Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes in different populations. Recent data indicate direct participation of HLA-B alleles in the susceptibility to the disease. This fact was explored in an associative study with TA to establish if some region in the exon 2, intron 2 or in the exon 3 of HLA-B alleles is common in the alleles associated with TA and at the same time to know if a specific sequence or an epitope, more than an allele, would be responsible for the susceptibility to this vasculitis. We studied HLA-B alleles of 12 Mexican patients with TA using PCR-SSP and sequencing. The analysis by PCR-SSP in 12 patients showed that five of them showed the B*15 allele, three the B*40 allele and two the B*39 allele, the remaining two presented the B*44 allele. Sequence analysis enabled us to define that the B*39 subtypes are B*3908; B*15 subtypes are B*1510, B*1515, B*1522 and B*1531; and the B*40 subtypes are B*4005 and B*4008. An individual with B*51 (B*5107) and another with B*52 (B*5201) alleles were also identified. The sequences of the intron 2 seem be heterogeneous. Analysis at the 63 and 67 positions of HLA-B alleles showed that 9 of them have similarity in some of these positions with the residues detected in the B*5201 and B*3902 alleles associated with TA in Asian populations. The results indicate that there is heterogeneity in the alleles associated with TA in Mexicans but, in spite of that heterogeneity, the alleles associates can be separated into three groups: B*39, B*15 and B*40, whose subtypes are rare and apparently of recent generation in Mexico, probably by recombination events at intron 2 level. The sequences analysis also shows that most of the alleles detected in the Mexican patients share two epitopes described in the susceptibility alleles in Asian populations, suggesting that these epitopes could be responsible for the susceptibility to develop the disease in spite of the allele in which are found.",,G Vargas-Alarcón;J Zúñiga;R Gamboa;G Hernández-Pacheco;R Hesiquio;D Crúz;D Martínez-Baños;C Portal-Celhay;J Granados;P Reyes

Immunofluorescent staining was performed for CD8 (T cells), CD20 (B cells), CD56 (NK cells), CD68 (macrophages) and MPO (neutrophils). Emperipolesis was observed in 74.0% of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 82.8% of patients with acute hepatitis B (AHB). In emperipolesis, CD8(+) T cell was the main cell type. Patients with emperipolesis in CHB got high scores of inflammatory activity. Among patients with CHB, emperipolesis was present with higher serum ALT, AST and GGT levels. HBV DNA Load in patients with emperipolesis was as 10 times high as those without emperipolesis. HBeAb was significantly correlated with the evidence of emperipolesis. In chronic hepatitis B, emperipolesis was associated with severity of liver injury.

Among the parent hydrocarbons, B[b]F was the most potent tumor initiator, with activity greater than that of B[j]F but less than that of benzo[a]pyrene. B[k]F also showed tumor initiating activity, in contrast to its lack of complete carcinogenic activity on mouse skin. B[b]F-9,10-diol, which can form a bay region dihydrodiol epoxide, was as active as B[b]F. B[j]F-9,10-diol, which would form its dihydrodiol epoxide in a four sided pseudo-bay region, was less active than B[j]F. B[k]F-8,9-diol was inactive. These results, together with parallel metabolic studies, suggest that the formation of bay region dihydrodiol epoxides may not be the major activation mechanism in benzofluoranthene tumorigenesis.",,E J LaVoie;S Amin;S S Hecht;K Furuya;D Hoffmann
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33925851/,One-Time Foliar Application and Continuous Resupply via Roots Equally Improved the Growth and Physiological Response of B-Deficient Oilseed Rape,"Oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) is a high-boron (B)-demanding crop, and initially, normal growing plants might show B deficiency at advanced growth stages on soils with marginal B availability. Hence, we compared the effects of B resupply via roots and leaves on growth and physiological response, and relative expression of B transporters in B-deficient oilseed rape plants. Four-week-old plants initially grown with inadequate B (1 µM B for the first two weeks and 0.25 µM B for the next two weeks) were later grown either as such with 0.25 µM B, with 25 µM B in nutrient solution or foliar sprayed with 7 mL of 30, 60 and 150 mM B solution plant-1 as boric acid. Plants grown with 25 µM B in the nutrient solution from the beginning were included as adequate B treatment. Results showed that B resupply to B-deficient plants via roots and leaves (60 mM B) equally improved root and shoot dry matter, but not to the level of plants grown with adequate B supply. Foliar-applied 150 mM B proved toxic, causing leaf burn but not affecting dry matter. Resupply of B via roots increased B concentration in roots and leaves, while leaf-applied B did so only in leaves. Net carbon assimilation had a positive relationship with dry matter accumulation. Except for the highest foliar B level, B resupply via roots and leaves increased the accumulation of glucose, fructose and sucrose in leaves. Boron-deficient plants showed significant upregulation of BnaNIP5;1 in leaves and roots and of BnaBOR1;2 in roots. Boron resupply via roots reversed the B-deficiency-induced upregulation of BnaNIP5;1 in roots, whereas the expression of BnaBOR1;2 was reversed by both root and foliar B resupply. In leaves, B resupply by both methods reversed the expression of BnaNIP5;1 to the level of B-adequate plants. It is concluded that B resupply to B-deficient plants via roots and leaves equally but partially corrected B deficiency in B. napus grown in hydroponics.",B resupply; B transporters; Brassica napus; boron; foliar application.,Anh Quang Dinh;Asif Naeem;Amit Sagervanshi;Karl H Mühling
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9442373/,Regulation of NF-kappa B activity by I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta stability,"Transcription factor NF-kappa B must be released from cytoplasmic inhibitory molecules (I kappa Bs) in order to move to the nucleus and to activate its target genes. Little is known about the mechanisms regulating the maintenance of constitutive nuclear NF-kappa B in some cell-types and of sustained nuclear NF-kappa B activity after stimulation. Increased turnover has been implicated in the regulation of constitutive NF-kappa B activity in mature B cells. We therefore compared the turnover of I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta in mature B cells and HeLa cells. Both proteins display a high turnover in B cells although I kappa B beta is considerably more stable than I kappa B alpha. The half-life of both inhibitors is increased in HeLa cells. In contrast, all other NF-kappa B/I kappa B molecules tested are relatively stable in both cell-types. The elevated turnover of endogenous I kappa B alpha in Namalwa cells is inhibited by a proteasome inhibitor and thus seems to be driven by the same degradation machinery as the slower turnover in non-B cells. Furthermore, we investigated the processes involved in persistent activation of NF-kappa B. TNF-alpha signaling leads to a rapid depletion of cellular I kappa B beta pools. I kappa B alpha is efficiently resynthesized whereas I kappa B beta levels stay low for a prolonged time. NF-kappa B binding activity can be detected for several hours after stimulation. We found that removal of the TNF-alpha containing medium causes a rapid decrease in nuclear NF-kappa B. A phosphoform of newly synthesized I kappa B alpha is visible when degradation by the proteasome is inhibited and new I kappa B alpha displays the same properties regarding phosphorylation and degradation in response to a second inducer. There is no significant difference in the turnover of pre- and post-inductive I kappa B alpha. These observations suggest that resynthesis of I kappa B alpha and removal of the stimulus are obligatory steps for the inactivation of nuclear NF kappa B.",,D Krappmann;C Scheidereit

B/C2-A shares the same domain structure as the factor B and C2 complement components of vertebrates reported so far and shows a close similarity to zebrafish B and medaka fish B/C2. These teleost sequences show almost the same degree of similarity to C2 and B of higher vertebrates. In contrast, B/C2-B has a novel structural feature in that it contains four short consensus repeat modules and does not have a close relative upon phylogenetic analysis. Northern blotting revealed the presence of two transcripts with different sizes for both the B/C2-A and B/C2-B in the hepatopancreas of the carp. Southern blotting suggested the presence of multiple genes for B/C2-A and a single gene for B/C2-B. Although structural features of B/C2-B are slightly more C2-like than B-like, B/C2-B has a crucial amino acid substitution in the serine protease domain, which makes it unlikely that B/C2-B functions as a C3 convertase.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8164680/,Enhanced I kappa B alpha degradation is responsible for constitutive NF-kappa B activity in mature murine B-cell lines,"Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) is a ubiquitous transcription factor which binds to decameric DNA sequences (kappa B sites) and regulates transcription of multiple genes. The activity of NF-kappa B is regulated by an inhibitor protein, I kappa B, which sequesters NF-kappa B in the cytoplasm. Release of I kappa B and subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B generally require activating signals. However, in mature murine B cells, the DNA-binding activity of NF-kappa B is constitutively nuclear and activates the Ig kappa gene, a marker for mature B cells. To understand the basis for the constitutive NF-kappa B activation, we examined the properties of NF-kappa B and I kappa B in both pre-B and mature B cells, the regulated and constitutive states, respectively. We found that expression of I kappa B alpha and p105, members of the I kappa B family, and Rel, a member of the NF-kappa B family, is augmented in mature B cells. Both I kappa B alpha and p 105 are associated with NF-kappa B proteins and sequester most of these proteins in the cytoplasm of mature B cells. However, rapid I kappa B alpha dissociation and degradation lead to continuous nuclear translocation of a small fraction of NF-kappa B proteins, which represent the constitutively active NF-kappa B in mature B cells. We estimate that the protease activity is at least 35-fold greater in mature B cells than in pre-B cells. Rapid degradation of I kappa B alpha is directly involved in constitutive NF-kappa B activation, because stabilization of I kappa B alpha by a protease inhibitor causes loss of NF-kappa B activity in mature B cells. These results provide evidence that continuous and rapid degradation of I kappa B alpha in the absence pf external stimuli is causally involved in the constitutive activation of NF-kappa B in mature murine B cells.",,S Miyamoto;P J Chiao;I M Verma

Serum hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in 57% of patients with acute hepatitis B, 67% of those with acute hepatitis B virus-hepatitis delta virus coinfection and 25% of HBsAg carriers with hepatitis delta virus superinfection during the first week after the onset of symptoms. Patients with acute hepatitis B and those with acute hepatitis B virus-hepatitis delta virus coinfection did not differ significantly with respect to the serological profile of hepatitis B virus DNA and final clinical outcome. Within the group of HBsAg carriers with hepatitis delta virus superinfection, all patients who were initially negative for hepatitis B virus DNA developed chronic hepatitis delta virus infection, whereas 3 of the 4 patients with active hepatitis B virus infection at the time of superinfection showed transient inhibition of hepatitis B virus replication followed by termination of hepatitis delta virus infection in two patients.

The study reveals that subtype B strains in China are genetically diverse and can be classified into four distinct subgroups, namely B' (Thai-B), BJ-B (Beijing-B), Pan-B (Pandemic-B), and TW-B (Taiwan-B), according to the origin of the sequences. The BJ-B and TW-B are reported for the first time. Phylogeographic analysis reveals that B' exhibits a nationwide, transprovincial distribution, and is found in 21 provinces in China in this study, whereas the Pan-B, BJ-B, and TW-B lineages are restricted to particular regions. From the same common ancestor of B', there arise two subclusters in which sequences from Yunnan occupy the basal position. The times of the most recent common ancestors (tMRCAs) of B' and BJ-B are estimated to be 1983.6 (1975.9-1990.3) and 1995.3 (1989.6-2000.3), respectively. The skyline plot profile reveals an exponential decrease in median number of effective infections of subtype B in China from 1994 to 2009. The existence of four types of B clades also indicates distinct transmission networks of subtype B, originating from different introduction events at different time points.

In patients who acquire the disease in early life, the complications of chronic hepatitis B continue to occur as a result of prolonged insidious damage to the liver, even in the low viraemic phase. Treatment that ends with hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion with hepatitis B virus DNA levels just below 10(5) copies/ml may not be sufficient. Patients with mild elevation of alanine aminotransferase levels are already at considerable risk of developing complications.

Compared to the patients with HBV genotype C, those with genotype B were of a younger age and had a higher cumulative rate of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion during the initial 6 years of follow-up. The earlier HBeAg seroconversion in the patients with genotype B, however, did not provide them with a benefit in terms of a reduced risk of developing long-term complications. The response to lamivudine therapy was evaluated in 21 patients infected with HBV genotype B (all of subtype Ba) and 61 with genotype C. There were no differences in the virological response to lamivudine therapy, based on the reduction in median logarithmic HBV DNA titer as well as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, normalization of ALT and the rate of HBeAg seroconversion between the patients with genotypes B and C. No differences were noted either, in the frequency of YMDD mutants at week 52 or the cumulative risk of HBV DNA breakthroughs with YMDD mutations during long-term lamivudine therapy (median 37.5 months).

J. Clin. Invest. 64:292-301). In a reexamination of this kindred, we found an abnormal apolipoprotein (apo) B species, apo B-37 (203,000 mol wt), in the plasma lipoproteins of multiple members of the kindred. In affected individuals apo B-37 was found in very low density lipoproteins, along with the normal apo B species, apo B-100 and apo B-48. High density lipoproteins (HDL) also contained apo B-37, but no other apo B species. The first 13 amino-terminal amino acids of apo B-37 were identical to those of normal apo B-100. We utilized a panel of 18 different apo B-specific monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antisera specific for apo B-37 and the thrombin cleavage products of apo B-100 to map apo B-37 in relation to apo B-100, apo B-48, and the thrombin cleavage products of apo B-100. The results of those immunochemical studies indicated that apo B-37 contains only amino-terminal domains of apo B-100. In affected individuals, the majority of apo B-37 in plasma was contained in the HDL density fraction. Within that fraction apo B-37 was found on discrete lipoprotein particles, termed Lp-B37, that had properties distinct from normal HDL particles containing apo A-I.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15457964/,[Management of hepatitis B],"Treatment of chronic hepatitis B needs to consider two aspects. First, a certain proportion of patients will spontaneously undergo a stable remission of the underlying liver disease, i.e. without therapeutic intervention, on occasion of the HBeAg --> anti-HBe seroconversion. Second, all drugs that have been used so far in the treatment of HBV have rarely resulted in the definitive eradication of the viral infection, i.e. a permanent disappearance of HBsAg with development of anti-HBs. Thus, the most reasonable, albeit surrogate endpoint of treatment is the acceleration towards HBeAg --> anti-HBe seroconversion and/or the stable suppression of HBV replication at levels below 500000 copies/ml, which is associated with disappearance of intrahepatic necrosis and inflammation and slowing down of the fibrosis progression. Two drugs are currently available--interferon-alpha and lamivudine--and a third antiviral compound (adefovir dipivoxil) will soon appear in the market.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34539344/,Sustained Baclofen-Induced Activation of GABA B Receptors After Cerebral Ischemia Restores Receptor Expression and Function and Limits Progressing Loss of Neurons,"One important function of GABA B receptors is the control of neuronal activity to prevent overexcitation and thereby excitotoxic death, which is a hallmark of cerebral ischemia. Consequently, sustained activation of GABA B receptors with the selective agonist baclofen provides neuroprotection in in vitro and in vivo models of cerebral ischemia. However, excitotoxic conditions severely downregulate the receptors, which would compromise the neuroprotective effectiveness of baclofen. On the other hand, recent work suggests that sustained activation of GABA B receptors stabilizes receptor expression. Therefore, we addressed the question whether sustained activation of GABA B receptors reduces downregulation of the receptor under excitotoxic conditions and thereby preserves GABA B receptor-mediated inhibition. In cultured neurons subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), to mimic cerebral ischemia, GABA B receptors were severely downregulated. Treatment of the cultures with baclofen after OGD restored GABA B receptor expression and reduced loss of neurons. Restoration of GABA B receptors was due to enhanced fast recycling of the receptors, which reduced OGD-induced sorting of the receptors to lysosomal degradation. Utilizing the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model of cerebral ischemia, we verified the severe downregulation of GABA B receptors in the affected cortex and a partial restoration of the receptors after systemic injection of baclofen. Restored receptor expression recovered GABA B receptor-mediated currents, normalized the enhanced neuronal excitability observed after MCAO and limited progressive loss of neurons. These results suggest that baclofen-induced restoration of GABA B receptors provides the basis for the neuroprotective activity of baclofen after an ischemic insult. Since GABA B receptors regulate multiple beneficial pathways, they are promising targets for a neuroprotective strategy in acute cerebral ischemia.",GABAB receptor; MCAO; OGD; baclofen; cerebral ischemia; neuroprotection.,Mohammad Hleihil;Markus Vaas;Musadiq A Bhat;Karthik Balakrishnan;Dietmar Benke

In this paper, we report on the generation of mice with decreased amounts of NMHC-B. First, we generated B(DeltaI)/B(DeltaI) mice by replacing a neural-specific alternative exon with the PGK-Neo cassette. This resulted in decreased amounts of NMHC-B in all tissues, including a decrease of 88% in the heart and 65% in the brain compared with B(+)/B(+) tissues. B(DeltaI)/B(DeltaI) mice developed cardiac myocyte hypertrophy between 7 months and 11 months of age, at which time they reexpressed the cardiac beta-MHC. Serial sections of B(DeltaI)/B(DeltaI) brains showed abnormalities in neural cell migration and adhesion in the ventricular wall. Crossing B(DeltaI)/B(DeltaI) with B(+)/B(-) mice generated B(DeltaI)/B(-) mice, which showed a further decrease of approximately 55% in NMHC-B in the heart and brain compared with B(DeltaI)/B(DeltaI) mice. Five of 8 B(DeltaI)/B(-) mice were born with a membranous ventricular septal defect. Moreover, 5 of 5 B(DeltaI)/B(-) mice developed myocyte hypertrophy by 1 month; B(DeltaI)/B(-) mice also reexpressed the cardiac beta-MHC. More than 60% of B(DeltaI)/B(-) mice developed overt hydrocephalus and showed more severe defects in neural cell migration and adhesion than did B(DeltaI)/B(DeltaI) mice.
