https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32323265/,B Cell Development and Maturation,"Since the identification of B cells in 1965 (Cooper et al. 1965), three has been tremendous progress in our understanding of B cell development, maturation and function. A number of B cell subpopulations, including B-1, B-2 and regulatory B cells, have been identified. B-1 cells mainly originate from the fetal liver and contain B-1a and B-1b subsets. B-2 cells are derived from the bone marrow (BM) and can be further classified into follicular B (FOB) and marginal zone B (MZB) cells. Regulatory B cells (Bregs) function to suppress immune responses, primarily by production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. B cell tolerance is established at several checkpoints, during B cell development in the BM (central tolerance) as well as during B cell maturation and activation in the periphery (peripheral tolerance). This chapter will focus on the regulation of important processes during the development and maturation of B-1 and B-2 cells.",B-1; Follicular B; Ig gene; Marginal zone B; V(D)J recombination.,Ying Wang;Jun Liu;Peter D Burrows;Ji-Yang Wang
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26576083/,Hepatitis B virus burden in developing countries,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has shown an intermediate or high endemicity level in low-income countries over the last five decades. In recent years, however, the incidence of acute hepatitis B and the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen chronic carriers have decreased in several countries because of the HBV universal vaccination programs started in the nineties. Some countries, however, are still unable to implement these programs, particularly in their hyperendemic rural areas. The diffusion of HBV infection is still wide in several low-income countries where the prevention, management and treatment of HBV infection are a heavy burden for the governments and healthcare authorities. Of note, the information on the HBV epidemiology is scanty in numerous eastern European and Latin-American countries. The studies on molecular epidemiology performed in some countries provide an important contribution for a more comprehensive knowledge of HBV epidemiology, and phylogenetic studies provide information on the impact of recent and older migratory flows.",Chronic hepatitis; Developing countries; Hepatitis B virus; Molecular epidemiology; Prevention.,Rosa Zampino;Adriana Boemio;Caterina Sagnelli;Loredana Alessio;Luigi Elio Adinolfi;Evangelista Sagnelli;Nicola Coppola

Many viral factors, such as viral load, genotype, and specific viral mutations, are known to affect disease progression. HBV reverse transcriptase does not have a proofreading function, therefore, many HBV genotypes, sub-genotypes, mutants, and recombinants emerge. Differences between genotypes in response to antiviral treatment have been determined. To date, 10 HBV genotypes, scattered across different geographical regions, have been identified. For example, genotype A has a tendency for chronicity, whereas viral mutations are frequently encountered in genotype C. Both chronicity and mutation frequency are common in genotype D. LC and progression to HCC are more commonly encountered with genotypes C and D than the other genotypes. Pathogenic differences between HBV genotypes explain disease intensity, progression to LC, and HCC. In conclusion, genotype determination in CHB infection is important in estimating disease progression and planning optimal antiviral treatment.",Anti-viral therapy; Chronic hepatitis B; Genotypes; Hepatitis B virus; Viral mutation.,Mustafa Sunbul

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29895151/,Hepatitis B virus vaccine breakthrough infection: surveillance of S gene mutants of HBV,"Hepatitis B (HB) is a worldwide public health problem, closely related with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The implementation of universal hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination programs has led to significant reduction in incidence of acute and chronic HB, liver cirrhosis and HCC. However, this success is now being threatened by the discovery of HBV vaccine breakthrough infection caused by the S gene mutants of HBV, high maternal viral load and virus-induced immunosuppression. An alteration in the antigenicity and immunogenicity of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) due to S gene mutations may compromise detection of HBsAg (diagnosis-escape mutants), treatment with hepatitis B-specific immunoglobulin (HBIG), and even cause infections in individuals who are antihepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) antibody-positive after immunization (vaccine-escape mutants). By surveilling for S gene mutants of HBV among vaccinated population, we will have a better understanding of the mechanism of HBV vaccine breakthrough infection; potentially providing new ideas for designing better diagnostic assays and effective vaccines for prevention and treatment of HBV. This review attempts to briefly summarize the status and role of S gene mutations, B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitope mutants, and surveillance of mutant HBV variants in a hospital setting.",HBV vaccine breakthrough infection; S gene; mutants; surveillance..,Y Qin;P Liao
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12699402/,Recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B): a review of its immunogenicity and protective efficacy against hepatitis B,"Engerix-B (Hep-B[Eng]) is a noninfectious recombinant DNA vaccine containing hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). It is produced from genetically engineered yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Intramuscular Hep-B(Eng) [0-, 1-, 6-month schedule] has excellent immunogenicity in healthy neonates and infants, children, adolescents and adults, with seroprotection rates of 85-100% seen approximate, equals 1 month after the final dose of vaccine; seroprotection was defined as an antibody against HBsAg (anti-HBs) titre of > or =10 IU/L. The use of alternative Hep-B(Eng) immunisation schedules (e.g. a 0-, 1-, 2-, 12-month schedule in neonates and infants, 0-, 12-, 24-month or two-dose schedules in children and adolescents, and accelerated schedules in adults) have also been associated with high rates of seroprotection. Seroprotection rates were generally similar with Hep-B(Eng) and the recombinant vaccine Recombivax HB (Hep-B[Rax]) or plasma-derived vaccines (PDVs) approximate, equals 1 month after the final dose (although anti-HBs geometric mean titres were significantly higher with Hep-B[Eng] than with Hep-B[Rax]). One month after the final dose, adults had significantly higher seroprotection rates with the recombinant triple-antigen vaccine Bio-Hep-B (Hep-B[Bio]) than with Hep-B(Eng), although seroprotection rates in healthy infants were similar with Hep-B(Eng) and Hep-B(Bio). Hep-B(Eng) had excellent immunogenicity in several groups considered at high risk of acquiring hepatitis B (e.g. neonates born to hepatitis B carrier mothers and healthcare workers). The immunogenicity of Hep-B(Eng) was reduced in patients with conditions associated with impaired immune function (e.g. patients undergoing haemodialysis or being treated for malignancy), although it had good immunogenicity in patients with diabetes mellitus.Hep-B(Eng) had excellent protective efficacy against HBsAg carriage in healthy infants and children, and in neonates born to hepatitis B carrier mothers (protective efficacy of 95-99%). Hep-B(Eng) also demonstrated good protective efficacy in a number of other high-risk groups. Hep-B(Eng) is generally well tolerated with a tolerability profile similar to that of Hep-B(Rax), Hep-B(Bio) and PDVs. In conclusion, Hep-B(Eng) is a well established, highly immunogenic hepatitis B vaccine with good tolerability and excellent protective efficacy; it offers flexibility through a variety of immunisation schedules. In addition, it appears that Hep-B(Eng) confers immunity for at least 10 years. Hep-B(Eng) has an important role in mass vaccination campaigns against hepatitis B, as well as in groups considered at high risk of acquiring hepatitis B.",,Gillian M Keating;Stuart Noble
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31608073/,Toward a Functional Cure for Hepatitis B: The Rationale and Challenges for Therapeutic Targeting of the B Cell Immune Response,"The central role of the cellular immune response in the control and clearance of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been well-established. The contribution of humoral immunity, including B cell and antibody responses against HBV, has been investigated for a long time but has attracted increasing attention again in recent years. The anti-HBs antibody was first recognized as a marker of protective immunity after the acute resolution of the HBV infection (or vaccination) and is now defined as a biomarker for the functional cure of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). In this way, therapies targeting HBV-specific B cells and the induction of an anti-HBs antibody response are essential elements of a rational strategy to terminate chronic HBV infection. However, a high load of HBsAg in the blood, which has been proposed to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance, represents a major obstacle to curing CHB. Long-term antiviral treatment by nucleoside analogs, by targeting viral translation by siRNA, by inhibiting HBsAg release via nucleic acid polymers, or by neutralizing HBsAg via specific antibodies could potentially reduce the HBsAg load in CHB patients. A combined strategy including a reduction of the HBsAg load via the above treatments and the therapeutic targeting of B cells by vaccination may induce the appearance of anti-HBs antibodies and lead to a functional cure of CHB.",B cell response; chronic hepatitis B; functional cure; hepatitis B virus; therapeutic vaccine.,Zhiyong Ma;Ejuan Zhang;Shicheng Gao;Yong Xiong;Mengji Lu

HBV causes chronic infection in patients and can lead to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and other severe liver diseases. Thus, understanding HBV-related pathogenesis is of particular importance for prevention and clinical intervention. HBV surface antigens are indispensable for HBV virion formation and are useful viral markers for diagnosis and clinical assessment. During chronic HBV infection, HBV genomes may acquire and accumulate mutations and deletions, leading to the expression of defective HBV surface antigens. These defective HBV surface antigens have been found to play important roles in the progression of HBV-associated liver diseases. In this review, we focus our discussion on the nature of defective HBV surface antigen mutations and their contribution to the pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis B.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27107897/,A historical perspective on the discovery and elucidation of the hepatitis B virus,"The discovery in 1965 of the ""Australia antigen,"" subsequently identified as the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), was such a watershed event in virology that it is often thought to mark the beginning of hepatitis research, but it is more accurately seen as a critical breakthrough in a long effort to understand the pathogenesis of infectious hepatitis. A century earlier, Virchow provided an authoritative explanation of ""catarrhal jaundice,"" which did not consider an infectious etiology, but the transmission of jaundice by human serum was clearly identified in two outbreaks in 1885, and the distinction between ""infectious"" and ""serum"" hepatitis was recognized by the early 1920s. The inability to culture a virus or reproduce either syndrome in laboratory animals led to numerous studies in human volunteers; by the end of World War II, it was known that the diseases were caused by different filterable agents, and the terms ""hepatitis A"" and ""B"" were introduced in 1947 (though some long-incubation cases then designated B must in retrospect have been hepatitis C). The development of a number of liver function tests during the 1950s led to the recognition of anicteric infections and the existence of chronic carriers, but little more could be done until an infectious agent had been identified. Once Blumberg and colleagues had found a specific viral marker, the vast amount of accumulated epidemiologic and clinical data, together with huge numbers of stored serum samples, enabled rapid progress in understanding hepatitis B, and revealed the existence of a vast population of chronically infected people in Asia, Oceania and Africa. In this article, we place the identification of the Australia antigen within the historical context of research on viral hepatitis. Following a chronological review from 1865 to 1965, we summarize how the discovery led to improved safety of blood transfusion, the development of a highly effective vaccine and the eventual identification of the hepatitis C, D and E viruses.

Hepatitis B virus infection in transplant procedures other than liver is a major concern because it can be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after transplant. Due to the increased risk of hepatic complications, such as fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis or histologic deterioration after transplant, systematic use of nucleoside or nucleotide analogues shortly before or at the time of transplant is recommended (tenofovir or entecavir are preferable to lamivudine) in all patients, whatever the baseline histologic evaluation. Sustained viral suppression may result in regression of fibrosis, which in turn may lead to decreased disease-related morbidity and improved survival. Finally, due to the high mortality after nonliver transplant procedures, decompensated cirrhosis from chronic hepatitis B should be considered as a contraindication to nonliver transplant but an indication to combined organ transplant (ie, liver-kidney transplant). Because of the high prevalence of hepatitis B virus exposure in allograft donors and recipients, hepatitis B virus status must be considered during organ allocation.

Here, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for B cell hyperactivation during HBV infection. Peripheral CD19+ B cells isolated from 4 CHB patients and 4 healthy volunteers were analysed by RNA sequencing. A total of 1401 differentially expressed genes were identified from B cell transcriptome of CHB patients vs healthy volunteers. We found that B cells from CHB patients were functional impaired, with increased TLR4 expression, activated NF-κB pathway and altered mitochondrial function. The expression of B cell activation-related genes, including TLR4, was further validated using additional clinical samples. To further verify the role of TLR4 in B cell activation during CHB, B cell phenotypes were determined in wild-type (WT) and TLR4-/- HBV-carrier mice. Hyperactivated B cell and TLR4 signalling pathway were observed in WT HBV-carrier mice, while TLR4 ablation failed to induce B cell hyperactivation, and downstream MyD88 and NF-κB were also not altered.

An increase in the hydrophilicity was observed after treatment of non-charged isoporous membranes from PS-b-P4VP-b-PSMA, through acidic hydrolysis of the hydrophobic poly(solketal methacrylate) PSMA block into a hydrophilic poly(glyceryl methacrylate) PGMA block, which contains two neighbored hydroxyl (-OH) groups per repeating unit. For the first time, PS-b-P4VP-b-PSMA triblock terpolymers with varying compositions were successfully synthesized by sequential living anionic polymerization. Composite membranes of PS-b-P4VP-b-PSMA and PS-b-P4VP-b-PGMA triblock terpolymers with ordered hexagonally packed cylindrical pores were developed. The morphology of the membranes was studied with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). PS-b-P4VP-b-PSMA triblock terpolymer membranes were further treated with acid (1 M HCl) to get polystyrene-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine)-b-poly(glyceryl methacrylate) (PS-b-P4VP-b-PGMA). Notably, the pristine porous membrane structure could be maintained even after acidic hydrolysis. It was found that membranes containing hydroxyl groups (PS-b-P4VP-b-PGMA) show a stable and higher water permeance than membranes without hydroxyl groups (PS-b-P4VP-b-PSMA), what is due to the increase in hydrophilicity. The membrane properties were analyzed further by contact angle, protein retention, and adsorption measurements.","acidic hydrolysis; isoporous membrane; non-solvent-induced phase separation (NIPS), ultrafiltration; self-assembly; triblock terpolymer.",Sarah Saleem;Sofia Rangou;Clarissa Abetz;Volkan Filiz;Volker Abetz

Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) results in the development of significant clinical outcomes such as liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which are associated with high mortality rates. HBV is a non-cytopathic virus, with the host's immune response responsible for the associated liver damage. Indeed, HBV appears to be a master of manipulating and modulating the immune response to achieve persistent and chronic infection. The HBV precore protein or hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) is a key viral protein involved in these processes, for instance though the down-regulation of the innate immune response.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15756147/,Natural history of hepatitis B,"The natural course of hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronic infection is variable, ranging from an inactive HBsAg carrier state to a more or less progressive chronic hepatitis, potentially evolving to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Chronic hepatitis may present as typical HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B or HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B. HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis is due to wild type HBV; it represents the early phase of chronic HBV infection. HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis is due to a naturally occurring HBV variant with mutations in the precore or/and basic core promoter regions of the genome; it represents a late phase of chronic HBV infection. The latter form of the disease has been recognized as increasing in many countries within the last decade and it represents the majority of cases in many countries. HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B is generally associated with a more severe liver disease with a very low rate of spontaneous disease remission and a low sustained response rate to antiviral therapy. Longitudinal studies of patients with chronic hepatitis B indicate that, after diagnosis, the 5-year cumulative incidence of developing cirrhosis ranges from 8-20%. Morbidity and mortality in chronic hepatitis B are linked to evolution to cirrhosis or HCC. The 5-year cumulative incidence of hepatic decompensation is approximately 20%. The 5-year probability of survival is approximately 80-86% in patients with compensated cirrhosis. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis have a poor prognosis (14-35% probability of survival at 5 years).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23286861/,Management of acute hepatitis B and reactivation of hepatitis B,"The natural course of hepatitis B virus infection and the resulting hepatic injury is determined by the degree of virus replication and the intensity of host immune response. Upon exposure to hepatitis B virus (HBV), individuals with a vigorous and broad immune response develop acute self-limited infection, which may result in acute hepatitis. However, with stringent testing for HBV and universal precautions, acute HBV is rather rare. Reactivation of HBV most often presents as acute hepatitis B (AVH-B) and clinically, it is difficult to differentiate AVH-B from reactivation of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and it requires a high index of suspicion. In the presence of high HBV DNA (>2 × 10(4) IU/ml) underlying liver disease should be investigated by liver biopsy, endoscopy and/or imaging. The degree of liver failure often depends on the severity of acute insult and the stage of underlying chronic liver disease. Mutations in the HBV genome, immunosuppressive therapy and viral or drug induced injury are common causes of reactivation. As most patients with AVH-B resolve the infection spontaneously, antiviral therapy is not indicated in them. However, the use of a potent oral nucleoside(tide) analogue is necessary as soon as possible in patients with CHB reactivation. Liver transplantation should be considered in patients who develop liver failure secondary to severe acute exacerbation.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9824778/,Nuclear factor kappa B: important transcription factor and therapeutic target,"Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) is an ubiquitous rapid response transcription factor in cells involved in immune and inflammatory reactions, and exerts its effect by expressing cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, growth factors, and immunoreceptors. In this manner, NF-kappa B contributes to immunologically mediated diseases such as allograft rejection, rheumatoid arthritis, and bronchial asthma. The prototypic inducible form of NF-kappa B is a heterodimer composed of NF-kB1 and RelA, which both belong to the NF-kappa B/Rel family of proteins. Inactive NF-kappa B is present in the cytoplasm complexed with an inhibitory protein, I kappa B. NF-kappa B is activated by a number of incoming signals from the cell surface. Released from I kappa B inhibition, NF-kappa B translocates into the nucleus and binds to the kappa B motif of the target gene. The NF-kappa B activation process can be inhibited by pharmacologic agents at each activation step. Glucocorticoids inhibit NF-kappa B by directly associating with NF-kappa B or by upregulating I kappa B expression. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus prevent NF-kappa B activation by inhibiting the action of calcineurin, a phosphatase that indirectly induces I kappa B degradation. Deoxyspergualin inhibits NF-kappa B by blocking its nuclear translocation. Aspirin and salicylates inhibit upstream events inducing I kappa B phosphorylation. Tepoxalin and antioxidants inhibit NF-kappa B activation by influencing the redox state of the cell.

The data show that phenotypically B-1a and B-1b cells are essentially identical, distinguished only by the presence or absence of the CD5 antigen. Functionally no differences between the two populations have yet been identified. Both produce anti-PtC antibodies, a specificity not observed in conventional B cells. Both produced high levels of IgM as measured in adoptive transfer experiments. Developmentally, B-1a and B-1b cells are indistinguishable with respect to generation from progenitors present in fetal liver and omentum, feedback regulation of new B-1a and B-1b cells from bone marrow, self-replenishment from Ig+ cells following adoptive transfer, and the generation of clonal populations. The major difference in the two populations is seen in the development of B-1a and B-1b cells from B220- progenitors in the adult bone marrow. Although B220- B-1a progenitors are rare in adult (greater than 6 weeks) bone marrow, the progenitors for B-1b cells persist well into adulthood. Our understanding of B-1b cell ontogeny is at a stage similar to that of B-1a cells five years ago. We have evidence from transfer experiments that strongly suggests the existence of two distinct progenitors for B-1a and B-1b, but we have yet to physically separate these progenitors as Solvansen et al. have done for B-1 and conventional B cells. Furthermore we must determine whether the B-1b cells that develop from fetal liver and bone marrow are functionally and developmentally equivalent to those that develop from adult bone marrow. As with B-1a cells, the role of B-1b cells in the immune system is unclear. Although we have not yet discerned functional differences between B-1a and B-1b, given the recent identification of CD72 (Lyb-2) as the ligand for CD5, it is tempting to speculate that B-1a cells are more involved in B-B cell interactions such as idiotype-anti-idiotype regulation of the early B-cell repertoire and that B-1b cells are more involved in B-T cell interactions.

A lower baseline hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level is a strong predictor of the response to antiviral therapy. HBV genotype A/B patients have better responses to interferon-based therapy than those with genotypes C/D. Regarding the association of HBV mutants with responses to antiviral therapy, current evidence is limited. On-treatment viral suppression is the most important predictor of response to nucleoside analogs. On-treatment hepatitis B surface antigen decline is significantly associated with response to pegylated interferon. In the future, individualized therapy should be based on treatment efficacy, adverse effects, baseline and on-treatment predictors of antiviral therapy.",,Chih-Lin Lin;Jia-Horng Kao

In contrast, those who are infected at birth or early childhood (including the majority of the world's hepatitis B carriers, i.e. Asians) have a prolonged immune tolerance phase followed by a prolonged immune clearance phase. A proportion of these patients have progressive disease after HBeAg seroconversion with HBV DNA <10(4) copies/mL (<2000 IU/mL) and ALT between 0.5 and 2x upper limit of normal. Core promoter mutations may play a part in the development of cirrhosis-related complications.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection may cause hepatic cirrhosis and liver cancer. It is estimated that there are more than 350 million chronic HBV carriers worldwide, of whom approximately one quarter will die of chronic hepatitis B-related liver diseases. HBV is transmitted horizontally through blood and blood products or by sexual transmission, and vertically from mother to infant. Perinatal infection is the predominant mode of transmission in countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriage, and perinatal transmission leads to high rates of chronic infection. Therefore, it is important to prevent the mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HBV. Research has shown that pregnant women with high HBV DNA levels have an increased risk of MTCT. However, most of the obstetrics guidelines do not make a distinction between pregnant women with high HBV DNA levels and those who are HBsAg positive only.

The hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) contains the large (L), middle (M), and small (S) surface proteins. The L protein consists of the S protein, preS1, and preS2. In HBsAg, the preS domain (preS1 + preS2) plays a key role in the infection of hepatocytic cells by HBV and has several immunogenic epitopes. Based on these characteristics of preS, several preS-based diagnostic and therapeutic materials and systems have been developed. PreS1-specific monoclonal antibodies (e.g., MA18/7 and KR127) can be used to inhibit HBV infection. A myristoylated preS1 peptide (amino acids 2-48) also inhibits the attachment of HBV to HepaRG cells, primary human hepatocytes, and primary tupaia hepatocytes. Antibodies and antigens related to the components of HBsAg, preS (preS1 + preS2), or preS1 can be available as diagnostic markers of acute and chronic HBV infections. Hepatocyte-targeting delivery systems for therapeutic molecules (drugs, genes, or proteins) are very important for increasing the clinical efficacy of these molecules and in reducing their adverse effects on other organs. The selective delivery of diagnostic molecules to target hepatocytic cells can also improve the efficiency of diagnosis. In addition to the full-length HBV vector, preS (preS1 + preS2), preS1, and preS1-derived fragments can be useful in hepatocyte-specific targeting.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23286858/,Treatment of HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B: interferon or nucleoside analogues,"Interferon alpha has restricted efficacy in as much as only a proportion of patients show a response. However, in appropriately selected HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients, sustained suppression of viral replication can be achieved, and HBeAg or even HBsAg seroconversion can be attained. Thus, finite course of interferon alpha can be successful, and offer an advantage to patient. Interferon (IFN) remains a benchmark therapy for chronic hepatitis B. The main advantages of IFN-α over nucleoside analogues are the absence of resistance and the possibility of immune-mediated clearance of hepatitis B. Unfortunately, side effects preclude the use of interferon alpha in substantial proportions of patients, and prolonged maintenance therapy to suppress hepatitis B virus (HBV) is not feasible. Nucleoside analogues are given by mouth, once per day, and the safety, potency and efficacy have improved and facilitated treatment. However, maintenance of long-term suppression is required for the majority of patients. In general, treatment of chronic hepatitis B should target patients with active disease and viral replication, preferably before the signs and symptoms of cirrhosis or significant injury has occurred. Current EASL guidelines suggest that treatment be based on the evaluation of three criteria: Serum aminotransferase levels, serum HBV DNA levels and histological grade and stage. Many questions remain unanswered on the optimal treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B with a nucleoside vs interferon alpha. Both forms of treatment have benefits and the choice should be selected and tailored. Stopping or futility rules can be implemented in patients who fail interferon.

It differs from B*14:13 by one base (103G>T) in exon 2 resulting in a substitution of alanine (A) in B*14:13 to serine (S) in B*14:53. Unique among current HLA-B*14 alleles, B*14:53 and B*14:13 share a motif of 59 bases between positions 361 and 419 in exon 3. This motif is present in numerous HLA-B alleles the commonest overall being B*08:01, suggesting that both B*14:53 and B*14:13 arose from intralocus gene conversion events with B*08:01. Thus, B*14:53 probably arose from B*14:01:01 (which has TCC at codon 11 (S), while B*14:13 arose from B*14:02:01:01 which has GCC at codon 11 (A). Additionally, the two likely B*14:53-bearing and B*14:13-bearing haplotypes are typical of B*14:01:01-bearing and B*14:02:01:01-bearing haplotypes, respectively. Serological testing, using 49 antisera with HLA-B64, or B64, B65 reactivity, showed that the B*14:53 specificity did not react as a B64 (B*14:01) specificity and may appear as a short/weak HLA-B14. This implies that residues additional to S at position 11 are involved in HLA-B64 serological identity; for example, the motif 11S 97W 116F is possessed by B*14:01 and many other B*14 products (and B*39:79 plus some HLA-C products) but not B65 (B*14:02) or the B*14:53 specificity.

In contrast, late or absent HBeAg seroconversion after multiple hepatitis flares accelerates the progression of chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis. Recently, several hepatitis B viral factors predictive of clinical outcomes have been identified. For example, serum HBV DNA level at enrollment is the best predictor of adverse outcomes (cirrhosis, HCC and death from liver disease) in adults with chronic HBV infection. In addition, HBV genotype C, basal core promoter (BCP) mutant and pre-S deletion mutant are associated with increased risk of HCC development. In conclusion, hepatitis B viral factors such as serum HBV DNA level, genotype and mutants have already been clarified to influence disease progression of chronic hepatitis B. Further studies are needed to investigate the pathogenic mechanism of each viral factor.",,Chih-Lin Lin;Jia-Horng Kao
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14638401/,Mutations of the surface protein of hepatitis B virus,"Neutralizing antibodies induced by immunization against hepatitis B infection are targeted to the conformational epitopes of the common a determinant of the surface antigen. However, amino acid substitutions within this region of the surface protein of the virus, particularly in the region of amino acid 137-147 allow replication of hepatitis B virus in vaccinated subjects, since antibodies induced by current vaccines do not recognize crucial changes in the surface antigen domain. The G145R mutant is replication competent and is stable, and it appears to be the most common variant. There is evidence that these mutants may not be detected by current screening tests and diagnostic reagents. Epidemiological monitoring of hepatitis B virus surface mutants is essential.",,Jane N Zuckerman;Arie J Zuckerman

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30924226/,Incidence of development of hepatocellular carcinoma in Japanese patients infected with hepatitis B virus is equivalent between genotype B and C in long term,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes B (HBV/B) and C (HBV/C) are the most prevalent genotypes among Japanese patients with hepatitis. Reportedly, HBV/C infection has been associated with more severe disease progression, manifesting as developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), than HBV/B infection. However, no long-term studies have examined the development of HCC in HBV/B-infected patients in Japan. The aims of our study were to compare the incidence of HCC in HBV/B- or HBV/C-infected patients. A total of 241 patients were followed up among 295 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive carriers. Genotypes of HBV were A in 1% (4/295), B in 61% (179/295), C in 37% (110/295) and D in 1% (2/295) patients, and 96% of HBV/B were infected with subgenotype Bj. The mean age at HCC diagnosis was significantly higher in HBV/B than in HBV/C (67.0 ± 10.0 vs 57.7 ± 8.0 years, P < 0.001). The value of FIB-4 index was significantly higher in HBV/B than in HBV/C (P < 0.01). The rate of HCC was higher in HBV/C than in HBV/B, and a significant difference was observed until the 20-year observation period (P = 0.048). However, thereafter, HCC associated with HBV/B increased, and no significant difference was observed between HBV/B and HBV/C. HCC development was consistently observed even in HBV/B infection, especially among elderly patients with advanced fibrosis compared with HBV/C. HBV/B-infected patients developed HCC later in life, and in the long term, we found no differences in incidence of HCC development rates between these two genotypes.",hepatitis B virus; hepatocellular carcinoma; viral genotypes.,Hiroaki Haga;Takafumi Saito;Kazuo Okumoto;Kyoko Tomita;Tomohiro Katsumi;Kei Mizuno;Taketo Nishina;Hisayoshi Watanabe;Yoshiyuki Ueno
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15481340/,Serologic and molecular diagnosis of hepatitis B virus,"Serologic assays for HBV are the mainstay diagnostic tools for HBV infection. However, the advent of molecular biology-based techniques has added a new dimension to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with chronic HBV infection. Over the past decade, improvements in molecular technology, permitting detection of as few as 10 copies/mL of HBV DNA in serum have led to redefinitions of chronic HBV infection, as well as thresholds for antiviral treatment. As the sensitivity of these molecular techniques continues to improve, the challenge will be to standardize these assays as well as define clinically significant levels of HBV replication.",,Julie C Servoss;Lawrence S Friedman
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18284180/,"Diagnosis, diagnostic tests and monitoring of hepatitis B virus in monoinfected and HIV-coinfected patients","With the recent approval of several drugs for the management of chronic hepatitis B, the proper diagnosis and classification of this disease is necessary to determine if therapy is needed and what the best treatment options are. The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B relies on serological testing, and disease stage is further characterized with HBV DNA levels and an assessment of liver disease through biopsy or non-invasive methods. A regular screening protocol is necessary for patients with chronic hepatitis B to monitor the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients receiving treatment also need regular monitoring for response to determine if a different therapeutic regimen is needed or if drug-resistant variants are being selected. This review discusses the various tests for hepatitis B diagnosis and for monitoring disease progression and treatment response. In addition, noninvasive methods for classifying liver disease stage are discussed, as are special considerations that are needed for individuals coinfected with HIV.",,Chloe L Thio
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23749665/,Global perspective on the natural history of chronic hepatitis B: role of hepatitis B virus genotypes A to J,"Clinical outcomes of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection vary widely. In addition to host factors, several viral factors including HBV genotype, viral load, specific viral mutations and quantitative HBsAg levels, have been associated with disease outcomes. Among viral factors, HBV genotype correlates with not only the clinical outcomes, but also with the response to interferon treatment. Currently, 10 HBV genotypes have been identified. Compared with genotype A and B cases, patients with genotypes C and D have lower rates and usually delayed onset of spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion. HBV-genotype C has a higher frequency of basal core promoter (BCP) A1762T/G1764A mutation and preS deletion, and a higher viral load than genotype B. Similarly, genotype D has a higher prevalence of BCP A1762T/G1764A mutation than genotype A. These observations suggest pathogenic differences between HBV genotypes. Genotyping of HBV can help practicing physicians identify chronic hepatitis B patients at risk of disease progression.",,Chun-Jen Liu;Jia-Horng Kao
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28738453/,[Promoting hepatitis B elimination and laying emphasis on its economics evaluation],"WHO has developed and issued global hepatitis B elimination program. Continuing hepatitis B immunization and conducting community based antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis B are the most important strategies for hepatitis B elimination. According to the estimation of related cost by WHO, the cost of antiviral therapy would be very high. Great achievement has been made in hepatitis B immunization in China, but the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B is high. Elimination of hepatitis B needs a large amount of public resource, posing serious challenge to public health policy making. Economics research on hepatitis B prevention and treatment can provide evidence and technical support for hepatitis B elimination.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22155900/,"HBV genotypes: relevance to natural history, pathogenesis and treatment of chronic hepatitis B","Although chronic HBV infection is the leading cause of chronic liver disease and death worldwide, there are substantial differences in its clinical courses regarding prevalence, mode of transmission, characteristics of each phase, responses to antiviral therapy, and development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, according to geographical areas (Asia versus Western Europe and North America versus Africa). Furthermore, the clinical course in infected individuals depends on a complex interplay among various factors including viral, host, environmental and other factors. Recently, understanding of molecular characteristics of the prevailing HBV genotypes, frequently accompanied mutations and their clinical implications might explain these geographical differences more pertinently.
