https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29880128/,Artificial Intelligence in Cardiology,"Artificial intelligence and machine learning are poised to influence nearly every aspect of the human condition, and cardiology is not an exception to this trend. This paper provides a guide for clinicians on relevant aspects of artificial intelligence and machine learning, reviews selected applications of these methods in cardiology to date, and identifies how cardiovascular medicine could incorporate artificial intelligence in the future. In particular, the paper first reviews predictive modeling concepts relevant to cardiology such as feature selection and frequent pitfalls such as improper dichotomization. Second, it discusses common algorithms used in supervised learning and reviews selected applications in cardiology and related disciplines. Third, it describes the advent of deep learning and related methods collectively called unsupervised learning, provides contextual examples both in general medicine and in cardiovascular medicine, and then explains how these methods could be applied to enable precision cardiology and improve patient outcomes.",artificial intelligence; cardiology; machine learning; precision medicine.,Kipp W Johnson;Jessica Torres Soto;Benjamin S Glicksberg;Khader Shameer;Riccardo Miotto;Mohsin Ali;Euan Ashley;Joel T Dudley
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30361497/,Computational models in cardiology,"The treatment of individual patients in cardiology practice increasingly relies on advanced imaging, genetic screening and devices. As the amount of imaging and other diagnostic data increases, paralleled by the greater capacity to personalize treatment, the difficulty of using the full array of measurements of a patient to determine an optimal treatment seems also to be paradoxically increasing. Computational models are progressively addressing this issue by providing a common framework for integrating multiple data sets from individual patients. These models, which are based on physiology and physics rather than on population statistics, enable computational simulations to reveal diagnostic information that would have otherwise remained concealed and to predict treatment outcomes for individual patients. The inherent need for patient-specific models in cardiology is clear and is driving the rapid development of tools and techniques for creating personalized methods to guide pharmaceutical therapy, deployment of devices and surgical interventions.",,Steven A Niederer;Joost Lumens;Natalia A Trayanova

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32284113/,Nuclear Cardiology in Asia,"Nuclear cardiology for patients with ischemic heart disease and cardiac failure is expanding in Asia, although quite heterogeneously. In Asia, Israel showed the highest utilization with more than 1000 scans/100,000 inhabitants a year followed by Korea, Japan, UAE, Turkey, Australia (250-999 scans/100,000). Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, Lebanon, Iran, and Pakistan practiced 60-99 scans/100,000. Most of South East Asian countries, China, India, and Bangladesh practiced 1-50 scans/100,000 per year. Countries in Central Asia, Mongolia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Lao, Myanmar, Nepal, and Bhutan showed limited use or no nuclear cardiology practice. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in Asia was characterized by more frequent use of 201Tl, less use of weight-based 99mTc dosing, and a trend toward a lower rate of stress-only imaging. Accordingly, the effective dose in nuclear cardiology practices was higher than those of the rest of the world. 99Mo-99mTc generators are available in most countries, relying mainly on the global supply chain because there is little supply chain beyond countries within the region. In practice, the threshold values of left ventricular ejection fraction, end-systolic volume, and end-diastolic volume between normal and pathologic states were set based on the regional normal database in China and Japan because these values were dependent on age, gender, and body weight. The purpose of the MPI SPECT study was to evaluate myocardial ischemia in symptomatic patients with chest pain, effects of percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass-graft, and cardiac function in patients with chronic heart failure. The ability of 99mTc-based MPI for predicting hard cardiac events was confirmed in Asian inhabitants with low risk of ischemic heart disease. Human resource development of nuclear medicine professional and public awareness of nuclear medicine is key issues to promote nuclear cardiology in Asia. International organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and academic organizations in the region such as Asia Oceania Federation of Nuclear Medicine and Biology, Asia Regional Cooperative Council for Nuclear Medicine, East Asia Nuclear Medicine Association, and Arab Society of Nuclear Medicine have an important role in addition to national Societies of Nuclear Medicine in each country and region.",,Jun Hatazawa;Durre Sabih;Yaming Li;Prasanta Kumar Pradhan;Diana Paez

Moreover, rule-based expert systems are inefficient in solving complicated medical tasks or for creating insights using big data. Deep learning has emerged as a more accurate and effective technology in a wide range of medical problems such as diagnosis, prediction, and intervention. Deep learning is a representation learning method that consists of layers that transform data nonlinearly, thus, revealing hierarchical relationships and structures. In this review, we survey deep learning application papers that use structured data, and signal and imaging modalities from cardiology.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30338503/,Roots of modern cardiology in Poland,"The aim of the paper was to present the achievements of Polish physicians in the field of heart diseases in the times when cardiology was still not established as a separate branch of medicine, i.e. in the last decades of the 19th and the opening decades of the 20th centuries. The article is based on results previously delivered in historical works of other researchers and on original texts coming from the era which is the subject of the present report. The review focuses on the main topics of scientific investigation related to heart diseases - the subject of interest for physicians who are depicted herein. It should be stressed that only part of their intellectual heritage could be presented, with only a limited selection of names, articles, or books. Nevertheless, even when narrowed in scope, it shows innovativeness in many aspects of practical and scientific approaches to clinical problems. It also brings to our mind times when the dreams of many have wandered around the independence of one's homeland, dreams which finally came true in 1918. From Adam Raciborski, who was fighting in the November Uprising and then was forced to leave Polish soil, to Andrzej Klisiecki, a soldier of the resurrected Polish army, defending his country against the Bolshevik invasion in 1920, the majority of researchers would take a strong patriotic attitude and work for the benefit of society.

Approximately 9 million studies performed yearly in the U.S. alone. As cardiovascular disease remains the largest healthcare problem around the world despite increasing healthcare spending there is growing interest to enhance the use of cost effective diagnostic tools, such as nuclear cardiology. Recent development of technology has seen the addition of hybrid imaging tools such PET/CT and SPECT/CT into the armorial. More data is expected to become available on this subject within the next few years, and we also expect several molecular imaging tests to become available for clinical use. Despite easy availability of these diagnostic tools, cardiac mortality and morbidity in patients with long term diabetes and also in the postoperative setting remains unexpectedly high and emergency department physician are still being sued after patients being discharged with undiagnosed chest pain.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23488162/,[Nuclear cardiology: the present functions and future perspectives],"For the past decade, the diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) has shifted from the traditional model by evaluating coronary artery stenosis with morphological imaging methods to a novel model by focusing on the detection of ischemia for risk stratification. The myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) using stress single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has become the most commonly used stress imaging technique for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with suspected or known CAD. It has got strong supports, including those of the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ACC/AHA/ASNC) and other numerous clinical guidelines. They all stressed that the SPECT MPI is recommended to be used as the ""gate keeper"" to coronary angiography in order to prevent unnecessary intervention test and save the cost. However, in China the introduction and application of nuclear cardiology was late and highly unbalanced. This leads to the lack of understanding of nuclear cardiology in some clinicians, and there often is misunderstanding on correct selection of coronary angiography, cardiac CT, CT coronary angiography and others for diagnosis and treatment of CAD which results in a trend of over-application of these traditional techniques. In this article, we will focus on the status of nuclear cardiology, including SPECT, positron emission tomography (PET) MPI in the patients with CAD for the diagnosis of ischemia, risk stratification and management decision-making, and also compare it with the traditional morphological imaging techniques. In addition, we will briefly introduce the recent advances in cardiac hybrid imaging and molecular imaging.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31679896/,[Exercise testing: New guidelines],"The GERS-P (Exercise Rehabilitation Sports Prevention Group of the French Society of Cardiology) has decided to update current guidelines regarding the practice of EKG stress tests. Since the last update dates from 1997, the GERS judged it necessary to integrate data from new works and advancements made in the last 20 years. Good clinical practices and safety conditions are better defined regarding the structure, location, material, staff competency, as well as convention with hospital structures. The diagnosis of coronary artery disease remains the principal indication for a stress test. Interpretation of the results is crucial - it must be multivariate and provide either a low, intermediate or strong probability of the existence of coronary lesions, taking into account the studied population (risk factors, age, sex and symptoms). We no longer have to talk about a ""positive, negative or litigious"" test. Several new indications for a stress test have been defined for the assessment of cardiac pathologies. With such indications, the use of gas expiration measurements is highly recommended in order to provide a precise prognosis for all the various cardiac pathologies : congenital, ischemic, valvular, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, rhythm and conduction disorders, pacemaker fine-tuning, or pulmonary hypertension. Indications for stress tests and contraindications are defined according to different population subgroups, for instance : athletes, women, children, the elderly, asymptomatic patients, diabetics, hypertensive patients, peripheral arteritis disease patients, or in the context of a non-cardiac surgery pre-op visit. The new guidelines are considerably different from those dating from 1997 and further pinpoint the relevance and importance of an EKG stress test within the arsenal of complementary cardiologic exams. With the improvements made in providing diagnostic value in CAD, as well as better prognostic value for any underlying pathology, the indication for an EKG stress test has extended to all cardiovascular disease.",,Dany Michel Marcadet

The optimal, tailored diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for pulmonary hypertension in the young are rapidly evolving but still face enormous challenges: Healthcare providers need to take the patient's age, development, disease state, and family concerns into account when initiating advanced diagnostics and treatment. Therefore, there is a need for guidance on core and advanced medical training in paediatric pulmonary hypertension. The Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology working group ""pulmonary hypertension, heart failure and transplantation"" has produced this document as an expert consensus statement; however, all recommendations must be considered and applied in the context of the local and national infrastructure and legal regulations.",Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology; Pulmonary hypertension; children; heart disease; young adults.,Hannes Sallmon;Shahin Moledina;Dimpna C Albert;Maurice Beghetti;Rolf M F Berger;Damien Bonnet;Mila Bukova;Martin Koestenberger;Katharina Meinel;Zdenka Reinhardt;Robert M R Tulloh;Daniel de Wolf;Georg Hansmann
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31691759/,Cardiology Training in Brazil and Developed Countries: Some Ideas for Improvement,"Huge variations exist in cardiology training programs across the world. In developing (middle-income) countries, such as Brazil, to find the right balance between training improvements and social and economic conditions of the country may be a difficult task. Adding more training years or different mandatory rotations, for instance, may be costly and not have an immediate direct impact on enhancing patient care or public health. In this text, we compare the Brazilian cardiology training system with other proposals implemented in developed countries from North America and Europe, aiming to point out issues worth of future discussion. Factors such as training rotations and competencies, and program duration and distribution across the countries are presented. The number of first year cardiology trainees per inhabitants is similar between Brazil and the United States (0.24 medical residents/100,000 inhabitants in Brazil and 0.26 medical residents/100,000 inhabitants in the USA). These numbers should be analyzed considering the inequality in training program distribution across Brazil, since most centers are located in the Southeast and South regions. Having more residency programs in distant areas could improve cardiovascular care in these areas. Duration of cardiology Residency Training is shorter in Brazil (two years) in comparison with developed countries (> 3 years). Brazilian residency programs give less emphasis to scientific research and diagnostic methods. Unifying minimum training requirements across the globe would facilitate the development of international learning opportunities and even professional exchange around the world.",,Lucas Colombo Godoy;Michael E Farkouh;Isabela C K Abud Manta;Talia F Dalçóquio;Remo Holanda de Mendonça Furtado;Eric H C Yu;Carlos Gun;José Carlos Nicolau

Initiated by anaesthesiologists, this teaching mode effectively allows a gradual transfer of learning, and has become an essential tool in cardiology teaching. Cardiologists are embracing simulation to master complex techniques in interventional cardiology, to manage crisis situations and unusual complications and to develop medical teamwork. Simulation methods in cardiology include high-fidelity simulators, clinical scenarios, serious games, hybrid simulation and virtual reality. Simulation involves all fields of cardiology: transoesophageal echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, coronary angioplasty and electrophysiology. Beyond purely technical issues, simulation can also enhance communication skills, by using standardized patients, and can improve the management of situations related to the announcement of serious diseases.

At the same time, the evidence continues to mount in support of intensivist staffing to improve both patient outcomes and resource utilization in intensive care units (ICUs). Whereas the vast majority of medical and surgical ICUs are staffed by physicians trained in critical care medicine, that is not commonly the case in coronary care units (CCUs) in this country. Despite that, the breadth and diversity of comorbidities in patients that occupy our CCU beds is continuously growing. No longer is the CCU merely an observation unit for peri-infarction complications, but rather it has truly become an ICU for patients with cardiovascular disease. With this in mind, there becomes a growing need for intensivist-trained cardiologists and a push for the development of critical care training pathways in our cardiovascular fellowship programs.",,Jason N Katz;Aslan T Turer;Richard C Becker

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15181186/,A history of pediatric specialties: the development of pediatric cardiology,"Pediatric cardiology, as a discipline, arose from early descriptive studies of congenital cardiac defects. The development of the stethoscope allowed some clinical diagnoses to be made during life. Cardiology as a medical specialty was limited, mainly, to internists. When Robert Gross ligated a patent ductus in 1938, pediatric cardiology, as a discipline, was born. Physiologic studies, angiography, and the development of extracorporeal circulation allowed congenital cardiac lesions previously considered a curiosity to be diagnosed and treated successfully. The few pediatricians who were interested in cardiology taught themselves, and soon pediatric cardiology training programs developed. By 1961, pediatric cardiology became the first subspecialty board in pediatrics. The past 60 y has brought enormous progress. Cardiac ultrasound, color-flow Doppler, and magnetic resonance imaging have made diagnostic cardiac catheterization almost unnecessary. Instead, interventional cardiac catheterization rapidly developed and is already able to replace surgery in the treatment of a number of cardiac defects. The first 50 y of cardiology has been focused on patient care, education, and clinical research, but the last 10 y has added exciting, basic research discoveries, which are elucidating the cause of cardiac defects with hope for prevention in the future. As a discipline, pediatric cardiology has always required a team-pathologists, physiologists, cardiologists, surgeons, intensivists, interventionists, and anesthesiologists-all playing an important role in the treatment of children with cardiac problems. Today the geneticists, molecular biologists, and other basic scientists are joining the team to ensure an exciting future for pediatric cardiology and the children yet to be born.",,Jacqueline A Noonan

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23030292/,New cell therapies in cardiology,"Even today, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death globally. Cardiological conditions such as myocardial infarction, ischemic injury and chronic cardiomyopathy result in permanent cardiac tissue damage followed by heart failure. Current therapies primarily aim to trigger the pathological remodeling that occurs after cardiac injury and also to reduce risk factors involved in cardiovascular diseases. Animal model studies over the last decade indicate that the systematic administration of autologous and allogeneic stem cells possesses therapeutic potential to improve overall cardiac functions. This evidence robustly indicates that cardiac tissue has the potential to undergo a systematic repair process. The past few years have also witnessed a splurge in clinical research that particularly aims to explore the regenerative properties of the naive stem cells to restore cardiac functions. The mechanisms involved in stem cell therapy remain unclear. The magnitude of benefit demonstrated in animal models is yet to be completely translated into humans. The future of cardiac research will require tangible synchrony between clinicians and basic scientists to unravel the precise mechanism of stem cell therapy. It is also pivotal to define an ideal cell type and a suitable cell delivery technique that provide maximum benefit, while eliminating the grey areas in translational cardiology research.

This rate responds to multiple factors, including a low rate of reperfusion therapy and the absence of a coordinated system of care. Primary angioplasty is the reperfusion method recommended by the guidelines, but requires multiple conditions that are not reached at all times. Early pharmacological reperfusion of the culprit coronary artery and early coronary angiography (pharmacoinvasive strategy) can be the solution to the logistical problem that primary angioplasty rises. Several studies have demonstrated pharmacoinvasive strategy as effective and safe as primary angioplasty ST-elevation myocardial infarction, which is postulated as the choice to follow in communities where access to PPCI is limited. The Mexico City Government together with the National Institute of Cardiology have developed a pharmaco-invasive reperfusion treatment program to ensure effective and timely reperfusion in STEMI. The model comprises a network of care at all three levels of health, including a system for early pharmacological reperfusion in primary care centers, a digital telemedicine system, an inter-hospital transport network to ensure primary angioplasty or early percutaneous coronary intervention after fibrinolysis and a training program with certification of the health care personal.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19664577/,Advances in paediatric interventional cardiology since 2000,"Interventional paediatric and congenital cardiology is expanding at a rapid pace. Validated techniques (such as aortic or pulmonary valve dilatations and occlusion of persistent ductus arteriosus and atrial septal defects) are improving thanks to the use of smaller introducers and sheaths, low-profile balloons and novel devices. Moreover, catheter-based interventions have emerged as an attractive alternative to surgery in other fields: pulmonary valve replacement, balloon and stent implantation for native and recurrent coarctation, and percutaneous closure of ventricular septal defects. On the other hand, percutaneous interventions in the paediatric population may be limited by patient size or the anatomy of the defect. Hybrid approaches involving both cardiac interventionists and surgeons are being developed to overcome these limitations. Based on a better understanding of cardiac development, fetal cardiac interventions are being attempted in order to alter the history of severe obstructive lesions. Finally, some interventional procedures still carry a low success rate-for example, pulmonary vein stenosis, even with the use of conventional stents.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31580205/,Catheter steering in interventional cardiology: Mechanical analysis and novel solution,"In recent years, steerable catheters have been developed to combat the effects of the dynamic cardiac environment. Mechanically actuated steerable catheters appear the most in the clinical setting; however, they are bound to a number of mechanical limitations. The aim of this research is to gain insight in these limitations and use this information to develop a new prototype of a catheter with increased steerability. The main limitations in mechanically steerable catheters are identified and analysed, after which requirements and solutions are defined to design a multi-steerable catheter. Finally, a prototype is built and a proof-of-concept test is carried out to analyse the steering functions. The mechanical analysis results in the identification of five limitations: (1) low torsion, (2) shaft shortening, (3) high unpredictable friction, (4) coupled tip-shaft movements, and (5) complex cardiac environment. Solutions are found to each of the limitations and result in the design of a novel multi-steerable catheter with four degrees of freedom. A prototype is developed which allows the dual-segmented tip to be steered over multiple planes and in multiple directions, allowing a range of complex motions including S-shaped curves and circular movements. A detailed analysis of limitations underlying mechanically steerable catheters has led to a new design for a multi-steerable catheter for complex cardiac interventions. The four integrated degrees of freedom provide a high variability of tip directions, and repetition of the bending angle is relatively simple and reliable. The ability to steer inside the heart with a variety of complex shaped curves may potentially change conventional approaches in interventional cardiology towards more patient-specific and lower complexity procedures. Future directions are headed towards further design optimizations and the experimental validation of the prototype.",Biomedical devices; biomechanical testing/analysis; biomedical instrumentation; cardiovascular implants; cardiovascular system mechanics.,Awaz Ali;Aimee Sakes;Ewout A Arkenbout;Paul Henselmans;Remi van Starkenburg;Tamas Szili-Torok;Paul Breedveld

The use of percutaneous devices is commonplace for the treatment of simple lesions, such as atrial septal defect, patent foramen ovale, patent duct arteriosus, and abnormal vascular connections. There is also substantial experience with device closure of membranous and muscular ventricular septal defects, as well as more complex shunts such as baffle leaks after atrial switch repair and ventricular pseudoaneurysms. An increasing use of covered stents has improved the safety of aortic coarctation, conduit, and branch pulmonary stenosis interventions. Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation now has an established role in the setting of dysfunctional right ventricle-pulmonary artery conduits or failing bioprosthetic pulmonary valves. Many patients remain unsuitable for percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation because of large diameter ""native"" outflow tracts, however, various techniques have emerged and multiple devices are in development to provide solutions for these unique anatomic challenges.

The realization of this goal may, however, not be fully achieved: generic drugs may be underused or misused in comparison to prescription drugs because of a lack of ongoing postgraduate physician education. More importantly, there is little incentive to explore new indications for soon-to-be generic drugs and drugs that are already generic. The failure to explore new indications for soon-to-be and existing generic drugs may result in a missed opportunity to further reduce health care costs. Thus, the apparent savings resulting from the introduction of generic drugs may not be fully realized unless the government and other third-party payers take a more active role in postgraduate drug education and investigation.",,Bertram Pitt

However, there may be little to be gained by frequently monitoring patients with well-treated stable disease. Trials of implantable monitoring-only devices suggest that there is a subgroup of patients that may benefit from such remote monitoring. Remote monitoring is still not widely adopted due to a number of social, technological and reimbursement issues, but this is likely to change rapidly.

In response, a multidisciplinary team approach, which includes clinical pharmacists, is recommended to improve patient outcomes. The purpose of the study was to describe interventions associated with integration of a clinical pharmacist, with an emphasis on pharmacist-generated patient cost avoidance. Methods: This is a prospective observational study detailing pharmacist-initiated interventions within an academic preventive cardiology service. Interventions targeting pharmacotherapy optimization, side effect management, patient education, medication adherence, and cost avoidance were implemented during shared office visits with providers and/or on provider consultation for remote follow-up. Tabulation of cost avoidance was arranged into 2 formats: clinical interventions implemented by the pharmacist and direct patient out-of-pocket expense reduction. Money saved per clinical intervention was extrapolated from data previously published. Patient out-of-pocket expense prior to and after pharmacist involvement was calculated to assess aggregate yearly patient cost savings. Results: Over 12 months the pharmacist intervened on 974 patients, totaling 3725 interventions. Cost avoidance strategies resulted in yearly savings of $830 748 in aggregate-$149 566 from clinical interventions and $681 182 from patient out-of-pocket expense reduction. Monthly patient out-of-pocket expense was reduced from a median (interquartile range) of $217 ($83.5-$347) before to $5 ($0-$18) after pharmacist intervention. Conclusions: Addition of a clinical pharmacist within an academic preventive cardiology clinic generated substantial pharmacotherapy interventions, resulting in significant cost avoidance for patients. The resulting cost avoidance may result in improved medication adherence and clinical outcomes.",cardiovascular disease; cost avoidance; pharmacist; preventive cardiology.,Bruce A Warden;Michael D Shapiro;Sergio Fazio

A large variety of lesions could be opened-up or closed, as the case may be and the results of these interventions were either similar to or better than those reported for the alternative surgical therapy. Indeed, therapeutic catheterization techniques have replaced the conventional surgery for many lesions and are threatening to do so for others.

The impact on populations and health systems is poorly understood. We included data from 990 subjects aged 20 to 64 years from the SALMEX cohort (Salt in Mexico; Mexico City) and determined the prevalence of hypertension and requirement for pharmacological treatment according to both Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure 7 and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2017 guidelines.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10731308/,Interventional cardiology--promises and challenges,"The current explosion in coronary stent use for the treatment of coronary artery disease has helped to better define who really benefits from coronary stenting. It is clear that plain old balloon angioplasty can be at least as efficacious as stenting in certain patient groups. Patients with reference vessel diameter of < 2.5 mm, a small post-stent minimal lumen diameter, lesion length > 30 mm, diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal failure--all associated with a high incidence of diffuse in-stent restenosis--should not be stented routinely. The judicious use of stents in percutaneous revascularization will improve patient outcomes and decrease cost. The progress that has been achieved in coronary stent designs has led to many new questions, such as which patients benefit the most from stenting and whether adjunctive therapies or stent coatings will effectively prevent restenosis. Despite the advances in stent/balloon technology, antiplatelet agents, and interventional operator skill, the problems of in-stent restenosis remain. Novel therapeutic strategies for the management of severe coronary artery disease are evolving rapidly. Radiation therapy shows promise on this front. This therapy may reduce rates of restenosis by inhibiting smooth muscle proliferation and migration. However, important issues regarding the type of radiation and the matter of edge-restenosis are yet to be resolved, and the results of ongoing prospective randomized trials should provide valuable information on the efficacy of this modality. Patients with severe, non-revascularizable coronary artery disease and debilitating symptoms represent another frustrating clinical problem. PMR performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory may improve symptoms of angina in patients with end-stage coronary artery disease. The early results are propitious. Among patients who have undergone this procedure 80-90% have improved from class IV (the most severe chest pain) to class I or II, enabling them to live relatively normal lives. Most investigators believe that PMR may be used only for those who are unsuitable candidates for percutaneous or surgical revascularization. Finally, gene therapy, by stimulating angiogenesis and improving coronary collateral development, may prove to be the most optimal treatment. Each of these strategies is currently under active investigation to confirm the results of the pilot studies, identify patient subgroups likely to respond to therapy, and determine long-term safety. Together with its challenges, the future of interventional cardiology is indeed bright.",,A Roguin;R Beyar

Observational economic evaluations (i.e., economic evaluations in which treatment allocation is not randomized) are prone to confounding bias. Prior reviews published in 2013 have shown that adjusting for confounding is poorly done, if done at all. Although these reviews raised awareness on the issues, it is unclear if their results improved the methodological quality of future work. We therefore aimed to investigate whether and how confounding was accounted for in recently published observational economic evaluations in the field of cardiology. Methods. We performed a systematic review of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and PsycInfo databases using a set of Medical Subject Headings and keywords covering topics in ""observational economic evaluations in health within humans"" and ""cardiovascular diseases."" Any study published in either English or French between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2017, addressing our search criteria was eligible for inclusion in our review. Our protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018112391). Results. Forty-two (0.6%) out of 7523 unique citations met our inclusion criteria. Fewer than half of the selected studies adjusted for confounding (n = 19 [45.2%]). Of those that adjusted for confounding, propensity score matching (n = 8 [42.1%]) and other matching-based approaches were favored (n = 8 [42.1%]). Our results also highlighted that most authors who adjusted for confounding rarely justified their methodological choices. Conclusion. Our results indicate that adjustment for confounding is often ignored when conducting an observational economic evaluation. Continued knowledge translation efforts aimed at improving researchers' knowledge regarding confounding bias and methods aimed at addressing this issue are required and should be supported by journal editors.",cardiology; confounding adjustment; economic evaluations; observational studies; systematic review.,Jason R Guertin;Blanchard Conombo;Raphaël Langevin;Frédéric Bergeron;Anne Holbrook;Brittany Humphries;Alexis Matteau;Brian J Potter;Christel Renoux;Jean-Éric Tarride;Madeleine Durand

Despite the effect of CVD on quality of life, morbidity, and mortality in older adults, individuals aged 75 and older have been markedly underrepresented in most major cardiovascular trials, and virtually all trials have excluded older adults with complex comorbidities, significant physical or cognitive disabilities, frailty, or residence in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. As a result, current guidelines are unable to provide evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of older adults typical of those encountered in routine clinical practice. The objectives of this scientific statement are to summarize current guideline recommendations as they apply to older adults, identify critical gaps in knowledge that preclude informed evidence-based decision-making, and recommend future research to close existing knowledge gaps. To achieve these objectives, a detailed review was conducted of current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and American Stroke Association (ASA) guidelines to identify content and recommendations that explicitly targeted older adults. A pervasive lack of evidence to guide clinical decision-making in older adults with CVD was found, as well as a paucity of data on the effect of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions on outcomes that are particularly important to older adults, such as quality of life, physical function, and maintenance of independence. Accordingly, there is a critical need for a multitude of large population-based studies and clinical trials that include a broad spectrum of older adults representative of those seen in clinical practice and that incorporate relevant outcomes important to older adults in the study design. The results of these studies will provide the foundation for future evidence-based guidelines applicable to older adults and enhance person-centered care of older individuals with CVD in the United States and around the world.",,Michael W Rich;Deborah A Chyun;Adam H Skolnick;Karen P Alexander;Daniel E Forman;Dalane W Kitzman;Mathew S Maurer;James B McClurken;Barbara M Resnick;Win K Shen;David L Tirschwell

Our strengths include: reliance on physiology rather than anatomic definition; standardized and efficient techniques that can be performed in large hospitals and academic centers and in small hospitals and outpatient offices; a large body of evidence-based supporting clinical data; and profitability. We have defined training; committed to quality improvement through development of guidelines and appropriateness criteria; certified physicians and accredited laboratories; and implemented a strong payer advocacy program. Despite success, we find ourselves under attack for not being relevant within the new paradigm of atherosclerosis, being complacent, being used inappropriately, and exposing patients to radiation. We are facing cuts in reimbursement that will make it nearly impossible to provide services. By failing to develop new radiotracers and techniques, we find ourselves measuring only myocardial perfusion. Advances in echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography are providing alternative robust methods and redefining available options for noninvasive cardiovascular imaging.

Assessment of myocardial perfusion and glucose uptake using PET imaging with 18F-FDG for metabolism and 13-N-ammonia or 82-rubidium for coronary flow has proven to be the gold standard for predicting the recovery of regional and global left ventricular (LV) function following revascularization. Patients with viable ischemic myocardium identified by a flow/metabolism mismatch, represent an especially high risk subgroup for hard coronary events within one year, in the absence of myocardial revascularization. The state of the art assessment of myocardial viability in the new millennium is an optimally glucose loaded PET myocardial perfusion/metabolic study. For patients with critically depressed LV function with LVEF <20% at rest assessment of contractile reserve, in addition to 18F-FDG-PET viability imaging, may help predict a favourable surgical outcome.",,George N Chacko
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23453139/,The history of veterinary cardiology,"Throughout civilization, animals have played a pivotal role in the advancement of science and medicine. From as early as 400 BC when Hippocrates recognized that diseases had natural causes, the steadfast advances made by biologists, scientists, physicians and scholars were fueled by timely and important facts and information- much of it gained through animal observations that contributed importantly to understanding anatomy, physiology, and pathology. There have been many breakthroughs and historic developments. For example, William Harvey in the 16th and 17th centuries clarified the importance of the circulatory system, aided by observations in dogs and pigs, which helped to clarify and confirm his concepts. The nineteenth century witnessed advances in physical examination techniques including auscultation and percussion. These helped create the basis for enhanced proficiency in clinical cardiology. An explosion of technologic advances that followed in the 20th century have made possible sophisticated, accurate, and non-invasive diagnostics. This permitted rapid patient assessment, effective monitoring, the development of new cardiotonic drugs, clinical trials to assess efficacy, and multi-therapy strategies. The latter 20th century has marshaled a dizzying array of advances in medical genetics and molecular science, expanding the frontiers of etiologies and disease mechanisms in man, with important implications for animal health. Veterinary medicine has evolved during the last half century, from a trade designed to serve agrarian cultures, to a diverse profession supporting an array of career opportunities ranging from private, specialty practice, to highly organized, specialized medicine and subspecialty academic training programs in cardiology and allied disciplines.",,James W Buchanan

Studies on the evaluation of diagnostic tests in cardiology],"Diagnosis is a complex cognitive process which is characterised by uncertainty. This uncertainty can be managed through specific knowledge in conjunction with probability theory. Studies evaluating diagnostic tests are the best way of building this knowledge. Studies evaluating diagnostic tests have two essential components: the gold standard and the new test. Both components, gold standard and test, are independent measurement process that can be influenced by diverse sources of variability. The comparison between diagnostic and test is essentially a hierarchical procedure. Diagnostic tests are evaluated by their sensitivity, specificity compared to a definitive gold standard. The predictive values and the likelihood ratio test are also used. Sensitivity (the proportion of true positives) and specificity (the proportion of true negatives) are values obtained from a sample and thereby can be considered as the conditional agreement between gold standard and the new test. Kappa coefficients for sensitivity and specificity are useful tools for adjusting both indices. Sensitivity and specificity are non-poblational values, they are estimates of the true values of the study population and can be affected by random error and systematic errors (bias). Confidence intervals are useful for giving an indication of the precision of the point estimates of sensitivity and specificity. A suitable sound design is required to avoiding a biased estimate of sensitivity, likelihood ratio, and predictive values. Finally a list of potential biases is given with methods for minimising these.",,J B Cabello López;P Pozo Rodríguez

This can only be achieved with the close collaboration between cardiologist and the genticist, who knows the legislative framework which governs the performance of genetic tests. During the genetic counselling consultation, and after time for compiling information on the disease and the family, the geneticist gives the most suitable information on the genetic nature of the disease. Depending on the illness, cardiological investigation for the relatives could be advocated. The performance of a molecular test is then discussed, as a function of its feasibility, relevance and the wishes of the patient. The complexity of the medical and psychological stakes varies according to the situation (presymptomatic diagnosis, prenatal diagnosis, diagnostic test, prognostic test) and the condition.

At that time some critics predicted PTCA would remain the hobby of some cardiologists. During the last two decades, however, an explosive proliferation in the number of PTCA procedures has occurred, which soon exceed the number of CABG procedures. As technology has advanced and operator experience has increased, the application of PTCA has expanded from dilatation of simple, concentric single-vessel stenotic lesions to progressively more complex lesions in multivessel disease. Within the last 5 years the minimally invasive cardiac surgery has progressed, which allows the performance of even complex cardiac surgery through small incisions with (port-access technique) or without (MIDCAB technique) cardiopulmonary bypass. The rationale of enthusiastic users of these new techniques leads to improved cosmetic results, less surgical trauma, decreased length of hospital stay, reduced cost, and comparable long-term results with respect to conventional CABG. Similar to the prediction about PTCA two decades ago, some critics say that minimally invasive cardiac surgery would remain the hobby of some cardiac surgeons.",,J W Park

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23021364/,How electricity was discovered and how it is related to cardiology,"We relate the fundamental stages of the long road leading to the discovery of electricity and its uses in cardiology. The first observations on the electromagnetic phenomena were registered in ancient texts; many Greek and Roman writers referred to them, although they provided no explanations. The first extant treatise dates back to the XIII century and was written by Pierre de Maricourt during the siege of Lucera, Italy, by the army of Charles of Anjou, French king of Naples. There were no significant advances in the field of magnetism between the appearance of this treatise and the publication of the study De magnete magneticisque corporibus (1600) by the English physician William Gilbert. Scientists became increasingly interested in electromagnetic phenomena occurring in certain fish, i.e., the so-called electric ray that lived in the South American seas and the Torpedo fish that roamed the Mediterranean Sea. This interest increased in the 18th century, when condenser devices such as the Leyden jar were explored. It was subsequently demonstrated that the discharges produced by ""electric fish"" were of the same nature as those produced in this device. The famous ""controversy"" relating to animal electricity or electricity inherent to an animal's body also arose in the second half of the 18th century. The school of thought of the physicist Volta sustained the principle of a single electrical action generated by metallic contact. This led Volta to invent his electric pile, considered as the first wet cell battery. Toward the middle of the XIX century, the disciples of the physiologist Galvani were able to demonstrate the existence of animal electricity through experiments exploring the so-called current of injury. On the path of Volta's approach, many characteristics of electricity were detailed, which ultimately led to their usage in the industrial field. The route followed by Galvani-Nobili-Matteucci led to the successes of Waller, Einthoven, etcetera, enabling the modern conquests of electro-vectorcardiography.",,Alfredo de Micheli-Serra;Pedro Iturralde-Torres;Raúl Izaguirre-Ávila

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10721449/,[The best of pediatric cardiology in 1999],"Paediatric cardiology is a dynamic field of progress for results. Those which have marked the year 1999 include the introduction of new techniques of cardiovascular imaging and interventional cardiology, and the new consequences of collaboration with workers in foetal cardiology and medical and molecular genetics. The advances in imaging are the result of those of microprocessors which enable three-dimensional reconstruction of ultrasonic, radiological or magnetic resonance images. This provides intracardiac or intravascular views which are very similar to those seen by the surgeon. This is a major tool for improving the diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart disease. Similarly, the introduction of programmes of tissue recognition enables fine ultrasonic analysis of the vascular wall and of endothelial function leading to the opening of a new chapter of preventive vascular medicine from the earliest age. Paediatric interventional cardiology has also progressed rapidly and the past year has been that of a consensus on the closure of a great number of atrial septal defects by new prostheses implanted and anchored in a simpler and safer manner. Prenatal diagnosis has become a crucial factor in the treatment and prognosis of congenital heart disease which is life-threatening in the first hours of life, explaining the benefit when this is applied to transposition of the great vessels or to coarctation of the aorta. Finally, advances in genetics have led to the identification of several genes of heart malformations and the correlations between interstitial microdeletions and syndromes often associated with heart disease: chromosome 22q11 and the Di George syndrome, chromosome 7q and the Williams syndrome. They have even allowed linking of myocardial and cerebellar abnormalities of a degenerative neuropathy (Friedreich's disease) to an abnormality of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, thus giving the opportunity of a real treatment.",,J Kachaner

Recommendations for the assessment and maintenance of proficiency in interventional cardiology. A statement for physicians and advanced training units from the Section of Hemodynamics and Interventional Cardiology of the Spanish Society of Cardiology],"This report reflects the interest of the Section of Hemodynamics and Interventional Cardiology of the Spanish Society of Cardiology in increasing quality, safety and applicability of percutaneous procedures, by giving scientific keys aimed at improving related functions of teaching or planning in this field and enhancing competence and prestige of Spanish interventional cardiologists. The purpose of the document is to describe the importance of current interventional cardiology, to identify quality references and to establish minimum acceptable requirements for assessing and maintaining the competence of practicing or providing advanced training in this discipline. To achieve this goal, a search for a gold standard of the different techniques of general interventional practice was carried out, and predictors of postprocedural outcome were analyzed, as well as their relation with different kinds of circumstances. This analysis identified coronary angioplasty as the standard on which recommendations regarding competence in overall interventional cardiology standards of quality and assessment and maintenance of proficiency must be based. On the other hand, the strong influence of experience and knowledge of results has been documented, especially in high-risk or high-complexity settings. On this basis, the report establishes specific recommendations about proficiency for practice and advanced training. It also suggests that interventional cardiology should be considered as a subspecialty, of cardiology requiring specific credentials.",,F Fernández-Avilés;J Alonso Martín;J María Augé Sanpera;E García Fernández;C Macaya de Miguel;R Melgares Moreno;M Valdés Chavarri

To offer a satisfactory alternative to face-to-face examination, the long-distance system must meet the subspecialty's minimum criteria. For pediatric cardiology in particular, the system has to permit satisfactory cardiac auscultation. A preliminary test of remote auscultation that uses an electronic stethoscope involved two pediatric cardiologists, one listening hands-on with an acoustic stethoscope, the other listening independently at long distance with the electronic instrument. Taking the acoustic findings as the reference standard, the electronic stethoscope did not miss the one case of heart disease, correctly recommended echocardiogram follow-up in the two cases requiring it, and agreed on 80% of the murmurs' qualitative specifics. The patients' parents also indicated that the system was highly acceptable.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30078695/,The Next Generation of Physician-Scientists: Adapting to Academic Cardiology in the 21 st Century,"More than 3 decades ago, Wyngaarden and Gill first warned of the challenges facing physician-scientists in their seminal papers ""The Clinical Investigator as an Endangered Species"" and ""The End of the Physician-Scientist."" In the years since these papers were published, there has been expansion of stage I-II preclinical research focusing on discovery and exploratory studies. Expansion has often come at the expense of physician-scientists whose traditional role has been to bridge the gap between early preclinical research (stage I-II) and clinical trials (stage IV). Consequently, a paradigm shift has occurred, and increasing pressure has been placed on physician-scientists to choose between clinical practice and fundamental research. This shift is particularly concerning in the field of cardiovascular medicine, where the ubiquitous nature and clinical significance of cardiovascular disease make the role of the translational scientist essential. The challenges facing academic cardiologists have then further been amplified by the necessity not only to maintain clinical competence but also to maintain competence in highly technical fields with rapidly advancing technology. Potential solutions to these problems include increasing support from postgraduate training programs, increased participation of trainees in physician-scientist development programs, and recognition of the pivotal role physician-scientists play in translational research by funding agencies. Although the physician-scientist remains an endangered species, multifaceted solutions with a focus on collaboration among institutions, training programs, and funding agencies have the potential to maximize efficiency in biomedical research and successfully translate scientific discoveries from bench to bedside.",,Jeffrey A Marbach;Aws Almufleh;Michael Froeschl;Benjamin Hibbert

Our aim was to investigate the characteristics of organizations and individuals that are more inclined to adopt and utilize cardiovascular devices based on a comprehensive analysis of environmental, organizational, individual, and technological factors and to identify corresponding implications for HTA. Seven random intercept hurdle models were estimated using the data obtained from 1249 surveys completed by members of the European Society of Cardiology. The major findings were that better manufacturer support increased the adoption probability of 'new' devices (i.e. in terms of CE mark approval dates), and that budget pressure increased the adoption probability of 'old' devices. Based on our findings, we suggest investigating the role of manufacturer support in more detail to identify diffusion patterns relevant to HTA on system level, to verify whether it functions as a substitute for medical evidence of new devices, and to receive new insights about its relationship with clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. © 2017 The Authors.

However, abnormalities of intracardial blood flow, notably shunts and regurgitations, could only be diagnosed indirectly from their effects on cardiac cavities. A new step forward was the advent of pulsed and continuous doppler ultrasound, since from that moment it has been possible to demonstrate abnormal blood flows, to measure their velocity and to determine, albeit with some reservation, such crucial values as pressure gradients. Yet even when these two techniques were combined in the doppler-echotomography systems blind areas persisted, and a blood flow of strongly abnormal direction could in fact escape doppler velocimetry. This is where another development came to the rescue, for it enabled both normal and abnormal flows to be visualized in colours. Owing to this visualization, and provided all possible projections are used, it has become exceptional to ""miss"" an abnormal blood flow. The diagnosis is now easier and more accurate, and in a second stage the flow can be quantified by pulsed or continuous doppler ultrasound. The colour-coded doppler technique therefore has not superseded the previous one: one may say that it has merely increased diagnostic reliability, but is this not a decisive improvement?",,Y Houdas;G Deklunder;M C Consigny;L Goullard

The most current diagnostic methods were relatively scarce at the time-ECG, chest X ray, phonocardiography, pulse wave tracings, coupled with vectorcardiography and ballistocardiography, but in the well equipped hospitals right ventricular catheterization was already performed. The therapeutics of the important morbid situations-like congestive heart failure, arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction and ischemia was disappointing, but closed heart surgery was already taking place. Since then, things had changed suddenly. Over the last 40 years a marked scientific and technology explosion has emerged, that had benefited cardiology science, encompassing several broad areas, namely, patient approaching, pathophysiology understanding, the emergence of new drugs and clinical use, interventional cardiology and remarkable progress in open heart surgery. Imaging techniques development and other technology lead to a simple and accurate cardiac diagnosis. 24 hours ECG and blood pressure recording, and cardiac output measurement, greatly improves our medical knowledge.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2528039/,New interventional technologies in cardiology,"If atherectomy procedures are found to be safe and effective for removal of plaque in human coronary arteries, they can be expected to provide an important alternative to balloon angioplasty for the treatment of many types of coronary lesions. In addition, many patients who are candidates for coronary artery bypass procedures could likely benefit from these less invasive procedures. Although atherectomy has a theoretic potential for reducing the rate of restenosis by removing the plaque rather than pushing it to the side, it is unlikely to eliminate the restenosis problem completely. A more important advantage of atherectomy may be the potential for successful treatment of lesions that are anatomically unsuitable for PTCA. Even though balloon catheter technology has evolved to the point that almost all lesions in the coronary anatomy can be successfully negotiated, approximately half the coronary patients who require invasive therapy in the United States are still undergoing open-heart bypass procedures. Thus, if atherectomy can expand the indications for interventional therapy to the types of lesions that are currently considered unsuitable for PTCA, the large number of patients who are currently unable to benefit from interventional catheterization techniques could be treated. With all the new devices under investigation, carefully controlled prospective randomized trials must be conducted once the developmental phases have been completed.

Until 1939, the greatest contribution to the development of cardiology as an independent clinical specialty was made by Mściwój Semerau‑Siemianowski, professor of the University of Warsaw, who continued these efforts after World War II. In 1950, on his initiative, the Section of Cardiology was created at the Polish Society of Internal Medicine. In 1954, the Section was transformed into the Polish Cardiac Society. Jerzy Jakubowski became its president. At that time, Polish cardiologists had already managed to prepare several independent publishing projects, including 5 volumes of the collective monograph Advances in Cardiology (Postępy Kardiologii). The culmination of these activities was the Polish Heart Journal (Kardiologia Polska), a quarterly issued by the Polish Cardiac Society regularly since 1957.

It is best performed in high-volume centers to optimize resource utilization and outcomes. Regionalization of ECMO might require the implementation of therapy before and during transfer to the high-volume center. The aim of this international survey was to describe the manner in which interhospital ECMO transport care is organized at experienced centers. Fifteen mobile ECMO centers from nine countries participated in this survey. Seven (47%) of them operated under the ""Hub-and-Spoke"" model. Transport team composition varies from three to nine members, with at least one ECMO specialist (i.e., nurse or perfusionist) participating in all centers, although intensivists and surgeons were present in 69% and 50% of the teams, respectively. All centers responded that the final decision to initiate ECMO is multidisciplinary and made bedside at the referring hospital. Most centers (75%) have a quality control system; all teams practice simulation and water drills. Considering the variability in ECMO transport teams among experienced centers, continuous education, training and quality control within each organization itself are necessary to avoid adverse events and maintain a low mortality rate.

In a mere 4 decades of its clinical use, the technology used to image myocardial perfusion has made quantum leaps from planar to single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and now to a more contemporary rapid SPECT, positron emission tomography (PET), and hybrid SPECT-computed tomography (CT) and PET-CT techniques. Meanwhile, radiotracers have flourished from potassium-43 and red blood cell-tagged blood pool imaging to thallium-201 and technetium-99m-labeled SPECT perfusion tracers along with rubidium-82, ammonia N-13, and more recently F-18 fluorine-labeled PET perfusion tracers. Concurrent with this expansion is the introduction of new quantitative methods and software for image processing, evaluation, and data interpretation. Technical advances, particularly in obtaining quantitative data, have led to a better understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying cardiovascular diseases beyond discrete epicardial coronary artery disease to coronary vasomotor function in the early stages of the development of coronary atherosclerosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and dilated nonischemic cardiomyopathy.

The most important apparatus was the kymograph, which, for the first time, made recording and documenting of functional parameters possible. This instrument was also used for the functional evaluation of the isolated perfused frog heart that was developed by Elias Cyon in Ludwig's Leipzig Physiological Institute. In the isolated frog heart, important phenomena were discovered such as the staircase ('Treppe'), the absolute refractory period and the all-or-none law of the heart. The isolated dog heart was used to determine the origin of the first heart sound, which was characterized as a muscle tone. To measure regional blood flow and eventually cardiac output, a flowmeter ('Stromuhr') was designed. Precise measurements of cardiac output became possible only when Adolf Fick had developed his principle, which served as the basis for the modern indicator methods. Cyon and Ludwig also discoverd the depressor nerve, which constitutes the basis of the baroreceptor reflex. Finally, the precise localization of the vasomotor centre in the ventrolateral medulla was achieved in Ludwig's Leipzig Physiological Institute. This was confirmed more than 100 years later with modern neuroanatomical methods making use of retrograde axonal transport. Thus, Ludwig and his scholars made major substantial contributions to cardiovascular knowledge that can be considered to constitute the basis of modern cardiology.",,H G Zimmer

In addition, high-fidelity tonometers have been introduced for very accurate, non-invasive measurement of arterial pulse contour, and there is now a better understanding of arterial hemodynamics, and appreciation of disease and aging effects in humans. It is now possible to record the pulse wave accurately in the radial or carotid artery, to synthesize the ascending aortic pulse waveform, to identify systolic and diastolic periods and to generate indices of ventricular-vascular interaction previously only possible with invasive arterial catheterization.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17405554/,[Proteomics in cardiology],"Cardiovascular diseases are among the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. The molecular mechanisms responsible for dysfunction of the heart in most cardiac pathologies are still largely unknown, except that the expression of certain genes/proteins is altered. Proteomic analysis is a technology which can provide an overall understanding of changes in the level of protein expression. Especially with differential analysis, it now represents a powerful tool for interpreting all biochemical responses and their regulation. The principal technique employed is two dimensional electrophoresis (2-D gel) to separate the proteins followed by mass spectometry in order to identify them. Recently SELDI-TOF analysis, which is a complementary 2-D electrophoresis technique based on the combination of two principles, chromatography by retention on protein chips and mass spectometry, has allowed the comparison of protein profiles obtained from diverse biological samples. The publication of genome sequences for humans as well as for other species has provided evidence for the biochemical complexity, and in particular the fact that a gene does not just code for a single protein but for several, due to various alternative splicing processes, post-translational modifications etc... The combination of these various approaches has proved to be particularly interesting in the study of cardiovascular diseases with the aim of understanding the molecular mechanisms involved, providing evidence for protein interactions and identifying new biochemical factors / markers involved in the different cardiovascular pathologies.",,F Pinet

In recent years, clinical scientific studies have evidenced the relevant connections between cardiac alternans and the risk of heart arrhythmias. Pulsus alternans was described in detail for the first time in its meaning as clinical sign of cardiac disease by Ludwig Traube in 1872. Traube had great competence in physical semeiotics and, besides being considered one of the founders of experimental pathology, this German internist accurately presented a situation characterised by a succession of higher and lower pulses. It is not by chance that one of the current synonyms of pulsus alternans is precisely Traube's pulse. The present clinical-historical approach has been selected not only for diachronic purposes, but also to illustrate, on epistemological grounds, the notable articulation and considerable complexity of an only apparently straightforward concept such as that of pulsus alternans. Its comprehension has undergone progress and its definition evolution, and the expression has included through time different physiologic, pathophysiologic and pathologic phenomena.

Up to 15% of ambulatory patients with HF are affected and present with a loss of different tissue types including muscle mass. Whilst cardiac cachexia has long been a neglected clinical entity, current HF guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) include a section on weight management in patients with HF at risk of cardiac cachexia. This article highlights some recent studies of metabolic and functional alterations of the muscle in HF that were presented at the annual meeting of the ESC in August 2012 in Munich, Germany. The studies presented were focused on dysfunction of respiratory and limb skeletal musculature as well as metabolic features of myocardium in HF. Strategies improving muscle function and peak oxygen consumption in HF such as (inspiratory) muscle training and treatment of central sleep apnea by adaptive servoventilation are described. The latter shows promising results regarding HF symptoms and exercise capacity but still has to prove survival benefits in larger trials. A rat model highlights the value of microRNAs to regulate exercise-induced skeletal muscle angiogenesis. Another study provides evidence for changes in substrate utilisation depending on the functional status of mitochondria in the failing heart and points to mitochondrial dysfunction as a potential mediator of metabolic remodelling.

His research has been characterized by challenging the generalizations of accepted ""wisdom"" which did not offer satisfactory explanations for the observations he made in his clinical practice. The results of his clinical investigations have contributed greatly to the opening of new avenues of research and patient management in the field of ischemic heart disease. His clinical and research experiences are catalogued in 740 pages of his single-authored textbook Ischemic Heart Disease. A Rational Basis for Clinical Practice and Clinical Research. This book chronicles Maseri's novel unifying vision of ischemic heart disease. In 2001, Professor Maseri left Catholic University in Rome to take on bigger challenges in Milan where he is now functioning as Professor of Cardiology at the University Vita-Salute San Raffaele and Director of the Cardio-Thoracic and Vascular Department of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute. His research interests include application of molecular biology, differential gene expression profiling, and clinical cardiovascular research such as molecular mechanisms of coronary instability and molecular mechanisms of negative and positive ventricular remodeling. Professor Attilio Maseri will be remembered as a thoughtful clinician, a mentor for many whose academic careers have blossomed, and a careful clinical investigator whose innovative research in ischemic heart disease will set the highest standards for those who follow in his giant footsteps. On a personal note, I first met Attilio Maseri, his wife Francesca, and their son Filippo at the 1976 Pisa conference. What transpired at that conference influenced my own career and stimulated my continued interest in ischemic heart disease as well as my enthusiasm for the international aspects of cardiovascular medicine. I consider myself fortunate to be a friend of Attilio Maseri and to have benefited from my associations with him, both professionally and personally.",,C Richard Conti

Initiating an arrhythmia unit involves proper selection of personnel, as well as technical, structural, and organizational requirements. Proper selection of personnel includes specialized and well-trained physicians, nurses, and medical technicians in the electrophysiology laboratories and on the hospital wards. Standard electrophysiology laboratories must support the full spectrum of catheter-based diagnosis and therapies of cardiac arrhythmias. This includes state-of-the-art fluoroscopy and 3-dimensional mapping systems used during complex procedures such as catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Furthermore, technical requirements need to support pacemaker and defibrillator implantation as one of the core tasks of a specialized arrhythmia unit. Outpatient clinics should fulfill technical capabilities to perform a diverse spectrum of pre-and postinterventional diagnostics, guaranteeing proper patient follow-up. Structural requirements should focus on close physical integration of individual functional units allowing for an effective and safe workflow. Finally, organizational requirements such as networking between arrhythmia specialists and referring physicians and hospitals are essential for patient recruitment and high-quality postdischarge patient care.

The nuclear cardiology guidelines of the Japanese Circulation Society, revised in 2010, recommended cardiac (123)I-MIBG imaging for the management of heart failure (HF) patients, particularly for the assessment of HF severity and prognosis of HF patients. Consensus in North American and European countries regarding incorporation into clinical practice, however, has not been established yet. This article summarizes 22 y of clinical applications in Japan of (123)I-MIBG imaging in the field of cardiology; these applications are reflected in cardiology guidelines, including recent methodologic advances. A standardized cardiac (123)I-MIBG parameter, the heart-to-mediastinum ratio (HMR), is the basis for clinical decision making and enables common use of parameters beyond differences in institutions and studies. Several clinical studies unanimously demonstrated its potent independent roles in prognosis evaluation and risk stratification irrespective of HF etiologies. An HMR of less than 1.6-1.8 and an accelerated washout rate are recognized as high-risk indicators of pump failure death, sudden cardiac death, and fatal arrhythmias and have independent and incremental prognostic values together with known clinical variables, such as left ventricular ejection fraction and brain natriuretic peptide. Another possible use of this imaging technique is the selection of therapeutic strategy, such as pharmacologic treatment and nonpharmacologic treatment with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization device; however, this possibility remains to be investigated. Recent multiple-cohort database analyses definitively demonstrated that patients who were at low risk for lethal events and who were defined by an HMR of greater than 2.0 on (123)I-MIBG studies had a good long-term prognosis. Future investigations of cardiac (123)I-MIBG imaging will contribute to better risk stratification of low-risk and high-risk populations, to the establishment of cost-effective use of this imaging technique for the management of HF patients, and to worldwide acceptance of this imaging technique in clinical cardiology practice.",123I-MIBG; heart failure; prognosis; risk stratification; scintigraphic technique.,Kenichi Nakajima;Tomoaki Nakata
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19883902/,[Transradial approach for interventional cardiology in women],"The treatment of cardiovascular disease has considerably evolved over the past 20 years, resulting in a reduction in cardiovascular mortality among the general population. Such improvement in patient outcome may be partly attributed to interventional cardiology procedures. However, these encouraging results are not uniformly observed in men and women and the rate of cardiovascular mortality in female patients remains unchanged. A number of studies have shown a poorer outcome in women with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Several reasons may explain the difference in post-PCI outcome between men and women. More advanced age and higher percentage of diabetics are documented clinical factors. Other angiographic factors such as vessel size, smaller in the female population, may also account for such a difference. Finally, the occurrence of vascular complications is one of the reasons affecting the outcome of female patients. The radial vascular approach contributes to the reduction in the incidence of complications which may compromise survival. This vascular route may be more complex in the female population because of the size of the radial artery which is smaller than in men. Nevertheless, the transradial approach is very safe and efficient in experienced hands and it is probably one of the techniques which may help close the prognosis gap between men and women undergoing PCI.",,H Benamer;N Salvatella;A Alzayat;H Thomas

It is not certain that triple threat individuals can or do exist today. Instead, we need to be aiming higher, for a ""quintuple threat profession"". Not only do we need expertise in clinical care, teaching, and research, but also we now require business leadership and alignment. No single person can be expert in all five of these areas. In paediatric cardiology we need to invest in the right people. Our new ""quintuple threat profession"" needs to match the expertise and passion of the right people with our current and future needs. Going forward, we should focus on leadership, teams, and alignment.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33314988/,Hybrid Organizations in Health Systems: The Corporatization of Malaysia's National Heart Institute,"Health system reforms across high- and middle-income countries often involve changes to public hospital governance. Corporatization is one such reform, in which public sector hospitals are granted greater functional independence while remaining publicly owned. In theory, this can improve public hospital efficiency, while retaining a public service ethos. However, the extent to which efficiency gains are realized and public purpose is maintained depends on policy choices about governance and payment systems. We present a case study of Malaysia's National Heart Institute (IJN), which was created in 1992 by corporatization of one department in a large public hospital. The aim of the paper is to examine whether IJN has achieved the goals for which it was created, and if so, whether it provides a potential model for further reforms in Malaysia and other similar health systems. Using a combination of document analysis and key informant interviews, we examine key governance, health financing and payment, and equity issues. For governance, we highlight the choice to have IJN owned by and answerable to a Ministry of Finance (MOF) holding company and MOF-appointed board, rather than the Ministry of Health (MOH). On financing and payment, we analyze the implications of IJN's combined role as fee-for-service provider to MOH as well as provider of care to private patients. For equity, we analyze the targeting of IJN care across publicly-referred and private patients. These issues demonstrate unresolved tensions between IJN's objectives and public service goals. As an institutional innovation that has endured for 28 years and grown dramatically in size and revenue, IJN's trajectory offers critical insights on the relevance of the hybrid public-private models for hospitals in Malaysia as well as in other middle-income countries. While IJN appears to have achieved its goal of establishing itself as a commercially viable, publicly owned center of clinical excellence in Malaysia, the value for money and equity of the services it provides to the Ministry of Health remain unclear. IJN is accountable to a small Ministry of Finance holding company, which means that detailed information required to evaluate these critical questions is not published. The case of IJN highlights that corporatization cannot achieve its stated goals of efficiency, innovation, and equity in isolation; rather it must be supported by broader reforms, including of health financing, payment, governance, and transparency, in order to ensure that autonomous hospitals improve quality and provide efficient care in an equitable way.",Corporatization; Malaysia; health system reform; hybrid organizations; public hospitals.,Amrit Virk;Kevin Croke;Mariana Mohd Yusoff;Khairiah Mokhtaruddin;Zalilah Abdullah;Ainul Nadziha Mohd Hanafiah;Emira Soleha Ramli;Nor Filzatun Borhan;Yadira Almodovar Diaz;Yap Wei Aun;Rifat Atun

The Task Force is charged with identifying the clinical topics appropriate for the development of performance measures and with assembling writing committees composed of clinical and methodological experts in collaboration with appropriate subspecialty societies. The Task Force has also created methodology documents that offer guidance in the development of process, outcome, composite, and efficiency measures. Cardiovascular performance measures using existing ACCF/AHA methodology are based on Class I or Class III guidelines recommendations, usually with Level A evidence. These performance measures, based on evidence-based ACCF/AHA guidelines, remain the most rigorous quality measures for both internal quality improvement and public reporting. However, many of the tools for diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease involve advanced technologies, such as cardiac imaging, for which there are often no underlying guideline documents. Because these technologies affect the quality of cardiovascular care and also have the potential to contribute to cardiovascular health expenditures, there is a need for more critical assessment of the use of technology, including the development of quality and performance measures in areas in which guideline recommendations are absent. The evaluation of quality in the use of cardiovascular technologies requires consideration of multiple parameters that differ from other healthcare processes. The present document describes methodology for development of 2 new classes of quality measures in these situations, appropriate use measures and structure/safety measures. Appropriate use measures are based on specific indications, processes, or parameters of care for which high level of evidence data and Class I or Class III guideline recommendations may be lacking but are addressed in ACCF appropriate use criteria documents. Structure/safety measures represent measures developed to address structural aspects of the use of healthcare technology (e.g., laboratory accreditation, personnel training, and credentialing) or quality issues related to patient safety when there are neither guidelines recommendations nor appropriate use criteria. Although the strength of evidence for appropriate use measures and structure/safety measures may not be as strong as that for formal performance measures, they are quality measures that are otherwise rigorously developed, reviewed, tested, and approved in the same manner as ACCF/AHA performance measures. The ultimate goal of the present document is to provide direction in defining and measuring the appropriate use-avoiding not only underuse but also overuse and misuse-and proper application of cardiovascular technology and to describe how such appropriate use measures and structure/safety measures might be developed for the purposes of quality improvement and public reporting. It is anticipated that this effort will help focus the national dialogue on the use of cardiovascular technology and away from the current concerns about volume and cost alone to a more holistic emphasis on value.",,Robert O Bonow;Pamela S Douglas;Alfred E Buxton;David J Cohen;Jeptha P Curtis;Elizabeth Delong;Joseph P Drozda Jr;T Bruce Ferguson Jr;Paul A Heidenreich;Robert C Hendel;Frederick A Masoudi;Eric D Peterson;Allen J Taylor

Roughly half of those affected will die within 5 years, and the annual cost exceeds $30 billion in the US alone. Although medical therapy has made some modest inroads in partially stemming the heart failure tsunami, there remains a significant population for whom medication is unsuccessful or has ceased being effective; such patients can benefit from heart transplantation or mechanical circulatory support. Indeed, in the past quarter century (and as covered in Cardiovascular Pathology over those years), significant improvements in pathologic understanding and in engineering design have materially enhanced the toolkit of options for such refractory patients. Mechanical devices, whether total artificial hearts or ventricular assist devices, have been reengineered to reduce complications and basic wear and tear.

This exchange of information and experience with the transfer of know-how and knowledge has promoted three poles of development: interactive interdepartemental reunions (""telestaff meetings"") for discussion of difficult cases and elaboration of common protocols: multisite continuous medical education and, finally, referral by teleconsultation using medical imaging, in the context of a decisional aid as to the necessity of transfer of a patient to a specialised hospital centre. In the latter context, a close collaboration has been established since 1996 between the regional hospital of Rodez in the Aveyron region and the University Hospital of Toulouse for cases of coronary artery disease and/or valvular heart disease. The coronary angiogrammes are sent by a digitized network at a high speed of 384 Kbits/sec, providing a quality of dynamic imaging which is adequate for validating a therapeutic decision.

Numerical parameters on image quality have also been measured for different X-ray beam qualities using the plastic wall of the ionisation chamber. When moving from 1 to 10 mm of Cu, IAK per frame increased to a factor of 38 for cine and 27 for fluoroscopy. A cine frame requires 60-116 times more IAK than a fluoroscopy frame. As for PMMA, when the backscatter factor is included (simulating real conditions with patients), and when moving from 12 to 28 cm, the increases in ESAK are 16 times for cine and 10 times for fluoroscopy. Because of the differences in X-ray beam quality for cine and fluoroscopy modes, the Cu thicknesses necessary to drive the generator to equivalent kilovolts resulted in the following values (cine and fluoroscopy, respectively): 12 cm of PMMA (1 and 1.5 mm Cu), 20 PMMA (2.5 and 3.5 mm Cu) and 28 cm PMMA (4.5 and 8.5 mm Cu).

A new era for clinical cardiologists],"Recent advances in ultrasound technology have led to the development of fully portable ultrasound machines for point-of-care cardiac examination. Limited comparative studies indicate that these devices are more accurate than physical examination in identifying cardiac abnormalities. Though their diagnostic performance is generally inferior to standard echocardiography, there appears to be good concordance at least for some conditions. However, it must be emphasized that reported results were obtained with cardiologists or sonographers trained and experienced in performing and interpreting echocardiography. The potential role of these devices in cardiac care will depend on their impact on patient management, compatibility with individual practice, their cost, and further technical developments.

Even as the patient population with CVD grows increasingly diverse in terms of race, ethnicity, age, and sex, many cardiologists and other health care providers are unaware of the negative influence of disparate care on CVD outcomes and do not have the tools needed to improve care and outcomes for patients from different demographic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Reviewed published reports assessed the need for redressing CVD disparities and the evidence concerning interventions that can assist cardiology care providers in improving care and outcomes for diverse CVD patient populations. Evidence points to the effectiveness of performance measure-based quality improvement, provider cultural competency training, team-based care, and patient education as strategies to promote the elimination of disparate CVD care and in turn might lead to better outcomes. credo has launched several initiatives built on these evidence-based principles and will be expanding these tools along with research. credo will provide the CVD treatment community with greater awareness of disparities and tools to help close the gap in care and outcomes for all patient subpopulations.",,Clyde W Yancy;Tracy Y Wang;Hector O Ventura;Ileana L Piña;Krishnaswami Vijayaraghavan;Keith C Ferdinand;Laura Lee Hall;credo Advisory Group
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15358011/,Disparities in cardiac care: rising to the challenge of Healthy People 2010,"Eliminating health disparities is one of two overarching goals of Healthy People 2010. Although the causes of health disparities are complex, they appear to be related, in part, to disparities in the quality of medical care. Two recent reviews of peer-reviewed research investigated the evidence on racial/ethnic differences in medical care. An Institute of Medicine summary of the literature concluded that in most studies, racial and ethnic disparities in health care remained even after adjustment for potentially confounding factors. A review focused specifically on cardiac care, conducted jointly by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the American College of Cardiology Foundation, reached a similar conclusion after examining the most rigorous studies investigating racial/ethnic differences in angiography, angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and thrombolytic therapy. For example, African Americans were statistically less likely than whites to undergo CABG surgery in 21 of the 23 most rigorous studies that calculated odds ratios to compare CABG use. Although there is a convincing body of evidence that race continues to matter in the health system, a nationally representative survey of physicians revealed that the majority of physicians do not view a patient's race/ethnicity as a factor in obtaining care, but do believe insurance coverage matters. Increasing physicians' awareness of the evidence for the role that race/ethnicity plays in health care is important because they are in a good position to directly and indirectly affect changes in clinical practice or patient behavior that could reduce disparities in care.",,Marsha Lillie-Blanton;Thomas M Maddox;Osula Rushing;George A Mensah

Fourth report of a Joint Cardiology Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of London and the Royal College of Surgeons of England,"The principal conclusions of the fourth report of the Joint Cardiology Committee are: 1 Cardiovascular disease remains a major cause of death and morbidity in the population and of utilisation of medical services. 2 Reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease is feasible, and better co-ordination is required of strategies most likely to be effective. 3 Pre-hospital care of cardiac emergencies, in particular the provision of facilities for defibrillation, should continue to be developed. 4 There remains a large shortfall in provision of cardiological services with almost one in five district hospitals in England and Wales having no physician with the appropriate training. Few of the larger districts have two cardiologists to meet the recommendation for populations of over 250,000. One hundred and fifty extra consultant posts (in both district and regional centres) together with adequate supporting staff and facilities are urgently needed to provide modest cover for existing requirements. 5 The provision of coronary bypass grafting has expanded since 1985, but few regions have fulfilled the unambitious objectives stated in the Third Joint Cardiology Report. 6 The development of coronary angioplasty has been slow and haphazard. All regional centres should have at least two cardiologists trained in coronary angioplasty and there should be a designated budget. Surgical cover is still required for most procedures and is best provided on site. 7 Advances in the management of arrhythmias, including the use of specialised pacemakers, implantable defibrillators, and percutaneous or surgical ablation of parts of the cardiac conducting system have resulted in great benefit to patients. Planned development of the emerging sub-specialty of arrhythmology is required. 8 Strategies must be developed to limit the increased exposure of cardiologists to ionising radiation which will result from the expansion and increasing complexity of interventional procedures. 9 Supra-regional funding for infant cardiac surgery and transplantation has been successful and should be continued. 10 Despite advances in non-invasive diagnosis of congenital heart disease the amount of cardiac catheterisation of children has risen due to the increase in number of interventional procedures. Vacant consultant posts in paediatric cardiology and the need for an increase in the number of such posts cannot be filled from existing senior registrar posts. All paediatric cardiac units should have a senior registrar and in the meantime it may be necessary to make proleptic appointments to consultant posts with arrangements for the appointees to complete their training. 11 Provision of care for the increasing number of adolescent and adult survivors of complex congenital heart disease is urgently required. The management of these patients is specialised, and the committee recommends that it should ultimately be undertaken by either adult or pediatric cardiologists with appropriate additional training working in supra-regionally funded centers alongside specially trained surgeons. 12 Cardiac rehabilitation should be available to all patients in the United Kingdom. 13 New recommendations for training in cardiology are for a total of at least five years in the specialty after general professional training, plus a year as senior registrar in general medicine. An additional year may be required for those wishing to work in interventional cardiology and adequate provision must be made for those with an academic interest. 14 It is essential that both basic and clinical research is carried out in cardiac centres but these activities are becoming increasingly limited by the lack of properly funded posts in the basic sciences and restriction in the number of honorary posts for clinical research workers. 15 A joint audit committee of the Royal College of Physicians and the British Cardiac Society has been established to coordinate audit in the specialty.

It is no longer satisfactory, therefore, to describe these components in a ‘Valentine’ fashion, as continues to be the case in most textbooks of normal or cardiac anatomy. We then emphasize the importance of the so-called morphological method, which states that structures within the heart should be defined on the basis of their own intrinsic morphology, and not according to other parts, which are themselves variable. We continue by using this concept to show how the appendages serve to distinguish between the atrial chambers, while the apical trabecular components provide the features to distinguish the ventricles. We then return to the cardiac chambers, emphasizing features of surgical significance, in particular the locations of the cardiac conduction tissues.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25500768/,Exercises in anatomy: tetralogy of Fallot,"It is axiomatic that those performing surgery on the congenitally malformed heart require a thorough knowledge of the lesions they will be called upon to correct. The necessary anatomical knowledge is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain at first hand, since relatively few centres now hold archives of specimens obtained in an appropriately legal fashion from the patients unfortunately dying in previous years. One centre with such an archive is Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago, known previously as Chicago Memorial Children's Hospital. The archive was established by Farouk S. Idriss, and was subsequently enhanced and consolidated by his son, Rachid. It is now under the care of Carl L. Backer, the current chief of paediatric cardiothoracic surgery at Lurie Children's. With the support of Carl, the archive has been triaged and catalogued by Diane E. Spicer and Robert H. Anderson. It has now been used to create a series of video presentations, illustrating the salient features of surgical anatomy of selected entities, with the videoclips being edited and prepared for publication by Anne Sarwark. This video contains the fruits of the first of these exercises in anatomy, and is devoted to tetralogy of Fallot.We begin the exercise by making comparisons between the normal heart and the arrangement seen in typical tetralogy. We emphasize the need to recognize the 'building blocks' of the normal outflow tracts, and show how they come apart in tetralogy. We then show the variations to be found in the specific morphology of the borders of the hole between the ventricles, with the crest of the apical ventricular septum being overridden by the orifice of the aortic valve such that the latter structure has a biventricular connection. We emphasize that it is the squeeze between the deviated muscular outlet septum and septoparietal trabeculations that is the essential phenotypic feature of the lesion. We then proceed to demonstrate the further variation to be found in the length of the outlet septum, which in extreme cases can be fibrous and hypoplastic rather than muscular. We also show how the ventriculo-arterial connection can vary from being concordant to becoming double outlet from the right ventricle. We conclude by emphasizing that the anatomy of tetralogy can also be recognized when the subpulmonary outflow tract is atretic rather than stenotic.",Aortic overriding; Education; Eisenmenger defect; Subpulmonary obstruction; Ventricular septal defect.,Robert H Anderson;Anne Sarwark;Diane E Spicer;Carl L Backer

(2) The working party appreciates that the short term problem with appointment of paediatric cardiologists cannot be solved immediately and recommends that appointing authorities should show patience. They should look to the possibility of identifying suitable candidates, at present in training, and making proleptic appointments to allow appropriate training to be completed. (3) There is a need for an increase in the number of paediatric cardiologists to service the specialty during a period when the patient load will increase because of population trends and changes in work patterns (specifically adults with congenital heart disease and prenatal cardiology). The care of adults with congenital heart disease has to be planned, certainly at regional and probably supraregional levels, and the financial and training implication has to be recognised. (4) The working party therefore recommends that there should be one consultant paediatric cardiologist per million of the population to allow for these changes in the service. (5) The working party considers that this report makes a very strong case for an increase in the number of senior registrar and registrar posts in the specialty. The existing number of junior posts will not fill the increase in agreed new posts and those made vacant by retirements between now and the end of the decade. When the additional posts recommended by the working party are taken into account at least three new senior registrar posts are needed.

Cardiac imaging provides a neat framework in which to examine the effect of such changes. Technological advances in echocardiography, nuclear cardiology, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have seen an unprecedented increase in the utilisation of all techniques. The need to deliver appropriate training is recognised and numerous accreditation schemes exist within cardiovascular imaging, with the aim of demonstrating that specified levels of experience and expertise have been attained. However, in the United Kingdom, there has been a change from the traditional experience-based training scheme to a new, competency-based training program, with regular use of workplace-based assessments to prove competence in a specified area or procedure. As this training model is implemented, it will produce a generation of trainees for whom individual accreditation schemes carry less value, given the competency assessment inherently present within their new training system. This article discusses the role of accreditation in the era of competency-based specialist training from a cardiac imaging perspective using the UK experience to highlight the challenges facing trainees and to encourage a debate around how best to ensure cardiac imaging specialists are fully competent at the end of their specific training programs.",,Benoy N Shah;Alistair C Lindsay;Edward D Nicol

Consensus and controversy,"Bleeding complications after coronary intervention are associated with prolonged hospitalization, increased hospital costs, patient dissatisfaction, morbidity, and 1-year mortality. Bleeding avoidance strategies is a term incorporating multiple modalities that aim to reduce bleeding and vascular complications after cardiovascular catheterization. Recent improvements in the rates of bleeding complications after invasive cardiovascular procedures suggest that the clinical community has successfully embraced specific strategies and improved patient care in this area. There remains controversy regarding the efficacy, safety, and/or practicality of 3 key bleeding avoidance strategies for cardiac catheterization and coronary intervention: procedural (radial artery approach, safezone arteriotomy), pharmacological (multiple agents), and technological (vascular closure devices) approaches to improved access. In this paper, we address areas of consensus with respect to selected modalities in order to define the role of each strategy in current practice. Furthermore, we focus on areas of controversy for selected modalities in order to define key areas warranting cautious clinical approaches and the need for future randomized clinical trials in this area.",,Harold L Dauerman;Sunil V Rao;Frederic S Resnic;Robert J Applegate

Twenty cardiology residents were randomized to ST or control before performing real-life cases in the catheterization laboratory. The control group underwent secondary ST and reperformed real-life cases in the catheterization laboratory. Skill metrics were compared between the ST and the control group, and within the control group between before and after ST. In real-life cases, the procedure time was shorter (p = 0.002), the radiation dose lower (p = 0.001), and the global procedure skill score was higher (p = 0.0001) in the ST group as compared with the control (before ST) group. During virtual ST procedural time (p <0.001), fluoroscopic time (p <0.001), training contrast amount (p <0.001), and global training score (p <0.001) significantly decreased. In the control group, all monitoring procedure parameters were significantly improved after ST, as well as, the global procedure flow score (p <0.0001). In conclusion, simulator-based training in coronary angiography improved operator skills compared with traditional in catheterization laboratory mentor-based training.

Currently, no single specialty routinely provides a standardized comprehensive curriculum in venous and lymphatic disease. Method The American Board of Venous & Lymphatic Medicine formed a task force, made up of experts from the specialties of dermatology, family practice, interventional radiology, interventional cardiology, phlebology, vascular medicine, and vascular surgery, to develop a consensus document describing the program requirements for fellowship medical education in venous and lymphatic medicine. Result The Program Requirements for Fellowship Education in Venous and Lymphatic Medicine identify the knowledge and skills that physicians must master through the course of fellowship training in venous and lymphatic medicine. They also specify the requirements for venous and lymphatic training programs. The document is based on the Core Content for Training in Venous and Lymphatic Medicine and follows the ACGME format that all subspecialties in the United States use to specify the requirements for training program accreditation. The American Board of Venous & Lymphatic Medicine Board of Directors approved this document in May 2016.

Guideline report,"Diseases of the heart are the leading cause of death and the major reason for days stayed in the hospital and discharges from the hospital. Nearly 1 million Americans died last year from cardiac disease, and over 60 million suffer from some form of cardiac disease. Conservatively stated, 300,000 cardiac surgeries and 600,000 cardiac catheterizations are performed annually, and the number is rising. Therefore, heart disease is understandably big business for hospitals and physicians. The organization of cardiac delivery systems is changing dramatically, primarily as the result of advancements made in the nonsurgical treatment of cardiac disease. The balance of power is shifting from cardiac surgery to cardiology, resulting in political and economic consequences for hospitals. Cardiac diagnosis is also undergoing a transformation, as less invasive procedures increase in sophistication. As hospitals consider their options in this market and observe physicians, medical groups, and alternative delivery systems providing competing services, the strategic alternatives become confusing and decidedly difficult. This report is written as a guide to assist hospitals in understanding the technological forces underlying the changing market and the effect these changes will have on the ownership, organization, and structure of delivery systems and, most specifically, on the delivery of cardiovascular services. Because of the tremendous interest in invasive cardiology services and the significance of the financial, organizational, and quality commitment involved in the delivery of invasive cardiology services, this guideline report addresses primarily those services. Noninvasive technologies also are addressed because of their importance to a cardiology program, the magnitude of the technological changes taking place, and their potential impact on the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease. The report begins with a discussion of the general planning issues that provide the foundation for the development of an effective cardiology program and details the methodologies and practices necessary to implement the planning process. Included are market assessment and financial planning models, which contain sample reports and provide conceptual and factual starting points for market-specific planning in such areas as demographic and market research, equipment costs, staffing considerations, and pricing alternatives.

Verani, MD, Memorial Lecture: The future of clinical nuclear cardiology","It is a great honor and privilege to present the Third Annual Mario S. Verani, MD, Memorial Lecture. Mario Verani (1943-2001) will be remembered foremost for his major contributions to the field of nuclear cardiology (Figure 1). For instance, he was one of the first investigators to recognize that fixed thallium defects were often not just scar but could be reversed by coronary revascularization. This led to an extensive revision of accepted traditional concepts on the meaning of image patterns. Mario's work on risk stratification by myocardial perfusion and function imaging after acute myocardial infarction was equally pioneering. He also laid out the basic principles for the safe use of adenosine for pharmacologic stress testing. Adenosine is now the preferred procedure all over the world in millions of patients. Dr Verani was a founding member and past president (1996-1997) of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC). The day before he died, he received the ASNC Distinguished Service Award. Personally, I will remember Mario as a very dear friend. We spent many hours together at meetings and gatherings all over the world. I still miss his outgoing personality, his warmth, his humor, and his enthusiasm. Above all, I enjoyed his comfortable friendship. That this friendship extended itself naturally to our wives, Regina and Marjan, made it all the more special. One of the best times we had was during a cardiology meeting in Recife, in the country of his birth, Brazil. I was greatly amused and, at the same time, impressed by the admiration and respect bestowed on him by his fellow Brazilians. One evening, we were going some place in the street on foot. We could not walk down the street without Mario being stopped by one or another Brazilian cardiologist who wanted to speak and consult with him. He was clearly greatly admired and appreciated in his country. I jokingly called him ""King of Recife,"" and the king was holding audience. We arrived rather late where we were going... . I will always cherish the memories of our times together. I am grateful that I could visit Mario at his sickbed on the day before he passed away. He was so fragile and, at the same time, so courageous. I felt sad that there was so much that we could have discussed that we did not.

In response to this, the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology proposed a basic framework of a heart failure curriculum, which became a blueprint for training programs across Europe. The present curriculum for heart failure was well coordinated with the version issued by the German Society for Cardiology in order to achieve good comparability. Training in this Austrian curriculum takes two years, during which the predominant activity focuses on the care of patients with heart failure. The first year includes general (basic) training, while in the second year special modules (advanced chronic and acute heart failure with specific treatment, device treatment, interventional heart failure treatment, outpatient care or rehabilitation, heart failure diagnostics) must be chosen that impart in-depth knowledge, experience and/or skills. Of the five offered modules two must be completed for 6 months each. At least one specialist in internal medicine and cardiology with the additional qualification of heart failure must act as a supervisor at the training center. A certified Heart Failure Unit or a comparable structure should be available at the training center and integrated into the clinical routine of the cardiology department. Applications for recognition of curricular achievements in order to obtain the additional qualification ""heart failure specialist"" shall be evaluated by a dedicated committee of the nucleus of the Heart Failure Working Group of the Austrian Cardiological Society.

During the decade before 1958, cardiology and cardiovascular surgery emerged as specialties. Surgery by closed techniques flourished and open heart surgery began. Since 1958, spectacular progress has occurred. Closed chest massage and defibrillation, electronic monitoring, advances in electrophysiology and a new pharmacology have changed cardiology. The coronary care unit has evolved into a comprehensive coronary care system. Pacemakers, myocardial revascularization and open heart surgery have become commonplace and percutaneous angioplasty an option. As custodians of cardiology's historic advances, the cardiologist and cardiovascular surgeon are cast in a role of decision maker and problem solver. Today's diagnostic and therapeutic cardiology, used appropriately, has great potential for good--used inappropriately, for great harm. The patient has the right to expect the physician to act objectively and appropriately in dealing with problems that may threaten his or her livelihood or life. The physician who does less is an unworthy heir to cardiology's great legacy of 1983.",,S L Weinberg

The novel version contains somewhat modified recommendations on the management of patients with CHF. In particular this relates to the place of various classes of drugs in the treatment of CHF due to systolic left ventricular dysfunction. For the first time recommendations on the treatment of patients with CHF and normal left ventricular ejection fraction are presented in detail. Among statements of the updated guideline the following are considered controversial or deserving special discussion. Perindopril is mentioned among recommended ACE inhibitors despite the fact that it has never been studied in long term trials. Results of SENIORS trial are ignored and nebivolol is not included in the number of beta-blockers with proven efficacy. Despite multiple proofs of beneficial effects of aldosterone receptor blockers on clinical course of CHF wide use of spironolactone and eplerenone is not recommended because of multiple communications about life threatening hyperkalemia.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9821008/,Towards the better treatment of heart failure,"During recent decades, heart failure has become one of, if not the, most important syndrome(s) in the cardiovascular area in terms of prevalence, morbidity, healthcare costs and mortality. Although heart failure treatment has developed rapidly and several novel approaches aimed at preventing or retarding worsening of failure are available in addition to those providing symptomatic relief, many patients are still treated inappropriately. This is particularly true for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, which, despite the fact that only slightly more than 50% of heart failure patients receive this form of therapy, should be given to all patients with the syndrome, irrespective of the severity. Heart failure patients are under the care of different types of doctors, including general practitioners (estimated 80-85%) and internists and geriatricians (10-15%); cardiologists see relatively few patients. Pertinent studies in heart failure have, however, been performed by the latter group and, in general, awareness of the clinical usefulness and prescription of ACE inhibitors is therefore highest amongst these specialists. As the management of heart failure is transmural in nature, proper education of the different echelons is mandatory. Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure are pivotal in this process. However, it is not an easy task to prepare guidelines that are applicable in all circumstances and can be used by any kind of doctor involved in heart failure care. It is even more difficult to ensure the guidelines are implemented and it requires the input of both individual doctors and the national and international medical associations. The European Society of Cardiology is dedicated to this educational process and, through its Educational and Training Programme Committee and relevant Working Groups such as the Working Group on Heart Failure, has already set programmes into motion.",,W J Remme

Regular reviews of the subject can be found in all major journals. Most intensivists surveyed feel that echocardiography is the way of the future. Yet, despite the undisputed advantages of echocardiography, uptake of the technique into the intensive care unit has been slow. Reasons for this are multiple, and include conservatism among senior clinicians and limited availability of equipment. Above all, the lack of a consistent and widely available education program has limited the opportunities for intensive care trainees to learn echocardiography. There is a need for a ""three-tier"" program, where all intensivists learn the basic skills to perform a focused examination on a patient whose condition is unstable, while those with a special interest develop more comprehensive skills or go on to lead a critical care echocardiography program.",,Ian M Seppelt

The results of the 2000 inquiry have been analysed in particular. The number of coronarography centres has increased by 27% in 10 years, growing from 173 in 1991 to stabilise at 220, and the number of centres performing percutaneous coronary angioplasty grew from 128 to 175 (+27%) at the same time. The number of coronarographies increased by 79% (131,636 to 236,111), and angioplasties increased by 197% (30,885 to 91,901). In the year 2000, angiographic procedures represented 39% of coronarographies, against 23% in 1991. Endoprosthesis implantation constitutes the principal revolution of this decade, the number of procedures growing from 393 to 77,388 between 1991 and 2000, some 84.2% of angioplasties, and a total number of endoprostheses of 107,869 (1.39 stents per procedure). The other revascularisation techniques remain anecdotal, representing only 1.9% of procedures. In 2000, at the 135 centres supplying detailed information, direct stenting represented 38.5% of procedures, and the indications for restenosis were 9.9%. The number of interventions performed in the public or private sector is almost identical for each category, only morphological or functional explorations remain the privilege of the public sector in the university setting. The activity of the University Hospitals Centres has noticeably and regularly decreased since 1991, falling from 39.2% to 28.7% of coronarographies and from 41.8% to 31.1% of angioplasties in 2000.",,T Le Tourneau;D Blanchard;J M Lablanche;J P Monassier;M C Morice;A Cribier;P Meier;J Puel

This is the first AUC to address the topic of AS and its treatment options, including surgical aortic valve replacement and transcatheter aortic valve replacement. A number of common patient scenarios experienced in daily practice were developed along with assumptions and definitions for those scenarios, which were all created using guidelines, clinical trial data and expert opinion in the field of AS. The '2014 AHA/ACC guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines' [1] and its 2017 focused update paper [2] were used as the primary guiding references in developing these indications. The Writing Group identified 95 clinical scenarios based on patient symptoms and clinical presentation, and up to 6 potential treatment options for those patients. A separate, independent Rating Panel was asked to score each indication from 1 to 9, with 1-3 categorized as 'Rarely Appropriate', 4-6 as 'May Be Appropriate' and 7-9 as 'Appropriate'. After considering factors such as symptom status, left ventricular function, surgical risk, and the presence of concomitant coronary or other valve disease, the Rating Panel determined that either surgical aortic valve replacement or transcatheter aortic valve replacement is appropriate in most patients with symptomatic AS at intermediate or high surgical risk; however, situations commonly arise in clinical practice in which the indications for surgical aortic valve replacement or transcatheter aortic valve replacement are less clear, including situations in which one form of valve replacement would appear reasonable when the other is less so, as do other circumstances in which neither intervention is the suitable treatment option. The purpose of this AUC is to provide guidance to clinicians in the care of patients with severe AS by identifying the reasonable treatment and intervention options available based on the myriad clinical scenarios with which patients present. This AUC document also serves as an educational and quality improvement tool to identify patterns of care and reduce the number of rarely appropriate interventions in clinical practice.",ACC Appropriate Use Criteria; Balloon aortic valvuloplasty; Severe aortic stenosis; Surgical aortic valve replacement; Transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,Aortic Stenosis Writing Group;Robert O Bonow;Alan S Brown;Linda D Gillam;Samir R Kapadia;Clifford J Kavinsky;Brian R Lindman;Michael J Mack;Vinod H Thourani;Aortic Stenosis Rating Panel;Appropriate Use Criteria Task Force

An example of intervention in the cardiology field and considerations on ""total quality"" in medicine]","The Cardiology Unit of the Este General Hospital began its activity in 1988. We soon identified a mismatch between a good, up-to-date diagnostic instrumentation with growing customers' demand and an inadequate utilization of the instruments. Waiting lists were getting longer, customers were not satisfied, no-shows at the appointments increased and we had a progressive loss in image. We therefore decided to intervene on our processes, starting the project ""TOTAL QUALITY IN CARDIOLOGY"". We focused our attention on two main fields, namely (1) electrocardiography, (2) other diagnostic techniques, separately analyzed because of important differences. Point (1) is basically worked out by paramedical personnel, in high numbers and with stable demand, while point (2) is determinantly linked to medical activity, although with concomitant need for paramedical support. The figures are lower for point (2) but are steadily growing. In the two operating fields we further identified two separate adverse effects: 1). ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATIONS (ECG) ARE TOO TIME CONSUMING, 2) THE NUMBER OF DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES IS TOO LOW FOR THE INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE. We used preliminary analysis with process flow diagrams and our interventional methods were policy deployment and daily routine work. ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATIONS ARE TOO TIME CONSUMING. From cause-effect diagram for cause classification and subsequent Pareto analysis we identified two groups of main causes: 1. the paramedical-patient team is not able to optimise usage of the instrument; in particular, total time for undressing of the patient, lead attachment, dressing of the patient, change in ECG conductivity cream and, if necessary, repetition of ECG for mistakes in procedure is much longer than operative time of the instrument; 2. the necessary copy of the ECG done by the instrument was too time consuming (2') as compared to total procedure time. Implementation plans have been as follows: activity was concentrated in one single room at constant temperature (20 degrees); we augmented the number of dressing rooms and nurses (from 1 to 2 unit); we substituted the ECG conductivity cream with a water-alcoholic solution and the copy with a photocopy.",,F Corbara;G Scattolin;A Gabellini;F Caneve;A Desideri;A Banzato;M Formichi

These criteria are discussed for several noninvasive methods used in cardiovascular clinical pharmacology: electrocardiography, systolic time intervals, blood pressure, and estimates of stroke volume. Several of these methods are highly reliable and sensitive to drug effects. However, they are inherently low in validity because they are based on oversimplified algorithms and yield estimates rather than measurements of function and changes therein.

To begin to address these perceived barriers, the Heart Rhythm Society convened a forum of stakeholders in medical device innovation in conjunction with the 2015 Heart Rhythm Society Annual Scientific Sessions. The forum facilitated open discussion on medical device innovation, including obstacles to physician involvement and possible solutions. This report is based on the themes that emerged. First, physician innovators must take an organized approach to identifying unmet clinical needs and potential solutions. Second, extensive funds, usually secured through solicitation for investment, are often required to achieve meaningful progress, developing an idea into a device. Third, planning for regulatory requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is essential. In addition to these issues, intellectual property and overall trends in health care, including international markets, are critically relevant considerations for the physician innovator. Importantly, there are a number of ways in which professional societies can assist physician innovators to navigate the complex medical device innovation landscape, bring clinically meaningful devices to market more quickly, and ultimately improve patient care. These efforts include facilitating interaction between potential collaborators through scientific meetings and other gatherings; collecting, evaluating, and disseminating state-of-the-art scientific information; and representing the interests of members in interactions with regulators and policymakers.",Innovation; Medical device; Professional societies.,Emily P Zeitler;Sana M Al-Khatib;David Slotwiner;Uday N Kumar;Paul Varosy;David R Van Wagoner;Gregory M Marcus;Fred M Kusumoto;Laura Blum

They are also important from an economic point of view: cardiology is one of the most costly specialties, yet economic considerations mus not prevent the individual patient from receiving the necessary care. This calls for rational use of resources, by means of a thorough evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic tools, as well as rationalization of prescriptions and therapeutic decisions.

Substantial progress has been made in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of pericarditis and epicarditis and in the practically universal recommendation of colchicine for all forms of pericarditis and pericardial effusion, whether acute, chronic or recurrent. This can truly be called progress; however, little has changed since 2004 even in tertiary referral centers or universities with respect to the etiological classification of acute or recurrent forms of pericarditis or pericardial effusion. By classifying pericardial syndromes much too often as idiopathic when a malignant or bacterial cause has been excluded, the underlying cause is often overlooked.

Dexter's laboratory was the first to elucidate the pathophysiologic alterations present in many forms of congenital heart disease, including atrial septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, tetralogy of Fallot, ventricular septal defects, and pulmonic stenosis. Subsequent work in Dexter's laboratory led to the 1st measurements of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and to the precise calculation of stenotic valve areas from hemodynamic parameters measured during cardiac catheterization. During a teaching exercise, Dexter demonstrated that exercise with a cardiac catheter in the heart was safe and produced clinically important data, by having a cardiac catheter inserted in himself. Over the years, many significant pathophysiologic studies that explored pulmonary embolism, valvular heart disease, right and left ventricular function, and pulmonary hypertension were published from Dexter's laboratory. But Lewis Dexter was more than a brilliant researcher ""Lew"" was very close to his fellows and students, whom he considered extensions of his family Dexter was a remarkable teacher, a compassionate physician, and a scrupulously honest investigator.

The enquiry involved two thirds of the cardiology departments of the general hospitals (119/180) and showed that most (66%) were established between 1974 and 1988. Implanted in fairly important cities with catchment areas of 100,000 to 400,000 people, they have an average of 32 beds (range 11 to 100) and 7.25 coronary care beds (range 4 to 19); 347 doctors work full (211) or part time (136) in these departments. These two types of work are allowed in the majority of these units (64/119). Specialist certified cardiologists practice in 62 departments (56%). The usual technical equipment is available in 80% of the units (Doppler echocardiography, exercise stress testing, Holter monitoring, right heart catheterisation). Permanent pacing is performed in 65% of these hospitals, more so in the provinces than in the Paris region. Coronary angiography is only available in 21%, radioisotopic investigations in 15% and coronary angioplasty in 12% of these centres.

To assess more thoroughly the characteristics of Italian clinical cardiological research we examined, over the period 1983-1993, all original articles published by five important international cardiology journals (Circulation, American Heart Journal, American Journal of Cardiology, Journal of the American College of Cardiology and European Heart Journal). During the mentioned period the Italian contribution (743 articles over a total of 16375, mean prevalence of 4.5%) has increased from 3% in 1983-1985 to 5.8% in 1991-1993 (p < 0.0001). Taking into account that research often results from the joint-work of different centers, the 743 articles derived from 1056 contributions from just over 120 centers. Of these contributions 57% were from universities, 23% from hospitals, 19% from research institutes, and 1% from private foundations. The cooperation with foreign countries has steadily increased, particularly with the USA (45%) and with the European nations (42%). Within the first three names, the contribution of female Authors has increased from 7% in 1983-1985 to 16% in 1991-1993 (p = 0.0001).

As to geographic distribution, 57% of the scientific publications comes from the North, 28% from the Centre, and 15% from the South. After adjusting these data for population size, the percentages were respectively 40, 46, and 14%. An index of productivity (the ratio between the number of scientific contributions from universities and research institutes and their funding) was highest in the North.

They with the Romans and later the Byzantines were two global powers in ancient times. Medicine was well organized in the official Sassanid system. Hospitals, medical centers, and universities were developed throughout Persia during their reign. This study brings to light for the first time the era's medical views on the heart and blood, based on extant Sassanid Pahlavi manuscripts and documents. Although these documents are non-medical texts (because Sassanid medical texts were destroyed in attacks on Iran by neighboring powers, such as Alexander the Macedonian and leaders of the Arab Empire throughout history), some novel theories on the history of cardiology can be found among them. Physicians of that time made a preliminary description of pulmonary circulation. They knew about the role of blood circulation in feeding bodily organs. They believed that blood is a factor for spreading infection because of its invisible monsters (divan). Their beliefs can be considered as the first theories on infection due to an external living factor, today known as the microbe.

Synchronized pacing (SyncP) is defined as optical recording guided real-time detection and stimulation of spatiotemporal excitable gaps. In this paper, we investigate the effect of post-shock SyncP strategy on improvement of defibrillation efficacy. After a near-threshold defibrillation shock, when the reference site detected the earliest activation of the reinitiated VF, a 5-mA electric stimulus was delivered from the post-shock pacing electrode to depolarize the excitable gap. This area of wavefront synchronization may lead to a change in the timing of VF propagation, which is important for VF termination. Here, we implemented the concept of post-shock synchronized pacing by a real-time feedback mechanism and demonstrated a successful VF termination by the post-shock SyncP strategy. Further optimization of this technique may prove effective in improving the defibrillation efficacy for low-energy ventricular defibrillation.",,Liang Tang;Gyo-Seung Hwang;Lin Yang;Shien-Fong Lin

The multi-criteria comparison between the wards of different hospitals is not only useful for the patients but also important for the hospitals management to improve their performance and for the medical policy makers to plan strategic decisions. In this paper, it is intended to consider the aspects of efficiency beyond the traditional evaluation of check list. There are some measures which are used in the existing health audit system and several quantified ratios. Among them the most important ones, based on the patient satisfaction and resource efficiency, have been selected using the weights obtained from their paired comparisons. The factors which have been chosen are divided into two subsets: first, input factors consisting of average number of active beds, medical equipment, personnel (such as doctors, nurses and technicians), and technological capabilities, and second, output factors including bed occupancy percentage, average length of stay, total percentage of survival and performance ratio. The input oriented and variable returns to scale model of Data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique is used to evaluate the efficiency of each CCU ward. The model can be used to find out the causes of inefficiency and how to improve the performance. The method has been applied to evaluate and compare 23 CCUs of hospitals in Isfahan. Although the current health audit system, which uses a check list, has reported 21 of them as first class CCU, DEA model reveals that 11 of them are inefficient.

Twelve countries were involved in the study. An investigation was conduced on 25 KAP meters fitted to undercouch X-ray tubes; 13 KAP meters were installed on cardiac units and the remaining 12 on interventional ones. The simplified calibration method has been applied, consisting of KAP estimation by multiplying the air kerma at the centre of the X-ray field by the irradiated area. The obtained values of calibration factors range from 0.4 to 0.9 and from 0.4 to 0.8 for KAP meters installed on cardiac and interventional units, respectively. They account also for table and mattress attenuation. For air kerma assessment, measurements with thermoluminescent dosemeters have been applied and when possible compared against an additional reference dosemeter.

Royal College of Physicians of London and the Royal College of Surgeons of England,"The principal conclusions of the report are as follows. Cardiology continues to change rapidly. In the five years since the issue of the Second Report of the Joint Cardiology Committee in 1980 the specialty has been affected principally by the increase in coronary artery surgery and the increasing importance of non-invasive techniques of diagnosis, particularly echocardiography. The burden of heart disease in Britain shows some decline recently, but this falls short of that which has occurred in other countries. The vital role of the initial assessment of patients to ensure the efficient use of limited resources falls upon physicians and paediatricians in district general hospitals. Each district general hospital should have at least one physician, practising general medicine but having a special expertise and training in cardiology. He should undertake echocardiography, stress testing, ambulatory monitoring, emergency pacing, rehabilitation, and cardiac intensive care, with the necessary facilities and staff. He will also play an important part in the follow up of patients assessed and treated at cardiac centres. Paediatricians should continue to evaluate children with heart disease and their training should include periods at cardiac centres. Cardiac centres currently undertaking invasive investigations and cardiac surgery need to expand to cope with demand. A target figure of 750-1000 coronary artery bypass operations annually is suggested. This implies three or four surgeons and six cardiologists per centre. Other staffing should be based on these figures. Smaller centres are not necessarily non-viable but should be encouraged to expand or merge. Funding should be clarified so that regional contributions to regional services are identified and not lost in district budgets. Expensive capital equipment should be regionally funded whether sited in cardiac centres of district general hospitals. (7) Supraregional centres for the cardiac problems of infants under the age of one year have been identified ans should receive supraregional funding. Their staffing and equipment should be appropriate to the exceptional demands of this work. If such a centre is sited within an existing cardiac centre the staff will be additional to those needed for the adult work. Facilities for older children should continue to be provided, as at present, at all cardiac centres. (8) Cardiac transplantation should be funded supraregionally. (9) The medical audit of cardiac work should be supported by the Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS). (10) Research remains a high priority, and cardiac centres should be provided with the facilities, and staff with the contracts and time, to undertake it. (11) A revision of this report is recommended within five years.",,

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7653607/,Biaxial mechanics of excised canine pulmonary arteries,"A new method has been developed for measuring the stress-strain relationship in excised canine pulmonary arteries. Segments of dog main right pulmonary arteries were isolated by making two transverse cuts at each end of a segment near the bifurcations, yielding short cylinders, which were then cut radially, relieving the residual stress, causing the cylindrical shells to spring open to approximately flat rectangular slabs with dimensions approximately 1.0 x 3.0 x 0.1 cm. The specimens were then tested using a biaxial tensile testing machine. The resulting data show an approximately linear relationship between Kirchhoff stress and Lagrangian strain with very little hysteresis. The following pseudostrain energy function serves as a practical approximation for pulmonary arteries subjected to physiological levels of stress and strain: rho 0W(2) = 1/2(a1E2xx + a2E2yy + 2 a4ExxEyy), where rho 0 is the density of the wall (mass per unit volume), W is the energy per unit mass [superscript ""(2)"" indicates this is a 2-dimensional strain energy function], E is strain, a1, a2, and a4 are material constants with units of stress, and the subscripts x and y refer to the circumferential and axial axes, respectively, of the artery. To assess the physiological level of strain in the main right pulmonary artery, vessels were perfused in situ at physiological pressure (26 cmH2O) with silicone elastomer. The arteries were then excised and marked with small ink spots. Photographs of the spots on four tangent planes of the excised artery indicate a maximum circumferential strain of 21.5% and a maximum axial strain of 36.5% relative to the zero-stress state. These values are within the range of strain used in the biaxial tests. The relationship between Kirchhoff stress and Green's strain is approximately linear within the physiological range. The stress levels required to cause tissue failure are at least 10 times greater than the estimated normal physiological level.",,J C Debes;Y C Fung

For the measurements, the phantom was filled with saline solution of electrical conductivity 0.21 S m-1. A multichannel cardiomagnetometer was employed to record the magnetic fields generated by seven dipolar sources at distances from 25 mm to 145 mm below the surface of the phantom. The inverse problem was solved using an equivalent current dipole in a homogeneous boundary element torso model. The dipole parameters were determined with a non-linear least squares fitting algorithm. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the goodness of fit of the calculated localisations were used in assessing the quality of the results. The dependence between the SNR and the goodness of fit was derived, and the results were found to correspond to the model.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8231972/,A case that biomedicine is unduly negative to radical hypotheses and to theorizing--evidence based on cardiology's reaction to the spasm of resistance vessel concept and on the nature of scientific research,"This communication will attempt to make a case that biomedicine is unduly negative to radical hypotheses and to theorizing. Evidence will be based on a proposed undue negativity by cardiology to a radical hypothesis I first described two and a half decades ago--the spasm of resistance vessel (S-RV) concept of ischemic heart disease (IHD). The theory is regarded as an alternate paradigm and deals with basic pathogenetic mechanisms of IHD, the most significant disorder of Western civilization. The concept, if valid, might help in reducing the impact of this disorder, and I believe that the evidence for the theory and the importance of IHD support a more open minded attitude toward the idea. Cardiology's negativity is attributed to the nature of research; the most important factor is considered to be the Kuhnian negativity of scientific communities to hypotheses which are destructive of conventional wisdom, and a second factor is the special nature of biomedical research. Biomedicine is regarded as special because a low level of specific information about complex biomedical processes has fostered an essentially total study-based approach. Such an approach is assumed to have resulted in biomedicine's use of induction as 'the' method of scientific inquiry, and prompted negativity towards the hypothetico-deductive method used to develop and test the theory. Also, the study-based nature of biomedicine appears to have fostered an intuitive reliance on only newly performed studies to test hypotheses, which led to ignoring evidence for the concept derived from known information about IHD. Biomedicine is also regarded as special because its infrequent use of paradigm-change has resulted in unfamiliarity with this method, and because the practical method of training in biomedical research has worsened the general unfamiliarity of scientists with theoretical aspects of science. Because of these factors, the S-RV concept has not yet been properly evaluated--a quarter of a century after it was first created.",,H R Hellstrom

Furthermore, they have contributed effectively to the broad practice of medicine. However, a strong argument can be made that these contributions, though benefiting many individual patients, do not by themselves completely fulfill our obligations. The concept of Civic Professionalism states that our moral responsibilities as physicians must be expanded beyond our immediate patients. Physicians have the obligation to use their knowledge and influence to promote the common good. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights includes access to health care as a basic tenet. The present health care system of the United States excludes many people.

Study group: ""Nuclear Cardiology"" of the French Society of Cardiology and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Biophysics]","The authors report the results of an enquiry carried out amongst French cardiologists to determine their opinion about radionuclide investigations in cardiological practice. Of the 5,050 cardiologists contacted, 1,431 (28.3%) replied. The cardiologists were attracted by the non-invasive nature (84%) of radionuclide techniques and their complementarity with other methods of investigation (74%) but regretted their cost (55%), their lick of availability in emergencies (35%) and, in general, their difficult of access (30%). Only 38% of the cardiologists who replied used radionuclide investigation on an everyday basis, this being impossible for some because of the distance to the nearest centre with these facilities (on average 32 km but exceeding 50 km in 29% of cases, and the delay before obtaining an appointment (average 13 days) which was often excessive, especially for myocardial scintigraphy (thallium or equivalent). Each cardiologist prescribed an average of 5 myocardial scintigraphies, 3 pulmonary scintigraphies and 2 radioisotopic ventriculography per month. These results seem to be an overestimation; in fact, radionuclide investigations are relatively underemployed, probably more because of the factors cited above than because of lack interest or quality, these latter two points being generally judged positively by the majority of cardiologists. Cardiologists require more from the conclusions of the investigation than a simple description of the images obtained. As with all other investigations that they perform themselves, the interpretation of the results must take the clinical context into consideration and form part of the diagnostic and therapeutic management of the patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,P Pézard;G Karcher

However, academic medical centers struggle with how to effectively set up SL structures that overcome the organizational and cultural challenges associated with simultaneously delivering the highest-value care for the patient and advancing the academic mission. In this article, the authors examine the evolution of UMass Memorial Health Care's heart and vascular service line (HVSL) from 2006 to 2011 and describe the impact on its success of multiple strategic decisions. These include key academic physician leadership recruitments and engagement via a matrixed governance and management model; development of multidisciplinary teams; empowerment of SL leadership through direct accountability and authority over programs and budgets; joint educational and training programs; incentives for academic achievement; and co-localization of faculty, personnel, and facilities. The authors also explore the barriers to success, including the need to overcome historical departmental-based silos, cultural and training differences among disciplines, confusion engendered by a matrixed reporting structure, and faculty's unfamiliarity with the financial and organizational skills required to operate a successful SL. Also described here is the impact that successful implementation of the SL has on creating high-quality services, increased profitability, and contribution to the financial stability and academic achievement of the academic medical center.",,Robert A Phillips;Jay Cyr;John F Keaney Jr;Louis M Messina;Theo E Meyer;Stanley K C Tam;Kathleen Korenda;Melinda Darrigo;Pooja Kumar;Sailu Challapalli

The first meeting of the Society was held in Cologne in 1928, with H. E. Hering as president. From that year on there was an annual meeting of the Society until the last one during WWII in 1941 in Bad Nauheim. After WWII the first meeting of the Society was held again in Bad Nauheim in 1949. The Society met there annually until 1982. From 1983 onwards--the Society now called ""Deutsche Gesellschaft für Herz- und Kreislaufforschung""--the (spring) meeting has taken place in Mannheim. In 1974 an additional annual autumn meeting was established, taking place at alternating locations. The emphasis of these autumn meetings is placed on continuous medical education on a high level, contrary to the spring meetings focussing on the scientific aspects. In 1950 the Society joined the International Society and Federation of Cardiology (ISFC)--now the World Heart Federation (WHF)--in Paris, and in 1952 the European Society of Cardiology (E.S.C.) in London. According to its statutes, in 1994 the Society changed its name to ""Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kardiologie--Herz- und Kreislaufforschung"".

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8034861/,Task Force 4: The relationship between cardiovascular specialists and generalists,"1. An imbalance between generalists and cardiovascular subspecialists exists that will require decades to correct. We question the validity of the 50:50 generalist/specialist ratio in view of current practice patterns for cardiology. 2. There has been a large increase in the number of cardiovascular specialists in the past 30 years that will continue if training programs remain at their current size. 3. Cardiovascular specialists provide a substantial amount of inpatient care, care to older patients and care to those with cardiovascular symptoms, although generalists actually provide the majority of office-based cardiovascular care. 4. A significant portion of cardiovascular specialist care can be classified as comprehensive care to patients with and without cardiovascular disease. 5. Most generalists and cardiovascular specialists do not perceive a need for additional cardiovascular specialists. 6. Many providers perform cardiovascular procedures at levels below the recommended threshold for maintenance of clinical competence. 7. Managed care may result in a reduced demand for cardiovascular specialists. 8. If cardiovascular specialists provide general care, it may not be assumed that previous training prepares them for generalist practice. 9. The appropriate boundaries of cardiovascular care between generalists and cardiovascular specialists are indistinct. They are defined somewhat by the training programs from which the generalists graduate. 10. Many generalists have deficiencies in basic skills in clinical cardiology. 11. Desirable interactions between generalists and cardiovascular specialists involve referral of patients in both directions to the provider who can give care to a given patient, at a given time, with the best outcome and lowest cost.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,S Goldstein;T A Pearson;J M Colwill;D P Faxon;R H Fletcher;D S Moodie

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24336602/,"[Information and Communication Technology in medicine in Italy: problems and perspectives. A document by the ""e-cardio"" area of the Italian Association of Hospital Cardiologists (ANMCO)]","In Italy, health protection is an individual right protected by the article 32 of the Constitution, granted to everyone since 1978 by the foundation of the National Health Service. However, regionalization of the healthcare system has caused noticeable discrepancies among the different areas of the country. The use of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) may be useful to solve them. The purpose of this document is to analyze the implementation of ICT in Italy, on the basis of the suggestions given by the Italian Association of Hospital Cardiologists (ANMCO). In 2010, the Italian government introduced the electronic health record (EHR), which includes a minimum core of essential documents that should be created and updated by general practitioners. The obvious limitations of this methodology become clear in the urgency-emergency clinical setting, where the availability of particular clinical data may influence both patient prognosis and cost reduction. Also the privacy rules, currently very restrictive, cause a drawback in reliability of the data reported in the EHR, thus arising the need for a balance shift from privacy to health rights at the level of both the individual and the community. A minimum core of mandatory clinical data to be included in the EHR should be defined. No formal indications for filling out the medical records are available and most few experiences concern ""bureaucratic documents"" on the diagnostic and therapeutic process. Conversely, we believe that medical records should become a diagnostic and therapeutic tool that makes health rights uniform across the country. Each medical record form should include the following features: a simple interface, a mandatory association of clinical findings and reports, data portability and accessibility, and adherence of the information to a minimal dataset. Additionally, medical records data should merge into a modified EHR available at any time and place through network access points with adequate connection speed. In this respect, inhomogeneous availability of broadband in Italy is at present a major challenging issue. Finally, current training programs in medicine do not allow for widespread application of ICT among young physicians. Some essential topics should be covered by university formative credits. It is crucial to address different needs: the patient needs, making data on ""biological heritage"" always available; the physician needs, providing them with professional tools able to improve their daily quality of work; the managers' and public decision makers' needs, helping to optimize costs of the healthcare system.",,Antonio Mantero;Alfredo Posteraro;Guido Giordano;Gianni Tonti;Francesco Pinciroli;Associazione Nazionale Medici Cardiologi Ospedalieri

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4025183/,The effect of cost containment on the practice of cardiology: predictions,"When health care cost containment is tied to unit pricing, the system may become price-driven rather than care-driven. Although the incentives engendered by unit pricing may not necessarily result in practices detrimental to the young or the patient with relatively pure disease, the potential for adverse effects on the elderly, the poor and the chronically ill is real. Hospitals will soon emphasize quick turnover, efficiency and intensive care. Diagnostic evaluations and chronic disease care will be moved out of hospitals into physician owned-and-operated facilities and out-of-hospital settings, respectively. The health care system will fractionate, and quality control will require restructuring to achieve the present level of quality assurance. Cardiologists, as well as other physicians, will need to alter their teaching style and teaching locations. Better methods for predicting outcomes will need to be developed; we will no longer have the safety net of following a patient closely and altering management plans according to the patient's response.

Some of these developing countries continue to have a high prevalence of rheumatic heart disease, with a large number of new cases with acute rheumatic fever. It appears that the prevalence of congenital heart disease has remained the same in both developing and developed countries, although the actual data are missing. Most of the developing countries have an increasing population due to high birth rate thereby the burden of all types of cardiovascular disease is increasing. Unfortunately, a majority of the patients with cardiovascular disease do not get appropriate and timely care. The health system in most of these countries is very heterogeneous and hospital based, often catering only to the urban population. Although private healthcare is available in some regions, it is unaffordable for the majority. The current situation needs urgent action for control of the impending cardiovascular disease epidemic and for improving the care of the affected population. The first aspect for improvement is generation of relevant data regarding the actual burden, risk factors, morbidity and mortality.

A special process permits the radiological reproduction of postmortal coronary vessels in the same projection as used by clinical cardiologists intravitally. Stereoscopic x-ray pictures are easily produced, even when using an x-ray tube in fixed position. The radiological examination of horizontal heart slices combined with histological giant sections, allows an exact determination of the supplying areas of singular coronary vessels and their branches, as well as providing information about the relationship between coronary arterial and myocardial pathology. The double contrast x-ray method offers the advantage of a faultless reproduction of the coronary ostia and an estimation of the singular vessels, even with multiple overshadowing. In addition conclusions can be drawn from the changes of diameters of the coronary vessels under defined pressure as to the mechanical wall characteristics post-mortem.

Socioeconomic evaluation of clinical cardiology practice],"Health services are systems whose mission is to improve the health status of both individuals and society in general. In recent decades, these systems have faced challenges such as their increasing complexity, limited resources, rapid innovation and diffusion of medical technologies, pressures on demand from society and professionals, and the lack of knowledge of the effects of these factors on costs and society's health. In addition, health care expenditures have grown twice as fast as wealth in industrialized countries during the last 25 years. These problems have prompted cost containment as a key issue in health policy and, at the same time, have promoted the development of socioeconomic evaluation as a scientific activity in the frame of health services research. Socioeconomic evaluation tries to determine if the sacrifice made by society, which devotes part of its limited resources to health care, maximizes the outcomes for population. This article describes basic concepts and methods of economic appraisal in health services which are illustrated with examples of clinical practice in cardiology. Common methods of evaluation are described; the relation between the clinical outcome of a procedure and its associated costs is emphasized in explaining the types of efficiency analysis (cost-efficacy, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, and cost-benefit); and finally a guide for socioeconomic evaluation is provided.",,P Lázaro de Mercado

In the early 1950s, the only heart institute in the world was the one that Ignacio Chavez had founded in Mexico in 1944. Montreal had a medical institute of its own, the Montreal Neurological Institute, which Wilder Penfield had established in 1934. David probably got his inspiration from these two institutions. Two events also coincided somewhat at the time. In 1950, David attended the first meeting of the International Society of Cardiology in Paris where Alfred Blalock presented his experience with his operation for blue babies and Charles Bailey discussed valvular commissurotomy for mitral stenosis. Shortly after he returned from France, David was approached by the Sisters of Charity to lead the cardiology division of a new hospital under construction in Montreal. The young man, barely out of residency, insisted on having a full floor of the hospital to himself with complete administrative independence from the main hospital. He also indicated that he would call the place a Heart Institute, no less. The nuns took him seriously and, after two or three encounters, agreed with his requests, perhaps much to his surprise.

The Society for Cardiovascular Pathology sponsored a special workshop within the frame of the USCAP Annual Meeting, held in Vancouver, March 6-12, 2004, to address the present and future role of cardiovascular pathology in research, clinical care, and education. Clearly, the recruitment and training of young pathologists are crucial to this aim. The forum tried to answer a series of questions. First, is there room for cardiovascular pathologists and clinicopathologic correlations in the era of extraordinary advances of in vivo human body imaging? What is the evolving role of the autopsy? How can the cardiovascular pathologist simultaneously be an autopsy prosector, a surgical pathologist, a molecular pathologist, and an experimental pathologist? Is there a specific domain content for training in cardiovascular pathology and does it meet the constellation of market needs and demands? What are the experiences in Europe, North America and elsewhere? What is the influence of cardiovascular pathology in departments of pathology? Is the subdiscipline still a Cinderella in the anatomic theatre or a Princess with a double helix coat of arms? The Society for Cardiovascular Pathology is strongly committed to optimizing the academic and professional profile of the future generation of cardiovascular pathologists. This article reports the outcome of the forum and directions that may lead to a vibrant future for well-trained cardiovascular pathologists.",,Gaetano Thiene;Anton E Becker;L Maximilian Buja;John T Fallon;Bruce M McManus;Frederick J Schoen;Gayle L Winters

To separate the effect of active relaxation and filling, a method was introduced [E. L. Yellin, M. Hori, C. Yoran, E. H. Sonnenblick, S. Gabbay, R. W. M. Frater, Am. J. Physiol. 250 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 19): H620-H629, 1986] to interrupt mitral inflow and keep LV volume constant throughout diastole. Their preparation requires replacing the mitral valve with an artificial valve using cardiopulmonary bypass, which might cause significant change in cardiac performance or produce detrimental systemic effects. We developed a new volume-clamping method that preserves the native mitral valve and apparatus intact and avoids cardiopulmonary bypass. A modified Bjork-Shiley prosthetic valve (20 mm orifice diam) in a special mounting ring was placed above the native mitral valve through the left atrium and secured from outside the heart. This prosthetic valve was controlled by a cable connected to solenoids outside the dog, triggered by the electrocardiogram or other physiological signal. We compared our method (n = 7) with that of Yellin et al. (n = 2) in nine random source dogs. In our method, no end-diastolic pressure gradient or regurgitant pressure wave was observed, and the prosthetic valve did not disturb movement of the native mitral valve. When the prosthetic valve was forced to a closed position at end systole, LV volume, measured with a conductance catheter, was maintained at or near end-systolic volume throughout diastole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,M Ohtani;S D Nikolic;S A Glantz

Alterations in the valvular assembly, displacement of the papillary muscles or dilatation of the mitral valve annulus can disrupt the normal force balance on the mitral leaflets and result in an abnormal coaptation geometry with incomplete mitral leaflet closure. The force balance imposed on the mitral leaflets is created by the coapting forces generated by the transmitral pressure difference and the tethering forces at the leaflet attachments. A unique force vector cell capable of accurately measuring the three-component force vector applied by the papillary muscle on the left-ventricular wall was designed and manufactured to permit quantification of the alteration in the force balance acting on the mitral leaflets, and to allow for the study of the influence of papillary muscle displacement on mitral regurgitation.",,S R Hashim;A Fontaine;S He;R A Levine;A P Yoganathan

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3706548/,Determination of effects of internal countershock by direct cardiac recordings during normal rhythm,"Recording cardiac electrical activity after a countershock has been limited by amplifier saturation. Modifications to our computer-assisted mapping system allowed us to record electrical activity from 56 epicardial electrodes within 5 ms of the end of a countershock. Modifications included the use of solid-state switches to disconnect the filter section of the amplifiers during the shock and changing the low-frequency response of the amplifiers from 0.1 to 10 Hz to filter out large, low-frequency potentials after the shock. Six-millisecond truncated exponential shocks were delivered between the superior vena cava and right ventricular apex through a quadripolar catheter during normal rhythm in seven dogs. As shocks of increasing voltage were delivered during the T-Q interval, progressively more of the epicardium was directly depolarized. A shock of 109 +/- 17 (SD) V directly depolarized the entire epicardium. Shocks of constant voltage were then delivered with increasing prematurity during diastole. As the ventricles became more refractory with increasing shock prematurity, the amount of epicardium depolarized became progressively less. Thus computer-assisted mapping techniques are capable of measuring the area depolarized by a shock during normal rhythm and may be useful during arrhythmias to improve our understanding of defibrillation and cardioversion.",,P G Colavita;P Wolf;W M Smith;F R Bartram;M Hardage;R E Ideker

Bugher Foundation in 1985 entered into a partnership to establish a group of Centers for Molecular Biology in the Cardiovascular System. The goal was to recruit and train young scientists with medical training to apply molecular and cellular biology knowledge and techniques to cardiovascular problems.,,H E Morgan;S R Paul
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/782707/,Analog computer assisted beat-by-beat measurement of stroke volume and related variables in man,"A technique for the beat-by-beat measurement of stroke volume is described. Aortic blood velocity signals are obtained from a catheter-mounted electromagnetic velocity transducer and analysed by a purpose-built analog computer. The stroke volume is computed by integration of each period of systolic forward flow using the velocity signal as its sole input. Automatic compensation of flowmeter drift is incorporated and inappropriate triggering of integration by diastolic artefact is prevented by applying both amplitude and duration criteria for the recognition of systolic forward flow. Early diastolic reverse flow is excluded from integration. The cardiac output, mean aortic flow per beat, and interbeat interval are also computed from the velocity signal. With aortic pressure as an additional input signal the mean arterial pressure per beat and systemic vascular resistance can be computed. The computer outputs are calibrated by a manual method. Preliminary studies comparing values for the cardiac output measured by this system and the direct Fick technique have indicated an excellent correlation between the two methods.",,C Layton;K Johnston;A Selman;A McDonald
