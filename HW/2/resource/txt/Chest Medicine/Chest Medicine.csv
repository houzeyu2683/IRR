https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32166988/,Artificial intelligence and machine learning in respiratory medicine,"Introduction: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in medicine and in particular in respiratory medicine is an increasingly relevant topic.Areas covered: We aimed to identify and describe the studies published on the use of AI and ML in the field of respiratory diseases. The string '(((pulmonary) OR respiratory)) AND ((artificial intelligence) OR machine learning)' was used in PubMed as a search strategy. The majority of studies identified corresponded to the area of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in particular to COPD and chest computed tomography scans, interpretation of pulmonary function tests, exacerbations and treatment. Another field of interest is the application of AI and ML to the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease, and a few other studies were identified on the fields of mechanical ventilation, interpretation of images on chest X-ray and diagnosis of bronchial asthma.Expert opinion: ML may help to make clinical decisions but will not replace the physician completely. Human errors in medicine are associated with large financial losses, and many of them could be prevented with the help of AI and ML. AI is particularly useful in the absence of conclusive evidence of decision-making.",Artificial intelligence; COPD; machine learning; pulmonary fibrosis; respiratory diseases.,Evgeni Mekov;Marc Miravitlles;Rosen Petkov
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32971076/,Change: Leadership Essentials for Chest Medicine Professionals,"Change is a fact of life; the absence of change creates stagnation. This is perhaps especially true in health care, where progress in treating disease depends on innovation and progress. At the same time, change is often uncomfortable. Thus, it is helpful to model the change process to optimize the chances of successfully effecting change. Furthermore, how to lead change is a critical leadership competency. Three models for leading change are reviewed: the first-the eight stages of change-which was not designed for health care; the second called ""switch""; and the third called Amicus, which was uniquely designed for health care. The models share many common features, with the explicit reminder in the third model that physicians should be involved in the change effort early. Although sparse, the evidence does suggest the applicability of these models to health care. Beyond having a roadmap for leading change, it is helpful to assess the worthiness of undertaking a change effort and of predicting the phasic response to change efforts, given that humans are often change-averse. In this regard, both the ""payoff matrix"" and the change curve, derived from the work of Kübler-Ross on grieving, are offered as tools. Finally, physicians' avidity for change is framed by two opposing vectors. On the one hand, physicians share in the general human aversion to change. On the other hand, physicians are data-reverent and also wish to do their best for patients, which encourages their embrace of ever-increasing evidence and change.",change; leadership; models.,James K Stoller
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32956716/,"Leadership Essentials for CHEST Medicine Professionals: Models, Attributes, and Styles","In the context that leadership matters and that leadership competencies differ from those needed to practice medicine or conduct research, developing leadership competencies for physicians is important. Indeed, effective leadership is needed ubiquitously in health care, both at the executive level and at the bedside (eg, leading clinical teams and problem-solving on the ward). Various leadership models have been proposed, most converging on common attributes, like envisioning a new and better future state, inspiring others around this shared vision, empowering others to effect the vision, modeling the expected behaviors, and engaging others by appealing to shared values. Attention to creating an organizational culture that is informed by the seven classic virtues (trust, compassion, courage, justice, wisdom, temperance, and hope) can also unleash discretionary effort in the organization to achieve high performance. Health care-specific leadership competencies include: technical expertise, not only in one's clinical/scientific arena to garner colleagues' respect but also regarding operations; strategic thinking; finance; human resources; and information technology. Also, knowledge of the regulatory and legislative environments of health care is critical, as is being a problem-solver and lifelong learner. Perhaps most important to leadership in health care, as in all sectors, is having emotional intelligence. A spectrum of leadership styles has been described, and effective leaders are facile in deploying each style in a situationally appropriate way. Overall, leadership competencies can be developed, and leadership development programs are signature features of leading health-care organizations.",change; emotional intelligence; leadership.,James K Stoller

The GOLD documents endeavor to incorporate latest evidence and expert consensus and are intended for use as ""strategy documents"" for implementation of effective care for chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) on a global level. The GOLD 2018 report defines COPD as a ""common, preventable and treatable disease that is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation that is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities, usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases,"" with the criteria of ""persistent respiratory symptoms"" being a new and controversial inclusion since 2017. With the availability of newer pharmacotherapy options, treatment recommendations are made on the basis of a review of the latest literature and directed by symptom burden and health care utilization. Apart from the change in definition, a major shift in the recommendations is the exclusion of severity of airflow limitation as one of the major factors in guiding therapy.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32956713/,Emotional Intelligence: Leadership Essentials for Chest Medicine Professionals,"Emotional intelligence (EI) has become widely appreciated as an important leadership attribute, in business, education and, increasingly, in health care. Defined as ""the capacity to understand your own and others' emotions and to motivate and develop yourself and others in service of improved work performance and enhanced organizational effectiveness,"" EI is correlated with a number of success attributes in several sectors; for example, in business, with enhanced business performance and enhanced personal career success, and in health care, with enhanced patient satisfaction, lower burnout, lower litigation risk, and enhanced leadership success. While multiple models of EI have evolved, perhaps the most popular model is framed around four general rubrics with component competencies. The general rubrics are: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. EI can be measured by using available instruments, and it can be learned and taught. Indeed, teaching EI has become increasingly common in health-care organizations in service of improving health care and health-care leadership. Although more research is needed, ample evidence supports the notion that EI is a critical success element for success as a health-care leader, especially because EI competencies differ markedly from the clinical and scientific skills that are core to being a clinician and/or investigator. This review of EI presents evidence in support of the relevance of EI to health care and health-care leadership, discusses how and when EI can be developed among health-care providers, and considers remaining questions.",emotional intelligence; leadership; relationship management; self-awareness; self-management.,James K Stoller

Bronchiectasis represents the final common pathway of a number of infectious, genetic, autoimmune, developmental and allergic disorders and is highly heterogeneous in its aetiology, impact and prognosis. The goals of therapy should be: to improve airway mucus clearance through physiotherapy with or without adjunctive therapies; to suppress, eradicate and prevent airway bacterial colonisation; to reduce airway inflammation; and to improve physical functioning and quality of life. Fortunately, an increasing body of evidence supports interventions in bronchiectasis. The field has benefited greatly from the introduction of evidence-based guidelines in some European countries and randomised controlled trials have now demonstrated the benefit of long-term macrolide therapy, with accumulating evidence for inhaled therapies, physiotherapy and pulmonary rehabilitation.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22743675/,Multi-ethnic reference values for spirometry for the 3-95-yr age range: the global lung function 2012 equations,"The aim of the Task Force was to derive continuous prediction equations and their lower limits of normal for spirometric indices, which are applicable globally. Over 160,000 data points from 72 centres in 33 countries were shared with the European Respiratory Society Global Lung Function Initiative. Eliminating data that could not be used (mostly missing ethnic group, some outliers) left 97,759 records of healthy nonsmokers (55.3% females) aged 2.5-95 yrs. Lung function data were collated and prediction equations derived using the LMS method, which allows simultaneous modelling of the mean (mu), the coefficient of variation (sigma) and skewness (lambda) of a distribution family. After discarding 23,572 records, mostly because they could not be combined with other ethnic or geographic groups, reference equations were derived for healthy individuals aged 3-95 yrs for Caucasians (n=57,395), African-Americans (n=3,545), and North (n=4,992) and South East Asians (n=8,255). Forced expiratory value in 1 s (FEV(1)) and forced vital capacity (FVC) between ethnic groups differed proportionally from that in Caucasians, such that FEV(1)/FVC remained virtually independent of ethnic group. For individuals not represented by these four groups, or of mixed ethnic origins, a composite equation taken as the average of the above equations is provided to facilitate interpretation until a more appropriate solution is developed. Spirometric prediction equations for the 3-95-age range are now available that include appropriate age-dependent lower limits of normal. They can be applied globally to different ethnic groups. Additional data from the Indian subcontinent and Arabic, Polynesian and Latin American countries, as well as Africa will further improve these equations in the future.",,Philip H Quanjer;Sanja Stanojevic;Tim J Cole;Xaver Baur;Graham L Hall;Bruce H Culver;Paul L Enright;John L Hankinson;Mary S M Ip;Jinping Zheng;Janet Stocks;ERS Global Lung Function Initiative

The standard GRADE approach will be used to grade recommendations in all CHEST guidelines, including updates to previously published guidelines.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27706130/,"Evolution of surfactant therapy for respiratory distress syndrome: past, present, and future","Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) due to surfactant deficiency is the most common cause of respiratory failure in preterm infants. Tremendous progress has been made since the original description that surfactant deficiency is the major cause of RDS. Surfactant therapy has been extensively studied in preterm infants and has been shown to significantly decrease air leaks and neonatal and infant mortality. Synthetic and animal-derived surfactants from bovine as well as porcine origin have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials. Animal-derived surfactants generally result in faster weaning of respiratory support, shorter duration of invasive ventilation, and decreased mortality when compared to first- or second-generation of synthetic surfactants, but some of the second-generation synthetic surfactants are at least not inferior to the animal-derived surfactants. Using a higher initial dose of porcine derived surfactant may provide better outcomes when compared with using lower doses of bovine surfactants, likely, due to compositional difference and/or the dose. Third-generation synthetic surfactant containing peptide analogs of surfactant protein B and C are currently being studied. Less invasive intra-tracheal surfactant administration techniques in spontaneously breathing neonate receiving noninvasive ventilator support are also being evaluated. In the present era, prophylactic surfactant is not recommended as it may increase the risk of lung injury or death. In the future, surfactants may be used as vector to deliver steroids, or used in combination with molecules, such as, recombinant Club Cell Protein-10 (rhCC-10) to improve pulmonary outcomes. Also, noninvasive surfactant administration techniques, such as aerosolization or atomization of surfactant may play a greater role in the future.",,Smeeta Sardesai;Manoj Biniwale;Fiona Wertheimer;Arlene Garingo;Rangasamy Ramanathan
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31320455/,ERS statement on tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia in children,"Tracheomalacia and tracheobronchomalacia may be primary abnormalities of the large airways or associated with a wide variety of congenital and acquired conditions. The evidence on diagnosis, classification and management is scant. There is no universally accepted classification of severity. Clinical presentation includes early-onset stridor or fixed wheeze, recurrent infections, brassy cough and even near-death attacks, depending on the site and severity of the lesion. Diagnosis is usually made by flexible bronchoscopy in a free-breathing child but may also be shown by other dynamic imaging techniques such as low-contrast volume bronchography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Lung function testing can provide supportive evidence but is not diagnostic. Management may be medical or surgical, depending on the nature and severity of the lesions, but the evidence base for any therapy is limited. While medical options that include bronchodilators, anti-muscarinic agents, mucolytics and antibiotics (as well as treatment of comorbidities and associated conditions) are used, there is currently little evidence for benefit. Chest physiotherapy is commonly prescribed, but the evidence base is poor. When symptoms are severe, surgical options include aortopexy or posterior tracheopexy, tracheal resection of short affected segments, internal stents and external airway splinting. If respiratory support is needed, continuous positive airway pressure is the most commonly used modality either via a face mask or tracheostomy. Parents of children with tracheobronchomalacia report diagnostic delays and anxieties about how to manage their child's condition, and want more information.

Moreover, nanoparticles can be loaded with DNA and act as vectors for gene therapy in diseases like cystic fibrosis. Even lung diagnostics with computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) profits from new nanoparticle based contrast agents. However, the risks of nanotechnology also have to be taken into consideration as engineered nanomaterials resemble natural fine dusts and fibers, which are known to be harmful for the respiratory system in many cases. Recent studies have shown that nanoparticles in the respiratory tract can influence the immune system, can create oxidative stress and even cause genotoxicity. Another important aspect to assess the safety of nanotechnology based products is the absorption of nanoparticles.

Building on traditional definitions and concepts within medication adherence, the ABC taxonomy considers the temporal sequence of steps a patient must undertake to be defined as ""adherent to treatment"": (A) initiation, (B) implementation, and (C) persistence. We explain the clinical and research relevance of differentiating between these phases, point to differences in its applicability in observational and experimental research, review strengths and limitations of available measures, and highlight recent findings on specific determinants of these behaviors. Finally, we provide recommendations for research and practice with a view to supporting and sign posting opportunities to improve future respiratory medication adherence and associated research.",ABC taxonomy; Asthma; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); Implementation; Initiation; Medication adherence; Persistence.,Bernard Vrijens;Alexandra L Dima;Eric Van Ganse;Job F M van Boven;Michelle N Eakin;Juliet M Foster;Marijn de Bruin;Alison Chisholm;David Price

This has been driven by the development of deep neural networks (DNNs)-complex networks residing in silico but loosely modelled on the human brain-that can process complex input data such as a chest radiograph image and output a classification such as 'normal' or 'abnormal'. DNNs are 'trained' using large banks of images or other input data that have been assigned the correct labels. DNNs have shown the potential to equal or even surpass the accuracy of human experts in pattern recognition tasks such as interpreting medical images or biosignals. Within respiratory medicine, the main applications of AI and machine learning thus far have been the interpretation of thoracic imaging, lung pathology slides and physiological data such as pulmonary function tests.

It can be performed with entry-level equipment and by personnel with minimal training. Its advantages include low cost, lack of radiation and immediate application at the point of care. The main indications for transthoracic US are the qualitative and quantitative assessment of pleural effusions, pleural thickening, diaphragmatic pathology, and chest wall and pleural tumours. US may also be used to visualise pulmonary pathologies that abutt the pleura, including consolidation and the interstitial syndrome. Transthoracic US is at least as sensitive as chest radiographs in the detection of pneumothoraces, and is useful in diagnosing skeletal abnormalities like rib fractures. It is the ideal tool to guide transthoracic procedures, including thoracocentesis and pleural biopsy. Moreover, US-assisted procedures can be performed by a single clinician with no sedation and minimal monitoring. US-assisted fine needle aspiration and/or cutting needle biopsy of extrathoracic lymph nodes, lesions arising from the chest wall, pleura, peripheral lung and mediastinum are safe and have a high yield in the of hands of clinicians. US can potentially also guide aspiration and biopsy of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, consolidations and lung abscesses.

It implies a direct transmission of knowledge, but also entails some drawbacks such as disparity in learning opportunities, subjective evaluation of the trainee and potential risks for patients. There is growing interest in simulation training as a teaching technique, where students practice their skills in a secure environment, then analyse their performance in a debriefing session. It is complementary to other learning methods (abstraction, observation or mentorship) and forms part of an ethical approach: 'never practice on a real patient for the first time'. We have reviewed the literature related to simulation training in pulmonary medicine and in particular for physical examination, technical skills, pathologies, communication with patients and therapeutic education. In most of the studies, simulation training is a way of speeding up students' training - without necessarily yielding better results - and of respecting the procedures.

In the early years there was an intense discussion about whether tuberculosis (TB) is more caused by heredity or by infection. Finally, the arguments of leading TB specialists were accepted that TB is predominantly an infectious disease. In 1939, the year Germany started World War II, TB mortality was at its lowest, with only a few countries having lower rates. TB mortality increased in all areas during the war, both in the civilian population and in the Wehrmacht, as well as in prisoners of war, foreign forced laborers and concentration camps. Incapable TB patients were considered biological and social ""ballast"". They were worthless for the ""national community"" and had to be socially excluded. Thus one could refuse them the ""marriage loan"" introduced in the summer 1933, forbid starting from 1935 also the marriage. From 1938 on, TB-patients with open TB, who showed themselves unreasonable, could be compulsorily isolated as ""asocial"" by public health physicians - mostly pulmonary specialists. There, under prison conditions and with limited food, most patients fell victim to TB in a short time. Especially inhuman was the handling of prisoners in the concentration camps, where the disease was very common. Thousands of people were killed prematurely through deliberate neglect, starvation, abuse for medical experiments, or simply murdered. TB mortality increased by 160 - 240 % compared to pre-war levels. With the support of the victorious Allied powers, the TB control system was restructured and the institutions such as DGP and DZK were re-established. In the following years, the TB situation improved slowly, in the FRG initially slightly faster than in the GDR.",,R Loddenkemper;N Konietzko;V Seehausen
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28839102/,The beginnings of cardiac catheterization and the resulting impact on pulmonary medicine,"The early history of cardiac catheterization has many interesting features. First, although it would be natural to assume that the procedure was initiated by cardiologists, two of the three people who shared the Nobel Prize for the discovery were pulmonologists, while the third was a urologist. The primary objective of the pulmonologists André Cournand and Dickinson Richards was to obtain mixed venous blood from the right heart so that they could use the Fick principle to calculate total pulmonary blood flow. Cournand's initial catheterization studies were prompted by his reading of an account by Werner Forssmann, who catheterized himself 12 years before. His bold experiment was one of the most bizarre in medical history. In the earliest studies that followed, Cournand and colleagues first passed catheters into the right atrium, and then into the right ventricle, and finally, the pulmonary artery. At the time, the investigators did not appreciate the significance of the low vascular pressures, nor that what they had done would revolutionize interventional cardiology. Within a year, William Dock predicted that there would be a very low blood flow at the top of the upright lung, and he proposed that this was the cause of the apical localization of pulmonary tuberculosis. The fact that the pulmonary vascular pressures are very low has many implications in lung disease. Cardiac catheterization changed the face of investigative cardiology, and its instigators were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1956.",pulmonary tuberculosis; pulmonary vascular pressures; self-experimentation; uneven pulmonary blood flow.,John B West

Health-care providers are turning toward value assessments while simultaneously tasked with the mission of offering state of the art technologies and services. Pulmonologists desiring NT are thus faced with increased scrutiny in their evaluation of costs and clinical data to support investments. Consideration of this scrutiny and further evidence to temper the evaluation will improve the likelihood of adoption and patient access to clinically impactful technology. The identification of this evidence may provide a comprehensive view of the clinical and economic benefits of such technologies to both administrators and pulmonary clinicians. It is imperative that all parties involved in the decision process work collaboratively to deploy value added and clinically impactful technologies.

There has been a rapid proliferation of new pulmonary procedural technologies over the last decade. Common diagnostic applications include endobronchial ultrasound, guided bronchoscopy and a number of pleural disease interventions. Endobronchial ultrasound is performed with a specially design flexible bronchoscope and allows safe and accurate sampling of intrathoracic structures through the airway wall under direct visualization. Guided bronchoscopy methods are granting significant improvement in the diagnostic yield of flexible bronchoscopy. Virtual bronchoscopy, radial probe endobronchial ultrasound and electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy are examples of these methods. Interventional pulmonologists can also be trained to perform ultrasound guided thoracentesis, closed-needle pleural biopsy and medical thoracoscopy to help in the diagnosis of different pleural pathologies. Therapeutic applications can be used to efficiently bring symptomatic relief of benign and malignant central airway obstruction by using a myriad of flexible and rigid bronchoscopy techniques. Airway stenting and ablative techniques such as laser, electrocautery, cryosurgery and microdebrider techniques are example of resources that can be used by interventional pulmonologists for therapeutic purposes. A number of effective therapies for the management of malignant pleural disease have been studied in recent years, including chemical pleurodesis and tunnelled pleural catheters, greatly adding to our understanding of which therapy to use in which patient.

Rigid bronchoscopy has a history of over 100 years. The use of rigid bronchoscopy was abandoned upon the introduction of the fiberoptic bronchoscope but has made a reappearance with the development of interventional pulmonology in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The advantages of rigid bronchoscopy include allowing simultaneous procedures, such as ablation, debulking and suctioning, without limiting ventilation but at the moment there are no standard approaches to perform the procedure. Rigid bronchoscopy also plays a vital role in stent placement, repositioning, maintenance and removal. An interventional pulmonology practice should only be developed when there is a locoregional unmet medical need and when a dedicated interventional pulmonology unit can be guaranteed.

Empedocles and Plato postulated that breathing was linked to the passage of air through pores of the skin. This was refuted by Aristotle who believed that the role of breathing was to cool the heart. In Alexandria, breakthroughs were accomplished in the anatomy and physiology of the respiratory system. Later, Galen proposed an accurate description of the respiratory muscles and the mechanics of breathing. However, his heart-lung model was hampered by the traditional view of two non-communicating vascular systems - veins and arteries. After a period of stagnation in the Middle Ages, knowledge progressed with the discovery of pulmonary circulation. The comprehension of the purpose of breathing progressed by steps thanks to Boyle and Mayow among others, and culminated with the contribution of Priestley and the discovery of oxygen by Lavoisier. Only then was breathing recognized as fulfilling the purpose of respiration, or gas exchange. A century later, a controversy emerged concerning the active or passive transfer of oxygen from alveoli to the blood. August and Marie Krogh settled the dispute, showing that passive diffusion was sufficient to meet the oxygen needs.",,Jean-William Fitting

Documentation is key to accurate clinical coding, validating length of stay, resource utilization, physician profiling, case management, severity of illness, risk of mortality, quality management, risk management, clinical outcomes, critical pathways, regulatory compliance, Joint Commission accreditation, managed care, and reimbursement. Good documentation minimizes coding errors, reduces claim denials, and optimizes reimbursement. Implementing quality improvement strategies that make documentation and coding an organizational priority can positively influence operations, services, and revenue. Other external and internal coding audits show that the cause of improper coding is due to lack of proper physician documentation to support reimbursement at the appropriate level.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30394712/,Competence in pleural procedures,"Diseases of the pleura and pleural space are common and present a significant contribution to the workload of respiratory physicians, with most cases resulting from congestive heart failure, pneumonia, and cancer. Although the radiographic and ultrasonographic detection of pleural abnormalities may be obvious, the determination of a specific diagnosis can often represent a challenge. Invasive procedures such as pleural drainage, ultrasound/CT-guided pleural biopsy or medical thoracoscopy can be useful in determining specific diagnosis of pleural diseases. Management of primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax is mandatory in an interventional pulmonology training program, while the medical or surgical treatment of the recurrence is still a matter of discussion. Pleural drainage is a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure used in the treatment of pneumothorax and pleural effusions of different etiologies and even in palliation of symptomatic in malignant pleural effusion. Medical thoracoscopy (MT) is a minimally invasive procedure aimed at inspecting the pleural space. It could be a diagnostic procedure in pleural effusions (suspected malignant pleural effusion, infective pleural disease such as empyema or tuberculosis) or therapeutic procedure (chemical pleurodesis or opening of loculation in empyema). Diagnostic yield is 95% in patients with pleural malignancies and higher in pleural tuberculosis. In parapneumonic complex effusion, MT obviates the need for surgery in most cases. Thoracoscopy training should be considered being as important as bronchoscopy training for interventional pulmonology, although prior acquisition of ultrasonography and chest tube insertion skills is essential.",,Paolo Carlucci;Marco Trigiani;Pier A Mori;Michele Mondoni;Valentina Pinelli;Angelo G Casalini;Emanuele G Conte;Giuseppe Buggio;Liliana Villari;Giampietro Marchetti

We describe the main pathological conditions where an urgent bronchoscopy is crucial because they act through mechanisms such as airway obstructions or alteration of the anatomic integrity of the tracheobronchial tree. We point out the problems resulting from inhalation of foreign bodies, one of the most dramatic respiratory emergencies typical in childhood which needs not only the appropriate endoscopic equipment suitable for the age, but also great experience in the management of the possible related complications. Massive hemoptysis is then discussed in order to help to choose the right endoscope and to clarify the steps requested to face this dramatic event. Lastly, iatrogenic tracheal injuries are described, in spite of their low occurrence. The correct endoscopic assessment of the lesions enables to select the proper multidisciplinary therapeutic approach together with surgeons and anesthetists. Due to their peculiarities, emergencies do not allow classic training so it is difficult to estimate the procedure volume necessary to achieve an adequate endoscopic experience.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25560860/,Breathomics in lung disease,"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are produced by virtually all metabolic processes of the body. As such, they have potential to serve as noninvasive metabolic biomarkers. Since exhaled VOCs are either derived from the respiratory tract itself or have passed the lungs from the circulation, they are candidate biomarkers in the diagnosis and monitoring of pulmonary diseases in particular. Good examples of the possibilities of exhaled volatiles in pulmonary medicine are provided by the potential use of VOCs to discriminate between patients with lung cancer and healthy control subjects and to noninvasively diagnose infectious diseases and the association between VOCs and markers of disease activity that has been established in obstructive lung diseases. Several steps are, however, required prior to implementation of breath-based diagnostics in daily clinical practice. First, VOCs should be studied in the intention-to-diagnose population, because biomarkers are likely to be affected by multiple (comorbid) conditions. Second, breath collection and analysis procedures need to be standardized to allow pooling of data. Finally, apart from probabilistic analysis for diagnostic purposes, detailed examination of the nature of volatile biomarkers not only will improve our understanding of the pathophysiologic origins of these markers and the nature of potential confounders but also can enable the development of sensors that exhibit maximum sensitivity and specificity toward specific applications. By adhering to such an approach, exhaled biomarkers can be validated in the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of patients in pulmonary medicine and contribute to the development of personalized medicine.",,Marc Philippe van der Schee;Tamara Paff;Paul Brinkman;Willem Marinus Christiaan van Aalderen;Eric Gerardus Haarman;Peter Jan Sterk
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30486616/,Competence in bronchoscopic treatments in emphysema,"Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) has been proven to be effective in patients with severe emphysema. These techniques are divided into two groups: non-blocking devices that are independent of collateral ventilation and blocking devices that are dependent on collateral ventilation so the choice of the target lobe with inadequate scissors is crucial for the success of the treatment. Current evidences suggest that not all classes and phenotypes of emphysema will benefit from BLVR, and that each technique appears to provide a greater benefit to specific sub-groups of patients. Careful patient selection is imperative to prevent insertion in patients unlikely to gain clinical benefits as well as wasteful expenditure. The Chartis system represents the gold standard for measuring fissure integrity and is a direct measurement method. Indirect method is instead the TC study which, thanks to the development of software for quantitative analysis, allows us to obtain reliable measurements of regional density of parenchyma, airway thickness and scissor integrity. BLVR is a highly complex procedure: a first-level competence is a pre-requisite for admission to training. The practical training must be based on discussion of clinical cases and the insertion techniques of the different devices on plastic or animal models, or on cadavers.

Ultrasound (US)-assisted procedures can be performed by a single clinician with no sedation and with minimal monitoring, even outside of theatre. The main indications for the use of transthoracic US are: the qualitative and quantitative description of pleural effusions, pleural thickening, diaphragmatic dysfunction and chest-wall and pleural tumours. It may also be used to visualise lung tumours and other parenchymal pulmonary processes provided they abut the pleura. It is at least as sensitive as chest radiographs as far as the detection of a pneumothorax is concerned. It is the ideal tool to assist with thoracocentesis and drainage of effusions. The US-assisted fine-needle aspiration and/or cutting-needle biopsy of extrathoracic lymph nodes, lesions arising from the chest wall, pleura, peripheral lung and mediastinum, are safe and have a high yield in the hands of chest physicians.

In routine clinical practice, the disease is seldom considered in the diagnostic work-up of unclear respiratory symptoms and radiological findings. For amyloidosis to be considered as a differential diagnosis, the clinician must be aware of the broad variety of its clinical manifestations. In cases where amyloidosis is suspected, it is important to obtain an early tissue biopsy. If the diagnosis can be confirmed by Congo red staining, further subtyping of the amyloid protein is necessary in order to identify a treatable cause of the disease. The amyloidoses are classified according to the type of amyloid protein, with clinical subclassifications distinguishing hereditary from acquired forms and localised from generalised manifestations. Apart from causal therapy of the primary disease, the treatment of generalised amyloidosis includes specific systemic therapy.

The use of spirometry for case finding in asymptomatic COPD patients might become an option, once early intervention studies have shown it to be beneficial in these patients. The diagnosis of airway obstruction requires accurate and reproducible spirometric measurements, which should comply with the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines.

We aimed to investigate the use of spirometry across India, the change in its usage over a period of time and to understand the reasons for its under-utilisation. Two nationwide surveys were conducted in the years 2005 and 2013, among four groups of doctors: chest physicians (CPs), general physicians (GenPs), general practitioners (GPs) and paediatricians (Ps). A total of 1,000 physicians from each of the four groups were randomly selected from our database in the years 2005 and 2013. These surveys were conducted in 52 cities and towns across 15 states in India. A questionnaire was administered to the physicians, which captured information about their demographic details, type of practice and use of spirometry. The overall response rates of the physicians in 2005 and 2013 were 42.8% and 54.9%, respectively.

This financial environment can have important effects on faculty expectations, compensation, and the work environment. This article describes the commonly used concepts and models related to financial decision-making in Pulmonology and Critical Care divisions across AMCs in the United States. Faculty clinical productivity is often measured by work relative value units, which are set nationally for a discrete piece of physician work and attempt to equilibrate aspects of care across specialties. The expected clinical productivity and salary for a given faculty member are often determined relative to one or more national benchmarks developed from data submitted by departments and schools across the country. The most commonly used benchmarks include those from the Association of American Medical Colleges and the Medical Group Management Association. Changes to the paradigm of fee for service reimbursement are beginning to change physician compensation and incentive structures. In addition, research and education are key academic missions for faculty. It is important to understand the limitations of extramural research funding and implications for the support of research infrastructure. Measurements of productivity within education have been less codified, but some centers are attempting to create educational relative value units similar to those used in clinical productivity.

A 5-domain 100-point assessment tool was developed inline with British Thoracic Society guidelines and international consensus—the Chest Tube Insertion Competency Test (TUBE-iCOMPT). The instrument was used to assess chest tube insertion in mannequins and live patients. 29 participants (9 novices, 14 intermediate and 6 advanced) were tested by 2 blinded expert examiners on 2 occasions. The tool's validity was examined by demonstrating: (1) stratification of participants according to expected level of expertise (analysis of variance), and (2) test-retest and intertester reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient). The intraclass correlation coefficient of repeated scores for the Seldinger technique and blunt dissection, were 0.92 and 0.91, respectively, for test-retest results, and 0.98 and 0.95, respectively, for intertester results. Clear stratification of scores according to participant experience was seen (p<0.0001). There was no significant difference between scores obtained using mannequins or live patients.

Regarding prehistory: if viscera of this period have not been kept, some bones were. Since Neanderthals, it is then possible to study osteoarticular pathologies (often chronic arthrosis). But no evidence of tuberculosis was found (all thoracic kyphosis are not tuberculosis). Tuberculosis probably appears during the Neolithic age, because of high concentration of population. In ancient times, pneumology was of course not a real medical specialty. However, respiratory illness already constituted a big part of antique medical practice. The purpose of the physician in antiquity was to establish a diagnosis, a prognostic and to propose a treatment. Prognostic revealed to be of great importance in ancient times, since therapeutic efficacy was limited. Contemporary physicians often neglect this part of their practice. In ancient times, physicians also tried to gradually eliminate magic-religious aspects in taking care of the patients. This review will propose a journey from Mesopotamia to ancient Egypt (and its medical papyrus). Very few sources are available concerning medicine in pre-Columbian cultures. However, it is well known that shamans had, besides their religious competences, a great pharmacopoeia. Because of these very few sources, this topic will not be added to this article.

There are several well-validated competency-based assessment tools available to measure training adequacy in many of the most commonly performed procedures in IP. These tools have been shown to improve learning curves and training outcomes. The extent of how widely these tools are being used in clinical and educational spheres, however, remains unclear. Moreover, several commonly performed procedures in IP have no or limited validation tools currently available. Standardized training using simulation has also been shown to lead to positive training outcomes as compared with more traditional training models. However, widespread adoption of simulators has been limited due to the cost and availability.",,Neeraj R Desai;Mihir S Parikh;Hans J Lee

Clinical interpretation of pulmonary function and exercise tests, however, has been complicated more recently by temporal changes in demographic characteristics (higher life expectancy), anthropometric attributes (increased obesity prevalence), and the surge of polypharmacy in a sedentary population with multiple chronic degenerative diseases. In this narrative review, we concisely discuss some key challenges to test interpretation that have been affected by these epidemiologic shifts: (a) the confounding effects of advanced age and severe obesity, (b) the contemporary controversies in the diagnosis of obstruction (including asthma and/or COPD), (c) the importance of considering the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco)/""accessible"" alveolar volume (carbon monoxide transfer coefficient) in association with Dlco to uncover the causes of impaired gas exchange, and (d) the modern role of the pulmonary function laboratory (including cardiopulmonary exercise testing) in the investigation of undetermined dyspnea. Following a Bayesian perspective, we suggest interpretative algorithms that consider the pretest probability of abnormalities as indicated by additional clinical information.

These systems have considerable utility in clinician education, guiding therapies, evaluating new devices and techniques, and in improving our understanding of the cardiorespiratory system. Simulators and models are of 3 types: signs-and-symptoms simulators, anatomic models, and physiologic models. Signs-and-symptoms simulators range from human actors to computer-controlled patient mannequins. Clinical scenarios, from minor abnormalities to catastrophic emergencies, can be simulated. As has been found with aircraft cockpit simulators, improved clinician performance in simulated emergencies should translate into improved performance in real patient-care situations. Anatomic modeling can simulate basic anatomy for training clinicians. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the airways, using real patient data, can help to plan therapy, understand the disease process, and warn of safety issues. Anatomic modeling with radiographs and magnetic resonance images, sometimes created using radiolabeled tracer gases, can create 3-dimensional images of regional lung anatomy and function. Physiologic signals such as carbon dioxide production, oxygen consumption, and washout/washin of various tracer gases can be used to model ventilation-perfusion and ventilation-volume relationships, and those models can improve understanding of disease processes and guide therapies.",,Neil R MacIntyre

These systems, however, have fallen short of meeting the needs of respiratory care departments regarding work load assessment, productivity management, and the level of outcome reporting required to support programs such as patient-driven protocols. The respiratory care management information systems (RCMIS) of today offer many advantages over paper-based systems and hospital-wide computer systems. RCMIS are designed to facilitate functions specific to respiratory care, including assessing work demand, assigning and tracking resources, charting, billing, and reporting results. RCMIS incorporate mobile, point-of-care charting and are highly configurable to meet the specific needs of individual respiratory care departments. Important and substantial benefits can be realized with an RCMIS and mobile, wireless charting devices. The initial and ongoing costs of an RCMIS are justified by increased charge capture and reduced costs, by way of improved productivity and efficiency. It is not unusual to recover the total cost of an RCMIS within the first year of its operation. In addition, such systems can facilitate and monitor patient-care protocols and help to efficiently manage the vast amounts of information encountered during the practitioner's workday. Respiratory care departments that invest in RCMIS have an advantage in the provision of quality care and in reducing expenses. A centralized respiratory therapy department with an RCMIS is the most efficient and cost-effective way to monitor work demand and manage the hospital-wide allocation of respiratory care services.",,Richard M Ford

Database searches identified published articles that were used to summarise the current knowledge on the epidemiology of ECIG use; their ingredients and accompanied health effects; second-hand exposure; use of ECIGs for smoking cessation; behavioural aspects of ECIGs and social impact; in vitro and animal studies; and user perspectives.ECIG aerosol contains potentially toxic chemicals. As compared to conventional cigarettes, these are fewer and generally in lower concentrations. Second-hand exposures to ECIG chemicals may represent a potential risk, especially to vulnerable populations. There is not enough scientific evidence to support ECIGs as an aid to smoking cessation due to a lack of controlled trials, including those that compare ECIGs with licenced stop-smoking treatments. So far, there are conflicting data that use of ECIGs results in a renormalisation of smoking behaviour or for the gateway hypothesis. Experiments in cell cultures and animal studies show that ECIGs can have multiple negative effects. The long-term effects of ECIG use are unknown, and there is therefore no evidence that ECIGs are safer than tobacco in the long term.

Research performed over the past one to two decades has sought to better understand the heterogeneous clinical nature of asthma. Whereas older attempts at phenotyping asthma emphasized the duality of allergic vs. non-allergic asthma, more recent non-biased analyses have attempted to cluster patients by a multitude of possible features, including age of onset, atopy, severity of airways obstruction, and requirement for medication. Examples of these phenotypes include early-onset mild allergic asthma, later-onset asthma associated with obesity, and severe non-atopic asthma with frequent exacerbations. The elucidation of asthma phenotypes has been further refined by including information regarding pathophysiologic mechanisms present in different groups. These groups, called endotypes, include examples such as aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease and allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis. A growing understanding of these mechanistically distinct groups, along with the identification of relevant cellular or molecular biomarkers, is already showing promise as a way of predicting clinical response to various asthma therapies.

In the last decade, several studies focusing on the effects of various telemanagement programs for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been published but with contradictory findings. From the literature, the best telemonitoring outcomes come from programs dedicated to aged and very sick patients, frequent exacerbators with multimorbidity and limited community support; programs using third-generation telemonitoring systems providing constant analytical and decisionmaking support (24 h/day, 7 days/week); countries where strong community links are not available; and zones where telemonitoring and rehabilitation can be delivered directly to the patient's location. In the near future, it is expected that telemedicine will produce changes in work practices, cultural attitudes and organization, which will affect all professional figures involved in the provision of care. The key to optimizing the use of telemonitoring is to correctly identify who the ideal candidates are, at what time they need it, and for how long. The time course of disease progression varies from patient to patient; hence identifying for each patient a 'correct window' for initiating telemonitoring could be the correct solution. In conclusion, as clinicians, we need to identify the specific challenges we face in delivering care, and implement flexible systems that can be customized to individual patients' requirements and adapted to our diverse healthcare contexts.",chronic care; e-health care; telecare; telemonitoring.,Michele Vitacca;Alessandra Montini;Laura Comini

Against this lively ""backdrop"", Edoardo Maragliano played a central role in medicine's ""renaissance"" in Italy. Having graduated in medicine in 1870 at the University of Naples, he worked as an assistant in the University Medical Clinic. After beginning his academic career as professor of pathology at the Faculty of Medicine in Genoa in 1877, he became full professor of internal medicine in 1881. While he studied all fields of internal medicine, his research focused mainly on tuberculosis.His experiments in the medical clinic enabled Maragliano to announce the possibility of immunization against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although criticized for using an inactivated vaccine, Maragliano continued to advocate vaccination with any type of vaccine.In the Senate of the Kingdom of Italy, Maragliano actively debated social, economic and sanitary questions, without neglecting his duties as a physician and professor. As an officer during the First World War, he organized military health services and taught medicine at the Military University of Padua.In 1924, Maragliano created the first Italian specialty school in the study of tuberculosis, which provided physicians with specific training in the diagnosis, therapy and prevention of the disease. His scientific zeal and his vision of modern medicine prompted the introduction of new specializations, such as radiology and, especially, pneumology, which led to the creation of one of Europe's most renowned medical schools.",Edoardo Maragliano; History of tuberculosis; Internal medicine; Public health; Vaccination.,Mariano Martini;Ilaria Barberis;Nicola Luigi Bragazzi;Filippo Paluan
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26335895/,[Further training for medical specialists in respiratory medicine: how can we improve it?],"Young physicians in Germany often criticize the advanced training programme, especially the lack of structure and the insufficient rotations. The Medical Association in each Bundesland/federal state require to include a proposal for advanced training and rotation in a trainer's aplication for an educational license. However, there is no systematic scrutiny of these concepts and therefore the criteria stated outcomes are often only incompletely met. Trainers engage too little in training methods and medical didactics. They rarely evaluate learning outcomes, and structured assessments based on workplace are exceptions. The reasons are deeply rooted in Germany's education system: Resources for specialist training are not provided, and there is no funding for a commitment in continued medical education. In addition, teaching is not assigned a quantifiable value. However, during the last decade awareness has arisen that good training programmes are an important part of quality assurance and the validation of a hospital. Better planning, structuring and evaluation of training programmes is necessary. New learning methods should be incorporated in training programmes. The German Respiratory Society (DGP) wishes to contribute to the improvement of advanced training: for example with ""train the trainer"" seminars for teachers, with a structured educational course programme for the trainees, with assessments such as the HERMES (Harmonized Education in Respiratory Medicine for European Specialists) exam and with support for the accreditation as a Respiratory Training Centre of the ERS (European Respiratory Society) and EBAP (European Board for Accreditation in Pneumology).",,O Karg

He was famous because of the great medical corpus texts preserved in his name. Only recently, our universities have updated the famous Hippocratic Oath to avoid contradictions with our modern ethics. Hippocrate was a great clinician but a poor anatomist. Hippocratical humourism remained accurate until the age of the enlightenment (18th century). Furthermore, it is difficult to distinguish medicine from philosophy in Greek antiquity. So we have to contextualize Greek ancient medicine in this philosophical field. In the 3rd century before Christus (BC), the centre of gravity in medicine shifted to Alexandria. Indeed, a famous academic library was created in 288 BC. At the same time, dissection of human cadavers was authorized until the first century BC. This enabled the evolution of the knowledge in anatomy and physiology. Rome was still polytheistic population until the end of ancient times. Rome integrated Greek gods in his pantheon. Asclepios became Aesculapius. Rome despises physicians in the first ancient age of Rome. The family's father provided medical cares. A lot of Greek physicians settled then in Rome. Again, roman medicine grew in parallel with philosophical trends. These trends were called ""sects"" but in fact, they were rather medical schools.

According to the attending physician, 68% of patients had well-controlled and 10% had uncontrolled asthma. Ninety-four percent of patients were on preventive treatment, with 91% using an inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at an average dose of 705 µg/day budesonide equivalent. Approximately 75% of patients were on an ICS/LABA, with 91% using fixed combinations. Among patients using ICS/formoterol, a maintenance and reliever therapy regime was prescribed in 67%.Conclusions: The quality of asthma management in the Czech Republic is comparable to that of other developed countries and better in some respects (frequent BDT, phenotyping, and use of preventive treatment). Nevertheless, there is unnecessary delay in diagnosis and lack of research on possible environmental causes (workplace, molds). Pharmacotherapy shows good adherence to guidelines. Although 10% of patients show poor control, there is concurrently a trend for overtreatment.",Epidemiological survey; allergologists; allergy; asthma diagnosis; eosinophilia; pulmonologists; medical overuse; phenotyping.,Milan Terl;Petr Pohunek;Matyas Kuhn;Jaromir Bystron

The first is that he laid the foundations of modern pulmonary mechanics in the early 1900s. For example, his seminal paper on pulmonary dynamics, that is, the pressure-flow relationships in the airways, was published in 1915 in one of the top journals in the field. It included extensive measurements of airway dimensions in postmortem human lungs and a sophisticated analysis of the modes of airflow. This was closely followed by a very original analysis of lung statics, which included studies of airway pressures at normal, maximal, and minimal lung volumes in relaxed normal volunteers, and was published in 1916. Remarkably, both papers were essentially ignored at the time. Fortunately, in 1925 he was able to summarize his major findings in a chapter in an important handbook of physiology. However, he tragically died from pulmonary tuberculosis in the following year at the early age of 37. The second reason for his importance in the history of pulmonary mechanics is that inexplicably his very innovative research was essentially ignored for about 30 years. It was not until the 1940s that his work was rediscovered, although not in time to save investigators from duplicating his very original studies. Possible reasons why his work was ignored for so long are discussed. Even today it is not easy to recover some important features of his career, and some aspects of his very original research are still almost unknown.",flow resistance; intrapleural pressure; laminar flow; lung volume; turbulence.,John B West

With the accumulation of clinical practice, it has become clear that pre-existing interstitial pneumonia (IP) could be a risk factor for drug-induced lung injury, which has enhanced awareness regarding the difficulty in treating lung cancer with comorbid IP. Unfortunately, there is only low-grade evidence in the field of lung cancer with comorbid IP, because almost all clinical trials exclude such patients. There have been very few specialized clinical trials for patients with lung cancer and underlying IPs thus far. Therefore, it is necessary to treat such cases empirically or to give up on the treatment itself. Considering these circumstances, establishing how to treat lung cancer with comorbid IP is an urgent issue. This paper is a summary of the official statement reported by the Diffuse Lung Disease/Thoracic Oncology Assembly and the Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS) in 2017, which attempts to approach lung cancer with comorbid IP systematically.",,Takashi Ogura;Nagio Takigawa;Keisuke Tomii;Kazuma Kishi;Yoshikazu Inoue;Eiki Ichihara;Sakae Homma;Kazuhisa Takahashi;Hiroaki Akamatsu;Satoshi Ikeda;Naohiko Inase;Tae Iwasawa;Yuichiro Ohe;Hiromitsu Ohta;Hiroshi Onishi;Isamu Okamoto;Kazumasa Ogawa;Kazuo Kasahara;Hiroki Karata;Takumi Kishimoto;Yuka Kitamura;Akihiko Gemma;Hirotsugu Kenmotsu;Hiroyuki Sakashita;Susumu Sakamoto;Katsutoshi Sekine;Yuichi Takiguchi;Yuji Tada;Shinichi Toyooka;Yuko Nakayama;Yasuhiko Nishioka;Koichi Hagiwara;Masaki Hanibuchi;Junya Fukuoka;Yuji Minegishi;Toyoshi Yanagihara;Nobuyuki Yamamoto;Hiromasa Yamamoto;Mina Gaga;Kwun M Fong;Charles A Powell;Katsuyuki Kiura;DLD/TO Assemblies of JRS

Professional organizations and medical ethicists subsequently called on specialty groups to generate ""top five"" lists of expensive tests or treatments without known benefits. Responding to this call, the American Board of Internal Medicine launched its Choosing Wisely campaign, with the top-five Choosing Wisely lists for pulmonary medicine and critical care released in 2014. In order for the critical care list to have an impact on costs and quality, two things must occur: providers whose practice is discordant with the list must adhere to the list when making decisions, and those decisions must lead to improvements in the quality of care at lower costs. Although the campaign addresses some limitations of past efforts to improve quality and reduce waste, we believe it will do little to change provider behavior. Even if the top-five list for critical care were to change the behavior of providers, its ultimate impact on costs and quality will be lower than anticipated. Here we suggest several strategies for stakeholders to increase the impact of the critical care top-five list, and further discuss that despite limitations of the campaign it is still imperative for advancing best practice in critical care.",efficiency; health policy; health service misuse; implementation; intensive care.,Andrew J Admon;Colin R Cooke

However, there is an increasing number of young female academics - independent of specialty - whose successful medical career is blocked by internal and external reasons. At the 56th DGP congress (German Society for Pneumology) we did a survey on 358 participating chest physicians in order to identify the career promoting and the career restraining reasons and the relevant aspects regarding the specialty choice of pneumology. The survey followed a structured multiple choice questionnaire (multiple mentioning was possible) based on study results of Buddeberg-Fischer et al. The aim of the study was to compare whether male and female on one hand and Consultant/Senior Registrars and Residents on the other hand diverge in their opinion. Signs of a change of generations in pneumology were shown. Residents consider good compatibility with an own family more than Consultant/Senior Registrars. Residents thought of working part-time as being more career promoting, whereas Consultant/Senior Registrars focused more on the personal commitment. Furthermore women seem to experience a double work load in pneumology with their profession and family. Parental leave, children and family were significantly more often an obstacle in their career. On the other hand they find the possibility of part-time-working and a pro-active personality more often career promoting. More presence at the university, flexible working hours and an adjusted mentoring, related to a good compatibility of family and profession seem to be a good strategy to encourage interest of young academics in pneumology.",,Lucia Christians;Regina Prenzel

Tobacco smoking still remains a predominant risk factor for COPD. Thus smoking cessation management should be obligatory in every case. Although spirometry is integral to the diagnosis of COPD, one should also be aware of its limitations. COPD is a chronic disease associated with comorbidities that define its extrapulmonary manifestations. Systemic inflammation provides the biological link, while exacerbations play a prominent role in the current approach to disease evaluation. This paper reviews the latest Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease revision, focusing on the paradigm shift in assessment that would directly influence therapeutic decisions. Also discussed are the newer drugs and combinations of existing inhaler therapies that now present clinicians with more options, as well as bronchoscopic interventions that may perhaps offer a lower-morbidity alternative than surgical lung volume reduction. Finally, this review highlights how integrated care models can bridge the gap between components and complete a comprehensive sphere of COPD care.",,Augustine Tee
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19648521/,Chronic respiratory care for neuromuscular diseases in adults,"Neuromuscular diseases (NMD) may affect respiratory muscles, leading to respiratory failure. Studies show that long-term noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) improves symptoms, gas exchange, quality of life and survival. NIV improved these parameters in muscular dystrophies and also in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis without severe bulbar dysfunction. NIV should be started at the onset of nocturnal hypoventilation. In selected cases, NIV may be simpler, better accepted by patients and cheaper than invasive mechanical ventilation, but it cannot be used as an alternative. Tracheostomy may be preferred by patients unable to protect their airways and wishing to survive as long as possible, or by ventilator-dependent patients. Glossopharyngeal breathing consists of taking air and propelling it into the lungs. Chest percussions and vibrations can help to mobilise airway secretions but they cannot substitute coughing. Manually assisted coughing requires substantial lung inflation through air stacking or deep lung insufflation, followed by an abdominal thrust with open glottis. The combination of mechanical in-exsufflation with an abdominal thrust is a mechanically assisted cough. In conclusion, recent advances in respiratory care of NMD have improved prognosis and many caregivers have changed from a traditional noninterventional to a more aggressive, supportive approach.",,N Ambrosino;N Carpenè;M Gherardi

The need for sufficient amount of material especially in tumour diagnostics in the era of targeted therapy/personalized medicine is increasing. In pneumocytology, the diagnostic yield is greatly improved by endobronchial ultrasound-guided (EBUS) fine-needle aspiration accompanied by rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) provided by a cytopathologist. This process gives the possibility to carefully handle and triage the specimen for diagnostic procedures as well as specific ancillary studies. When carcinoma is suspected, both cytology and biopsy specimens should be obtained whenever possible and reviewed together to achieve the highest specificity and diagnostic concordance. If no histology sample is available, attaining adequate material in the cell block becomes crucial, as it enables to carry out immmunohistochemical methods and molecular genetic testing from cytology material. For optimal acquisition, processing and testing of limited specimens in pneumocytology, as well as in pulmonary histopathology, the key issue is to establish and operate a multidisciplinary team including a cytopathologist/surgical pathologist, radiologist and pulmonologist.",BAL; EBUS; bronchoscopy; cytodiagnostics; pulmonary cytology; tumors of the lung.,Linda Čapková;Petra Galgonkvá

The efficacy of treatment for advanced lung cancer remains limited; many cooperative study groups for lung cancer have been established in Japan since 1990s, and they have completed several landmark investigator-initiated clinical trials. This review highlights eight active Japanese cooperative study groups for lung cancer and summarizes their achievements made through clinical trials. In addition to their benefits, the existence of multiple study groups for a single disease such as lung cancer presents several challenges including the provision of infrastructure to ensure the scientific integrity of trial results, the unnecessary duplication of effort and the wasting of limited resources, and the accrual and completion of large-scale phase III trials in the shortest possible time. Collaboration among Japanese cooperative groups has recently increased in order to overcome these challenges.

This article reviews underlying mechanisms and therapeutic consequences. A complex interaction exists between COPD, co-morbidities, physical inactivity and systemic inflammation. The components of the postulated chronic inflammatory systemic syndrome need to be identified in more detail; physical inactivity seems to be the least common denominator. The patient's adaptive and innate immune systems play a role for the pathogenesis of infections. When interpreting positive bacterial cultures, it is important to differentiate between colonisation and infection. The impact of viral infections in COPD exacerbation needs further clarification, including the task to distinguish acute infection from viral persistence. Community acquired pneumonias pose a special risk for patients with COPD. Clinical scores and procalcitonin serum concentrations can support decisions on whether or not to start antibiotic treatment. Antibiotics probably do not need to be taken for longer than 5 days, since their efficacy does not increase after longer treatment, while adverse events rise in frequency.

Alternatives to hospitalisation are crucial in the cost minimisation of COPD care. However, besides efficiency, there are clinical reasons for promoting alternatives to conventional hospital admission. Hospital stay itself conveys a risk to patients. The discharge process is a key element in the healthcare continuum. Hospital at home is a safe alternative to hospital admission, but it is not the only means of supporting discharge. Some home care schedules, mainly supported by nurses, have been proven to be good alternatives. Home care is also useful in the prevention of hospital admission. Integrated care is a comprehensive response to the needs of severely affected COPD patients achieved through models of shared care utilising all relevant health providers and promoting self-management. The framework for integrated care is the so-called chronic care model, centred on the promotion of self-management, the holistic appraisal of the patient, the most appropriate design of healthcare delivery responding effectively to the needs of the patient and a good system of shared and accessible information.",,J Escarrabill

An international group of clinicians, radiologists and pathologists evaluated patients with previously identified idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) to determine unique features of cigarette smoking. Phase 1 (derivation group) identified smoking-related features in patients with a history of smoking (n=41). Phase 2 (validation group) determined if these features correctly predicted the smoking status of IIP patients (n=100) to participants blinded to smoking history. Finally, the investigators sought to determine if a new smoking-related interstitial lung disease phenotype could be defined. Phase 1 suggested that preserved forced vital capacity with disproportionately reduced diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, and various radiographic and histopathological findings were smoking-related features.

RC can reclaim leadership status by concentrating on effective teaching and the judicious (rather than lavish) deployment of educational technologies. Teleconferencing has been important in RC education, but its role is waning as Internet-based teaching becomes the dominant technology. RC instructors should avoid the media-comparison research pitfall. Research indicates that students who learn at a distance do not learn better or worse than students in traditional classrooms, although student attrition is a serious problem in Internet-based courses. Online courses are time consuming to develop and deploy, effectively serve limited numbers of students per course, and are not suitable for some topics and learners. RC is probably not a good match for courses and programs delivered entirely via the Internet, but RC is an excellent match for Internet-supported courses. Faculty should concentrate on teaching effectiveness, instruction design strategies, and making judicious, conservative used of educational technologies. With or without technology, instructors should develop learner-centered, authentic instruction. In RC education there are abundant opportunities to employ technology, but RC programs will be well served by distilling a detailed vision of effective educational-technology integration, rather than by continuing to pressure programs and faculty to adopt technology without careful consideration of the value added (or subtracted) by each specific technology.",,Keith B Hopper

Recently published trials have brought controversy with respect to the effectiveness of self-management programmes, especially in patients with high burden of disease and co-morbidities. It may be more challenging to make the patient with high burden of disease a partner and not without risk of serious adverse events. Finally, our health-care delivery has to be well integrated and more coherent, that is, strategic alliance between primary and secondary care, and supported by interdisciplinary teams for patients with high-risk and complex COPD. Clinical practice has to be structured to address COPD throughout the disease spectrum, that is, secondary versus primary, team work, partnership, self-management and continuity of care.",,Jean Bourbeau;Nathalie Saad

This risks neglect, arbitrariness, lack of transparency, and methodological flaws in consideration of resource allocation. We provide recommendations for guideline panels to promote greater transparency and rigor. We suggest focusing on resource allocation issues for only a limited number of recommendations and provide criteria for selecting those in which economic considerations are likely to influence the direction or strength of the recommendation. Panels should involve a health economist to assist with the systematic review and critical interpretation of relevant economic analyses. They should carefully define the intended audience and may consider issuing alternative recommendations when available resources vary widely across target clinical settings. Targeting a limited number of recommendations for the consideration of resource allocation issues, and ensuring methodologically high-quality review, will best serve guideline panels, and the health-care providers and patients they hope to assist.",,Gordon Guyatt;Michael Baumann;Stephen Pauker;Jonathan Halperin;Janet Maurer;Douglas K Owens;Anna N A Tosteson;Brian Carlin;David Gutterman;Martin Prins;Sandra Zelman Lewis;Holger Schünemann

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19665686/,Use of spirometry in the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and efforts to improve quality of care,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. In a patient presenting with respiratory symptoms and risk factors, the recommendation is to perform spirometry to determine the presence of airflow obstruction. However, only about a third of patients with a diagnosis of COPD have spirometry along with their diagnosis, although studies have shown that history and physical examination alone are neither sensitive nor specific for diagnosing COPD. Thus, in current practice, many health care providers continue to diagnose and manage COPD without an accurate diagnosis and assessment of severity based on spirometry. This can contribute to inconsistent care and outcomes, as evidenced by findings of variation in spirometry use and acute exacerbation rates of COPD across geographic regions. As there is increasing evidence that pharmacotherapy for COPD has associated risks, including poor cardiovascular outcomes and pneumonia, it is pertinent to obtain an accurate diagnosis to determine appropriate risk-benefit ratios. Previous studies have shown that spirometry has an impact on COPD management; however, there seem to be barriers to the use of spirometry at the patient, provider, and health system level. Innovative quality improvement approaches, such as the application of the various components of the Chronic Care Model, could improve spirometry use in COPD. Only with accurate diagnosis can appropriate management and evidence-based treatment strategies be applied in practice. Therefore, it is important that we continue efforts to increase the use of spirometry in the diagnosis of COPD.",,Min J Joo;David H Au;Todd A Lee

The different medical specialities are well represented but we observed that only physicians attend MDM. Decisions for straightforward cases are rapidly validated. For more complex clinical situations (25 to 40% of case presentations), the multidisciplinary approach allows to adapt guidelines or to choose alternative treatments.

We chiefly study pathology of the lung, especially about type II pneumocytes. Type II pneumocytes had abundant surface coat on the apical surface containing a specific carbohydrate structure of Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF) antigen. TF antigen is a marker of type II pneumocytes beyond animal species, and can be used for evaluating activity of various interstitial pneumonia as type II pneumocyte index (number/lmm alveolar length). Three dimensional views generated from thick sections of ordinary processed paraffin blocks showed new information of normal and abnormal lung morphology. Type II pneumocytes linearly located along the elastic fibers forming framework of polygonal alveoli, and in usual interstitial pneumonia, destruction of these elastic fibers were observed.

Knowledge of the NIPPV, its indications, contraindications, terms of use and surveillance requires trained teams. This training covers not only the technical but also the hardware, multiple ventilation modes, and interfaces. Other indications being evaluated, such as ventilation in the perioperative period, also require coordination between different actors. The establishment of a specific group of thinking and working around the NIPPV is clearly needed, allowing teams of hospital (emergency department, intensive care unit, pulmonology, anesthesia) to work together. This work deals with different areas: training, equipment, condition of receiving patients in the different services within the constraints of personnel and equipment.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8305711/,Studies of human airways in vitro: a review of the methodology,"The pathophysiology of human airway narrowing is only partly understood. In order to gain more insight in the mechanisms of human lung diseases and potential beneficial therapeutic agents, adequate models are needed. Animal airway models are of limited value since lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are unique to humans and because the mechanisms of airway narrowing differ between species. Therefore, it is important to perform studies on human isolated airways. We describe the models that have been developed to study airway function in vitro, emphasizing human airway preparations. The easily prepared airway strip and ring preparations are described first. The potential damage during preparation and the interference with airway structure are important drawbacks in these preparations. Lung parenchymal strips, described next, were designed in order to study responsiveness of small airways. However, parenchymal strips are anatomically complex, and responsiveness is determined by the relative amounts of airway and vascular smooth muscle. The lack of reproducibility between species and even within one animal limits their usefulness. Airway tube preparations, in which luminal and serosal stimulation can be separated, enable us to study the modulatory role of the airways epithelium in vitro. Furthermore, airway compliance can be measured. In the isolated perfused lung preparation, relationships between the airways and the vascular system are preserved and the interaction between these two systems can be studied. Weight gain due to fluid extravasation is a problem in this model which has not been used yet to study human lungs in vitro. Next, methodological aspects such as tissue handling and storage, recording of responses, removal of the epithelium, and electrical field stimulation are discussed in some detail. Although animal airways tissue can be studied immediately after removal, human tissue is often obtained with some delay. However, this seems tenable since electron microscopy of lung tissue obtained at autopsy showed that recovery of the preparation occurs during incubation of carbogenated Krebs-Henseleit (K-H) buffer. Dissected airways can be stored overnight in cooled K-H buffer until up to 55 hr after resection without losing viability. Commonly used physiological salt solutions which bath the tissue contain osmotic molecules, ions important for contractility, glucose as a substrate, and a bicarbonate-carbon dioxide buffer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,A R Hulsmann;J C de Jongste

The Award is divided into three modules separated into a total of seven clinical standards (in parentheses): 'Clinical' (prevention, early and accurate diagnosis, acute care, chronic care); 'Organisational' (equipment); and 'The Practice Team' (practice learning needs, educational strategy). Assessment is by submission of a written portfolio of 37 pieces of evidence including audit, reflective learning, patient feedback, and significant event analyses. The Award was piloted in five respiratory-interested practices across the UK. The practices reported improvements in practice organisation, practice teamwork, improved process measures such as improvement in quality of spirometry, and improved patient access to patient services. All practices in the UK are being invited to apply for the Award in 2013.

This traditional approach of placing scientific rigor before the patient's reality is changing. There is growing recognition of the importance of integrating patient perspectives (e.g., preferences, expectations, and expanded definitions of what constitutes ""successful"" outcomes) into clinical research to achieve meaningful results for a broader group of stakeholders. This evolution is reflected in the growth of patient-centered organizations and patient advocacy groups that seek to meaningfully integrate patients into the process of prioritizing research needs and creating alliances wherein patients and researchers can partner together to accomplish research goals. In tandem, a growing number of real-world trials (i.e., those with broader, more representative patient populations and routine care pathways) now complement findings from traditional randomized controlled trials and offer new opportunities to design studies that better reflect patients' healthcare preferences and experiences. Patients' perspectives are key determinants of treatment adherence and outcomes, as well as the feasibility and likely value of implementing care pathways. The advent of smartphone and push technologies offer new opportunities for the collection of more patient-centered and ecologically valid patient data, thereby adding new dimensions to meaningfully integrate patients into real-world research.",,Susan J Bartlett;Teresa Barnes;R Andrew McIvor

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25965540/,Historical perspectives of bronchoscopy. Connecting the dots,"The era of bronchoscopy began with Gustav Killian in 1876 when he removed a pork bone from a farmer's airway, using an esophagoscope. Prompted by this accomplishment, Chevalier Jackson, an American otolaryngologist, laid the platform for the modern-day rigid bronchoscope in the early twentieth century. In 1967 Shigeto Ikeda revolutionized the field of bronchoscopy by his innovation of the fiberoptic bronchoscope. Today, bronchoscopy and interventional pulmonology have become an integral part of pulmonary medicine and an established subspecialty. Numerous innovators have furthered the horizons of this technology. In the early 1980s Ko-Pen Wang introduced transbronchial needle aspiration to sample mediastinal lesions while Jean-François Dumon developed methods for laser photoresection and for placing stents thorough the bronchoscope. More recently, application of endobronchial ultrasound and electromagnetic navigation tools has further galvanized the role of bronchoscopy. The success of lung transplantation also belongs in part to flexible bronchoscopy. Today, researchers are looking into treating emphysema as well as asthma, using bronchoscopic techniques. We believe 2015 is a good time to look back on the history of bronchoscopy and to recognize its major milestones.

This review samples the textbook and clinical literature on clinical recognition and diagnosis of asthma from Laënnec (1819) to the National Asthma Education Program (1991), which introduced as a standard for clinical care a set of diagnostic criteria based on laboratory confirmation. There is great consistency among authors in descriptions of the cardinal diagnostic criteria of asthma as episodic dyspnea punctuating periods of normal breathing, generally associated with expiratory wheezing and prolonged expiration. In contrast, there is much greater variation in the formal definitions or explanations of the presumed pathophysiology of the disorder. It is much more difficult to document the actual diagnostic criteria used by practicing clinicians in the past, but these findings indicate a high degree of consistency over 172 years in what was taught and was considered acceptable practice.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29461888/,Some Unanticipated Consequences of Early Cardiac Catheterization. Insights into Pulmonary Pathophysiology,"One of the most interesting unanticipated findings by André Cournand and Dickinson Richards in their groundbreaking studies of cardiac catheterization was the very low pressure in the normal pulmonary circulation. At the time, in the 1940s, the significance of this was not appreciated. For example, in their speeches at the Nobel Prize ceremony, neither of these laureates referred to the low pressure, although they did discuss other features of the pulmonary circulation. It was up to the cardiologist, William Dock, to point out that these low pressures implied a very uneven distribution of blood flow in the lung, and in particular that in the normal upright lung, the blood flow to the apex would be extremely small. Dock went on to argue that this low blood flow at the top of the lung was responsible for the characteristic apical distribution of adult pulmonary tuberculosis. Since that time, it has been recognized that the low pressures in the pulmonary circulation have many implications in pulmonary pathophysiology. For example, if the vascular pressure is further reduced, such as in hemorrhagic shock, gas exchange is seriously affected because of the development of a large alveolar dead space. Furthermore, if humans are subjected to increased acceleration, such as in a high-performance aircraft, the distribution of blood flow becomes extremely abnormal, with much of the lung being completely unperfused. There are also diseases where distribution in the lung is affected by the uneven distribution of blood flow. These include alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and metastatic calcification of the lung.",distribution of blood flow; gas exchange; pulmonary circulation.,John B West

The results of studies analysing this effect vary widely, but the loss of efficacy during these months does seem to be real. Pulmonology is one of medical specialties that generates the least demand for internships and residencies, but it is impossible to determine if this affects the quality of care.

Present profile of Indian pediatric chest services include: asthma, recurrent infections, bronchiectasis, etc. It is expected to change and the emerging pulmonary illnesses include: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV infection) associated pulmonary illnesses, cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, interstitial lung diseases, gastroesophageal reflux diseases, neuromuscular illnesses, sleep disorders, disorders due to malformations and opportunistic pulmonary infections. Respiratory infections constitute major load in pediatric outpatient services and are the leading cause of mortality in under-five children. To reduce morbidity and mortality due to respiratory tract infections, Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) has developed Respiratory Tract Infection Group Education Module (RTIGEMS). After initial increase in prevalence of asthma, it seems to have stabilized now but going by the numbers, it will remain a major health problem in India. Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was always a challenge to pediatricians and with emergence of drug resistant tuberculosis, it is even more challenging. Presently few centers are providing specialized Pediatric pulmonology services in India. There is a need to develop more centers to enhance services including (a) assessment of pulmonary physiology by performing pulmonary function testing in all age groups, (b) improving diagnostic and therapeutic role of bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage, (c) sweat testing, (d) molecular diagnostics for various respiratory illnesses, and (e) utilizing advance imaging and minimally invasive technologies for diagnosis and treatment of respiratory illnesses.

Although evidence regarding the correlation of patient satisfaction with care quality remains mixed, there is an increasing national emphasis on the importance of patient experience in physician reimbursement, credentialing, and public opinion. The introduction of the Affordable Care Act and value-based care purchasing has tied a portion of reimbursement to patient experience surveys and other metrics related to care quality rather than quantity. Through nationally recognized assessments such as the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) surveys and easily accessible websites such as RateMD and Yelp, patient opinion of care quality is more widely available and more important to pulmonary practice than ever before. Physician credentialing may also be impacted by the American Board of Internal Medicine's Maintenance of Certification program and potential future requirements for physicians to assess the patient experience to maintain certification. In the continually evolving health-care delivery, credentialing, and reimbursement climate, a thorough understanding of the increasing importance of patient satisfaction as well as strategies for successfully approaching this issue are essential to modern pulmonary inpatient and outpatient practice management.",,Stacey M Kassutto;Rupal J Shah

The objective of the present study was to develop a multidimensional score that classifies the severity of bronchiectasis according to its prognosis. This is an observational multicentre study including 819 patients diagnosed with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis using high-resolution computed tomography. 397 subjects were selected at random to construct the score while the remaining 422 were used for its validation. The outcome was 5-year all-cause mortality after radiological diagnosis. A logistic regression analysis was used to select the variables included in the final score. The final seven-point score incorporated five dichotomised variables: forced expiratory volume in 1 s % predicted (F, cut-off 50%, maximum value 2 points); age (A, cut-off 70 years, maximum value 2 points); presence of chronic colonisation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (C, dichotomic, maximum value 1 point); radiological extension (E, number of lobes affected, cut-off two lobes, maximum value 1 point); and dyspnoea (D, cut-off grade II on the Medical Research Council scale, maximum value 1 point) to construct the FACED score.

Following a baseline audit, we performed an intervention to enhance adherence to these guidelines. We then performed a postintervention audit. At baseline, there were different levels of guideline adherence depending on the specialty of the clinician inserting chest tubes. Interventions to improve adherence were hampered by limited access to non-respiratory teams. Thus, improvements in response to intervention were also specialty specific. Overall, procedures performed by respiratory medicine had higher adherence rates compared with those performed by non-respiratory teams.

Airway obstruction was defined as forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1))/forced vital capacity below the lower limit of normal and staged for severity on the basis of FEV(1) % predicted. The age-adjusted prevalence rates of obstruction (stages I-IV) were rather similar in both surveys in males (4.7 versus 4.3%; p = 0.25), but were almost significantly higher in females in the later survey (2.2 versus 3.1%; p = 0.06).

They are derived from a systematic literature search, a census of active European centres, a Delphi conference and expert consensus. This article details each step of a SIC, including safety requirements, techniques for delivering agents, and methods for assessing and interpreting bronchial responses. The limitations of the procedure are also discussed. Testing should only be carried out in hospitals where physicians and healthcare professionals have appropriate expertise. Tests should always include a control challenge, a gradual increase of exposure to the suspected agent, and close monitoring of the patient during the challenge and for at least 6 h afterwards. In expert centres, excessive reactions provoked by SIC are rare. A positive response is defined by a fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s ≥ 15% from baseline. Equivocal reactions can sometimes be clarified by finding changes in nonspecific bronchial responsiveness, sputum eosinophils or exhaled nitric oxide. The sensitivity and specificity of SIC are high but not easily quantified, as the method is usually used as the reference standard for the diagnosis of occupational asthma.",,Olivier Vandenplas;Hille Suojalehto;Tor B Aasen;Xaver Baur;P Sherwood Burge;Frederic de Blay;David Fishwick;Jennifer Hoyle;Piero Maestrelli;Xavier Muñoz;Gianna Moscato;Joaquin Sastre;Torben Sigsgaard;Katri Suuronen;Jolanta Walusiak-Skorupa;Paul Cullinan;ERS Task Force on Specific Inhalation Challenges with Occupational Agents

As much as any single individual, he was responsible for the concept of intensive and multidisciplinary respiratory care. In the 1960s and 1970s, he made key observations and introduced pioneering therapies in the ICU and in the home. He was the first to describe and name ARDS and to show how to use PEEP to treat life-threatening hypoxemia. He was one of the first anywhere to organize a pulmonary rehabilitation program and to show the beneficial effects of long-term oxygen therapy in COPD. Dr Petty emphasized the importance of practical, hands-on respiratory care education for both physicians and non-physicians using a collaborative team approach. He targeted educational activities and practical resources specifically to patients, and he showed how researchers and clinicians could interact responsibly with innovators in industry to the benefit of both. His life and career provide 6 important lessons for respiratory clinicians today and in the future: (1) whatever their roles, RTs and other clinicians in this field need to be experts in its core areas, such as mechanical ventilation, ARDS, and COPD; (2) respiratory care is a team activity: every member is important, and all the members need to communicate well and work together; (3) education needs to be targeted to those in the best position to benefit the patient, including primary care providers and family members; (4) everyone in the field needs to understand the important role of the respiratory care industry and to deal with it responsibly; (5) it must never be forgotten that it is all about the patient; and (6) respiratory care should be exciting and fun.",ARDS; COPD; PEEP; acute respiratory failure; education; history; long-term oxygen therapy; mechanical ventilation; patients; pulmonary rehabilitation; respiratory care.,David J Pierson

Pooled data at the final study week (n = 8,188) from three budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy studies which measured ACQ-5 were stratified according to GINA or GOAL criteria and ACQ-5 score distribution. The percentages of patients with a controlled/partly controlled week (GINA), totally/well-controlled week (GOAL) and range of ACQ-5 cut-off points were compared. Patients with GINA controlled, partly controlled and uncontrolled asthma had mean ACQ-5 scores of 0.43, 0.75 and 1.62, respectively. Patients with GOAL totally controlled, well-controlled and uncontrolled asthma had ACQ-5 scores of 0.39, 0.78 and 1.63. The kappa measure of agreement was 0.80 for GINA and GOAL criteria, and 0.63 for GINA controlled/partly controlled and ACQ-5 <1.00.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24431072/,[Prolonged weaning: S2k-guideline published by the German Respiratory Society],"Mechanical ventilation (MV) is an essential part of modern intensive care medicine. MV is performed in patients with severe respiratory failure caused by insufficiency of the respiratory muscles and/or lung parenchymal disease when/after other treatments, i. e. oxygen, body position, secretion management, medication or non invasive ventilation have failed.In the majority of ICU patients weaning is routine and does not present any problems. Nevertheless 40-50 % of the time during mechanical ventilation is spent on weaning. About 20 % of patients need continued MV despite resolution of the conditions which originally precipitated the need for MV.There maybe a combination of reasons; chronic lung disease, comorbidities, age and conditions acquired in ICU (critical care neuromyopathy, psychological problems). According to an International Consensus Conference the criteria for ""prolonged weaning"" are fulfilled if patients fail at least three weaning attempts or require more than 7 days of weaning after the first spontaneous breathing trial. Prolonged weaning is a challenge. An inter- and multi-disciplinary approach is essential for weaning success. Complex, difficult to wean patients who fulfill the criteria for ""prolonged weaning"" can still be successfully weaned in specialised weaning units in about 50% of cases.In patients with unsuccessful weaning, invasive mechanical ventilation has to be arranged either at home or in a long term care facility.This S2-guideline was developed because of the growing number of patients requiring prolonged weaning. It is an initiative of the German Respiratory Society (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Pneumologie und Beatmungsmedizin e. V., DGP) in cooperation with other societies engaged in the field.The guideline is based on a systematic literature review of other guidelines, the Cochrane Library and PubMed.The consensus project was chaired by the Association of Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftlichen Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften, AWMF) based on a formal interdisciplinary process applying the Delphi-concept. The guideline covers the following topics: Definitions, epidemiology, weaning categories, pathophysiology, the spectrum of treatment strategies, the weaning unit, discharge from hospital on MV and recommendations for end of life decisions. Special issues relating to paediatric patients were considered at the end of each chapter.The target audience for this guideline are intensivists, pneumologists, anesthesiologists, internists, cardiologists, surgeons, neurologists, pediatricians, geriatricians, palliative care clinicians, nurses, physiotherapists, respiratory therapists, ventilator manufacturers.The aim of the guideline is to disseminate current knowledge about prolonged weaning to all interested parties.

We sought to evaluate the quality and capacity for respiratory care in low- and lower-middle-income countries, using Nigeria as a case study. We obtained details of the respiratory practice of consultants and senior residents (fellows) in respiratory medicine in Nigeria via a semistructured questionnaire administered to physician attendees at the 2013 National Congress of the Nigerian Thoracic Society. Out of 76 society-registered members, 48 attended the congress, 40 completed the questionnaire, and 35 provided complete data (73% adjusted response rate). Respondents provided information on the process and costs of respiratory medicine training and facility, equipment, and supply capacities at the institutions they represented. Approximately 83% reported working at a tertiary level (teaching) hospital; 91% reported capacity for sputum smear analysis for acid alcohol-fast bacilli, 37% for GeneXpert test cartridges, and 20% for BACTEC liquid sputum culture. Only 34% of respondents could perform full spirometry on patients, and none had the capacity for performing a methacholine challenge test or for measuring the diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide. We estimated the proportion of registered respiratory physicians to the national population at 1 per 2.3 million individuals. Thirteen states with an estimated combined population of 57.7 million offer no specialist respiratory services. Barriers to development of this capacity include the high cost of training.

It provides a basis for national guidelines on contact investigation and tuberculosis outbreak management, and should support countries and tuberculosis control managers in evaluating and revising national policies. A review of existing guidelines, a literature search, several meetings and consultation with experts were used to formulate and grade recommendations for action during contact investigation. Available tests to identify individuals with latent infection with M. tuberculosis are designed to identify immune response against mycobacterial antigens and have variable predictive value for the likelihood to develop active tuberculosis in different populations. Contact investigation should therefore be limited to situations with a clear likelihood of transmission or to those with a higher probability of developing active tuberculosis, for instance, young children and immunocompromised persons. A risk assessment-based approach is recommended, where the need to screen contacts is prioritised on the basis of the infectiousness of the index case, intensity of exposure and susceptibility of contacts.",,C G M Erkens;M Kamphorst;I Abubakar;G H Bothamley;D Chemtob;W Haas;G B Migliori;H L Rieder;J-P Zellweger;C Lange

In this study we analyzed FSN of medical devices exclusively serving for diagnostics or treatment in pulmonology (e.g. nebulizers, oxygen concentrators, pulse oximeters, lung function analyzers, and non-active devices for treatment). FSCA and FSN publicized by BfArM in 2005-2013 were analyzed in respect to the MEDDEV 2.12-1 rev 8. In total 41 FSCA were publicized for the included products. German and English FSN were found in 36/35 cases, respectively. FSN were clearly characterized as FSN in 22/20 cases and declaration of the type of action was found in 27/26 cases, respectively. Product names were provided in all cases. Lot numbers or other information for product characterization were available in 7/8 and 26/24 cases, respectively. Detailed information regarding FSCA and product malfunction were found in 27/33 and 36/35 cases, respectively. Information on product related risks with previous use of the affected product was provided in 24/23 cases. In 34/34 cases manufacturers provided information to mitigate product related risks. Requests to pass FSN to persons needing awareness were found in 10/14 cases. Contact data were provided in 30/30 cases. Confirmation that the Competent Authority was informed was found in 12/14 cases and in 19/18 cases a customer confirmation was included. The obtained data suggest that there is an increasing annual number of FSCA and most FSN fulfill the criteria of MEDDEV 2.12-1 rev 8. However, there are differences between German and English FSN, e.g. regarding the distribution to persons needing awareness, missing statement that the Competent Authority was informed and missing customer confirmation. Due to the importance of FSN for reduction of product related risks in FSCA type and content of FSN should be further improved.",,Jürgen Hannig;Rüdiger Siekmeier

Population-based samples of adults aged ≥40 yrs (n = 9,390) from 14 countries completed a questionnaire and spirometry. We compared the screening efficiency of differently staged algorithms that used questionnaire data and/or peak expiratory flow (PEF) data to identify persons at risk for COPD and, hence, needing confirmatory spirometry. Separate algorithms were fitted for moderate/severe COPD and for severe COPD. We estimated the cost of each algorithm in 1,000 people. For moderate/severe COPD, use of questionnaire data alone permitted high sensitivity (97%) but required confirmatory spirometry in 80% of participants. Use of PEF necessitated confirmatory spirometry in only 19-22% of subjects, with 83-84% sensitivity. For severe COPD, use of PEF achieved 91-93% sensitivity, requiring confirmatory spirometry in <9% of participants. Cost analysis suggested that a staged screening algorithm using only PEF initially, followed by confirmatory spirometry as needed, was the most cost-effective case-finding strategy. Our results support the use of PEF as a simple, cost-effective initial screening tool for conducting COPD case-finding in adults aged ≥40 yrs. These findings should be validated in real-world settings such as the primary care environment.",,Anamika Jithoo;Paul L Enright;Peter Burney;A Sonia Buist;Eric D Bateman;Wan C Tan;Michael Studnicka;Filip Mejza;Suzanne Gillespie;William M Vollmer;BOLD Collaborative Research Group

As measures of ventilation distribution inhomogeneity, they offer complementary information to standard lung function tests, such as spirometry, as well as improved feasibility across wider age ranges and improved sensitivity in the detection of early lung damage. These benefits have led to a resurgence of interest in these techniques from manufacturers, clinicians and researchers, yet detailed guidelines for washout equipment specifications, test performance and analysis are lacking. This manuscript provides recommendations about these aspects, applicable to both the paediatric and adult testing environment, whilst outlining the important principles that are essential for the reader to understand. These recommendations are evidence based, where possible, but in many places represent expert opinion from a working group with a large collective experience in the techniques discussed. Finally, the important issues that remain unanswered are highlighted. By addressing these important issues and directing future research, the hope is to facilitate the incorporation of these promising tests into routine clinical practice.",,Paul D Robinson;Philipp Latzin;Sylvia Verbanck;Graham L Hall;Alexander Horsley;Monika Gappa;Cindy Thamrin;Hubertus G M Arets;Paul Aurora;Susanne I Fuchs;Gregory G King;Sooky Lum;Kenneth Macleod;Manuel Paiva;Jane J Pillow;Sarath Ranganathan;Felix Ratjen;Florian Singer;Samatha Sonnappa;Janet Stocks;Padmaja Subbarao;Bruce R Thompson;Per M Gustafsson

We classified 1,885 operated patients with lung cancer, reported to the Cancer Registry of Norway (Oslo, Norway) from 2001 to 2005, according to the sixth and the seventh edition of the TNM system. We compared survival differences adjusting for known prognostic factors. Furthermore, we evaluated the overall predictive ability of both editions using Harrell's concordance index. Survival curves by stage for each of the editions were similar; however, a better description of stage IIIB was observed in the seventh edition. Survival rates of T1b and T2a tumours were similar (log rank p = 0.94). The concordance index was 0.68 for both editions, indicating no overall difference in their predictive accuracy. In the seventh edition, 211 (29%) stage IB patients migrated to stage II and 161 (48%) patients migrated from stage IIB to IIA. Stage migrations could change the treatment for up to 326 (17.3%) of the study patients. The seventh edition did not improve the overall predictive ability of the TNM system; however, the new classification implies changes in treatment for nearly one-fifth of the cases. The implications of the seventh TNM edition for the outcomes of patients should be studied further.",,T-E Strand;H Rostad;T Wentzel-Larsen;C von Plessen
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24232698/,LUNOKID: can numerical American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society quality criteria replace visual inspection of spirometry?,"The gold standard for assessing quality of forced expiratory manoeuvres is visual inspection by an expert. American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society numerical quality criteria (NQC) include back-extrapolated volume (BEV), repeatability and forced expiratory time (FET). Equipment currently available provides feedback tempting the investigator to use NQC as pass-fail criterion. To investigate whether using NQC instead of visual acceptability is a valid option, we analysed data from a multicentre national reference study in Germany of children aged 4-18 years. Spirometry was performed under field conditions. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to assess performance of BEV, repeatability, FET and a combination thereof in relation to visual acceptability. We included data from 3133 healthy Caucasians in the analyses; 72% delivered at least two visually acceptable manoeuvres. Of these, 59% would have been rejected based on combined NQC, mainly because the FET criterion was not feasible. Specificity of the NQC was generally low (BEV 10%, repeatability 30% and FET 50%). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that a combination of the three measures could reach at best a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 56%. We conclude that visual control is mandatory and NQC may help obtain the best possible results, but a fixed cut-off for FET should be abandoned.",,Christine Müller-Brandes;Ursula Krämer;Monika Gappa;Gabriele Seitner-Sorge;Anke Hüls;Andrea von Berg;Barbara Hoffmann;Antje Schuster;Sabina Illi;Matthias Wisbauer;Dietrich Berdel

We assessed spirometric records from 17 572 subjects (49.5% females), aged 18-85 years, from hospitals in Australia and Poland. We calculated predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced expiratory volume (FVC), FEV1/FVC and lower limits of normal (LLN) using European Community for Steel and Coal (ECSC), National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III and GLI 2012 equations. Obstruction was defined as FEV1/FVC<LLN and a restrictive pattern as FEV1/FVC>LLN and FVC<LLN. Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 2 and higher was defined as FEV1/FVC<0.70 and FEV1 <80% pred. GLI 2012 equations produce similar predicted values for FEV1 and FVC compared with NHANES, but produce larger values than ECSC. Differences in the LLN lead to an important increase in the prevalence rate of a low FVC compared to ECSC, and a significant decrease compared to NHANES prediction equations. Adopting GLI 2012 equations has small effects on the prevalence rate of airway obstruction. GOLD stages 2-4 lead to >20% underdiagnosis of airway obstruction up to the age of 55 years and to 16-23% overdiagnosis in older subjects.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24081761/,An official American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society policy statement: disparities in respiratory health,"Health disparities, defined as a significant difference in health between populations, are more common for diseases of the respiratory system than for those of other organ systems, because of the environmental influence on breathing and the variation of the environment among different segments of the population. The lowest social groups are up to 14 times more likely to have respiratory diseases than are the highest. Tobacco smoke, air pollution, environmental exposures, and occupational hazards affect the lungs more than other organs and occur disproportionately in ethnic minorities and those with lower socioeconomic status. Lack of access to quality healthcare contributes to disparities. The executive committees of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) established a writing committee to develop a policy on health disparities. The document was reviewed, edited, and approved by their full executive committees and boards of directors of the societies. This document expresses a policy to address health disparities by promoting scientific inquiry and training, disseminating medical information and best practices, and monitoring and advocating for public respiratory health. The ERS and the ATS have strong international commitments and work with leaders from governments, academia, and other organisational bodies to address and reduce avoidable health inequalities. Their training initiatives improve the function of healthcare systems and health equality. Both the ATS and the ERS support all aspects of this document, confer regularly, and act together when possible, but the activities to bring about change may vary because of the differences in the continents where the two organisations carry out most of their activities.

Pulmonologists intending to use the method perceived a more supportive social environment in working with it and were more convinced of their ability to use it. Overall, pulmonologists were not convinced that the method would result in more patients quitting, and were pessimistic about their ability to use it.

Pulmonary fibrosis, therefore, represents a critical unmet medical need. Progress in research over the past 30 years has been encouraging. This work, which has been funded by governments, charitable trusts, industries and patient groups, has resulted in clinical trials testing novel drugs, giving hope to patients. In late September 2012, representatives from academia, industry and funding agencies met at the 17th International Colloquium on Airway and Lung Fibrosis to discuss state-of-the-art knowledge of pulmonary fibrosis. This manuscript summarises the outcomes of the meeting, highlighting the most relevant results and discoveries. It also attempts to provide a roadmap for future studies. It is hoped that such a roadmap may help interested parties to generate new research, which will be vital to continued progress. We are encouraged by the commitment expressed by all participants at this meeting and the shared vision of promoting future progress through international collaboration, the pooling of valuable resources, and the involvement of a new generation of physicians and scientists.",,Luca Richeldi;Harold R Collard;Roland M du Bois;Gisli Jenkins;Martin Kolb;Toby M Maher;Ganesh Raghu;Carlo Vancheri;Geoffrey J Laurent

It is unknown whether a one-time evaluation by asthma experts, without long-term supervision by a specialised team, provides favourable outcomes. We evaluated asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire; ACQ), quality-of-life (Asthma-related Quality of Life Questionnaire; AQLQ) and HCU before and 1 year after a 1-day visit programme in a severe asthma centre, including a multidisciplinary assessment resulting in a personalised management plan to be implemented by patients own pulmonologists.40 uncontrolled asthma patients completed questionnaires (ACQ, AQLQ, HCU) at baseline, and 6 and 12 months follow-up.ACQ improved from 2.6 (interquartile range 1.7-3.2) to 1.8 (1.2-3.2) (p=0.003) and AQLQ from 4.8 (4.0-5.2) to 5.3 (4.4-6.0) (p<0.001). We found a reduction in patients with ≥2 exacerbations (95% versus 17%; p<0.001), ≥1 emergency room visit (78% versus 37%; p<0.001) and ≥1 hospitalisation (47% versus 10%; p=0.001).Evaluation of uncontrolled asthma patients in a 1-day visit programme in a severe asthma centre resulted in significant improvements in asthma control, quality-of-life and healthcare use after 1 year.

The technique is currently included in pulmonology teaching programs. Physicians and nurses should understand the devices they use and the interaction between the patient and the ventilator in terms of respiratory mechanics, adaptation, and synchronization. We present a readily assembled lung simulator for teaching purposes that is reproducible and interactive. Based on a bag-in-box system, this model allows the concepts of respiratory mechanics in mechanical ventilation to be taught simply and graphically in that it reproduces the patterns of restriction, obstruction, and the presence of leaks. It is possible to demonstrate how each ventilation parameter acts and the mechanical response elicited.

The clinical and pathological features of acute lung injury (ALI) from SARS appear indistinguishable from ALI from other causes. The mainstay of treatments for ALI remains supportive. Patients with ALI from SARS who require mechanical ventilation should receive a lung protective, low tidal volume strategy. Adjuvant treatments recommended include prevention of venous thromboembolism, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and semirecumbent positioning during ventilation. Based on previous experience in Canada, infection control resources and protocols were recommended. Leadership structure, communication, training, and morale are an essential aspect of SARS management. A multicenter, placebo-controlled trial of corticosteroids for late SARS is justified because of widespread clinical use and uncertainties about relative risks and benefits. Studies of combined pathophysiologic endpoints were recommended, with mortality as a secondary endpoint.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17898014/,Measuring inspiratory muscle strength in neuromuscular disease: one test or two?,"Inspiratory muscle strength monitoring is crucial in patients with neuromuscular disorders. The sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) and maximal inspiratory pressure (P(I,max)) are usually measured. The present study investigated whether the test yielding the best value at baseline continued to yield the best value during follow-up. The present study included 25 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and 61 with myotonic muscular dystrophy (MMD). SNIP and P(I,max) were measured at baseline and then annually. At baseline, SNIP was lower than P(I,max) in 20 (80%) DMD patients and 32 (52%) MMD patients. During follow-up in DMD patients, changes in the best method always occurred from SNIP to P(I,max). In MMD patients, when SNIP was better than P(I,max) at baseline, SNIP was usually (88%) better during follow-up, whereas a better P(I,max) than SNIP at baseline was frequently (50%) followed by a shift to SNIP. Maximal inspiratory pressure may be sufficient for monitoring inspiratory muscle function in Duchenne muscular dystrophy adults. In myotonic muscular dystrophy, the marked variability in the test yielding the best value at baseline indicates a need for performance of both tests at baseline. However, when sniff nasal inspiratory pressure measurement yields the best value at baseline, using sniff nasal inspiratory pressure alone during follow-up may be appropriate.",,N Terzi;D Orlikowski;C Fermanian;M Lejaille;L Falaize;A Louis;J-C Raphael;B Fauroux;F Lofaso

The aim of this study was to compare Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines with the Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) and the Asthma Control Test (ACT) in detecting uncontrolled asthma in children. 145 children with asthma filled in a web-based daily diary card for 4 weeks on symptoms, use of rescue medication and limitations of activities, followed by either the C-ACT or ACT. For predicting uncontrolled asthma, score cut-off points of 19 were used for C-ACT and ACT. According to GINA guidelines, asthma was uncontrolled in 71 (51%) children and completely controlled in 19 (14%) children. The area under the curve in the receiver operating characteristic curves for C-ACT and ACT versus GINA guidelines were 0.89 and 0.92, respectively. Cut-off points of 19 for C-ACT and ACT resulted in a sensitivity of 33% and 66% in predicting uncontrolled asthma, respectively.

To evaluate the demographic characteristics of respirologists in practice, appraise current respirology manpower and ascertain the utilization of invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (interventional pulmonology), a mail survey of all Canadian respirologists was conducted. The questionnaires were completed by 62% (n=355) of 573 possible participants. Of the respirologists who responded, 69.2% were younger than 50 years of age, 70.3% had been in practice for fewer than 20 years, 64.4% were in full- or part-time academic practice, and 72.9% were based in urban centres with a catchment population of more than 250,000. The current ratio of respirologists to population in Canada, assuming a total population of 31,000,000, is 1:54,101. In the present survey, only 68.3% respirologists practised clinical respirology for 50% or more of their time, and half (49.5%) of respirologists devoted more than 50% of their time on nonrespirology or nonclinical activities. Thus, the more precise respirologist to population ratio appears to be 1:81,000. The current ratio meets the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada recommendations, and the current training programs meet present manpower requirements. With respect to the procedures performed, most specialists carried out bedside procedures and flexible bronchoscopy; a much smaller number did invasive procedures such as rigid bronchoscopy (20.8%), transbronchial needle biopsy of lung (43%), transbronchial biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes (38%), therapeutic bronchoscopy using laser, cryotherapy and stents (8.7%), transthoracic needle biopsy (22.2%) and thoracoscopy (11.3%).

In the pilot study applying this model to two pulmonary medicine fellowship programs, several important observations were made: (1) faculty members may not have an accurate perception of the fellow's actual clinical experience, (2) faculty impressions of the fellow's experience often do not correspond to their own conception of an adequate clinical experience, (3) interprogram variability exists, (4) pulmonary fellows may have inadequate experience with certain invasive procedures. These observations suggest that wilder application of such a model could provide valuable information to program directors and subspecialty boards.

Of the 535 respondents (67% of those invited to respond), the responses of 388 certified and 94 trained but not board-certified pulmonologists were included in the results. The characteristics of certified and non-certified respondents were the same for most survey questions. Clinical activities occupy 73 +/- 29% of professional time. Most pulmonologists work in urban, inner city, or suburban settings and 85% are affiliated with a medical school. One third are in private practice. As a group, research activities occupy less than 15% of their time. Most pediatric pulmonologists maintain a referral practice and use physician extenders to provide care.

To address the shortcomings of past guidelines, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) published recommendations for trustworthy guidelines, effectively setting the ""gold standard"" for what constitutes a high-quality guideline. Along with many other groups that develop guidelines, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) is rapidly evolving processes for development and implementation to meet many of the IOM standards. This Pulmonary Perspective describes the rapidly changing landscape of clinical practice guidelines, the role of the ATS in this landscape, and the activities the ATS is engaged in to ensure that the guidelines it produces are of the highest quality with the broadest impact.",,Colin R Cooke;Michael K Gould

For the most part, the Society's administrative and medical-scientific interests evolved in an orderly fashion, but two ""revolutions"" took place that should be remembered. What ultimately metamorphosed into the ATS in 1960 began in 1905 as the 34-member American Sanatorium Association, which in 1915 became the medical section of the National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis (NASPT). In 1918, the NASPT became the National Tuberculosis Association and in 1939, the ASA became the American Trudeau Society, cosmetic revisions having no effect on either the medical section-parent relationship or the one-disease orientation of both organizations. After World War II, the narrow focus of the ATS on tuberculosis was progressively enlarged through coalescence of several factors that transformed the practice of pulmonary medicine: the growth of intensive care units and pulmonary function laboratories and the advent of fiberoptic bronchoscopy; the rise of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer coincident with the withering of tuberculosis; and the arrival of pulmonary physician-scientists who sought enrichment through a professional society. The newcomers found a home in the ATS, but it was slow to fulfill their needs for scientific communication and administrative responsibility. The first revolution, the formation of Scientific Assemblies, got the job done quickly and well, as described in Part 1 of this perspective. The second revolution, separation from the American Lung Association, is described in Part 2.",,John F Murray;Fran Du Melle;Philip C Hopewell

Only 26% of practicing pulmonologists currently do all the procedures required for board certification in pulmonary medicine. For each of 13 specific procedures, the number reported done in the past year was generally unrelated to practice factors. Many respondents who learned procedures in practice did so without formal training or supervision. Respondents' recommendations regarding numbers of procedures required to attain or maintain competence did not vary greatly. Pulmonologists vary considerably in the types of procedures they do.

It was intended to replace the measurement of the maximum breathing capacity, a difficult and tiring manoeuvre. A similar approach was later followed in the USA by Gaensler, who proposed the ""timed vital capacity"" in 1951. The name CPUE was changed to ""volume expiratoire maximum seconde"" (VEMS) by a group of European experts, who met in Paris on February 13, 1954, whereas the expression ""forced expiratory volume"" was adopted by the British Thoracic Society in 1957. Despite numerous attempts to examine the forced expiration in a different manner, the VEMS and/or forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) remain, after 50 yrs the main variables used daily by the respiratory physician.

For me this occurred, with excellent mentoring and supervision, as first a descriptive ""looking"" approach to identify host immunity components in a variety of animal models and then manipulating these models to mimic disease processes, focusing on the respiratory tract and innate immunity. Next, we moved to characterize these host immunity components in normal humans, before applying these to in vitro and clinical illness situations for patients. The intent of this research sequence was to better describe and manipulate immunopathology relevant to disease. A bench-to-patient approach, mostly descriptive and ""looking,"" was the path. I have illustrated these steps with applicable references. Now seems such a crucial time to further scientific knowledge and to foster personalized medicine, despite a period of financial restraint.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17134527/,Zen and the art of nomenclature maintenance: a revised approach to respiratory symbols and terminology,"In this paper we point out that there are different entities involved in the mathematical descriptions, or models, of the respiratory system: variables and parameters. These, in turn, can be divided into different types. Variables can be primary variables, difference variables, or change variables. Difference variables express the difference between primary variables measured simultaneously at 2 locations. Change variables are primary variables measured relative to fixed reference values. Parameters that appear in input-output models that are valid over a wide range of inputs can be interpreted as properties. There are 3 levels of properties, depending on the detail included in the model. If the model specifically includes the geometry of the system and the substances of which the system is composed, then the parameters in the model are material properties. If the model includes the general structures that compose the system, the parameters are structural properties. And if the model describes the behavior of the system as a whole with no detail included pertaining to internal makeup, then the parameters can be considered system properties. Parameters that appear in mathematical descriptions of input and/or output wave shapes can be interpreted as waveform characteristics. General waveform characteristics are attributes of arbitrary inputs and/or outputs. However, in those special cases in which a system is subjected to a well-defined, specialized input and the output waveform is described mathematically (even if only at a single point), the parameter(s) in such descriptions can be considered system response characteristic(s). We suggest that the symbols and names given to these various entities should follow well-defined guidelines that distinguish among the entity types. These guidelines should include symbol and name conventions and also sign conventions and expected unit ranges on appropriate measurement scales. One such set of conventions would be as follows. Italicize all variables. Use upper-case for primary (absolute) variables. Use the delta symbol (Delta) to denote difference variables (difference between 2 locations). Use lower-case letters for change variables (change relative to a reference, or operating, point) and for abbreviations (eg, ""pl"" for ""pleural""). Use upper-case characters to represent the initial letters of words (eg, ""AO"" for ""airway opening""). Make bold nonitalicized groups of letters used for properties (upper-case, lower-case, multi-height). Do not bold or italicize groups of letters used for characteristics (upper-case, lower-case, multi-height). Compound symbols are those that include subscripts and/or superscripts. Subscripts following a symbol indicate location, direction, or index (time); if more than one subscript, separate them by commas. Superscripts following a symbol indicate a component, or it can indicate a power if the symbol is enclosed in parentheses. Letters on the same line as initial letter but in smaller type are part of the generic symbol. Arguments are enclosed in parentheses; parentheses are also used to isolate compound symbols from powers or additional subscripts. Adapt currently standard symbols to retain their identity but conform to the above conventions. The sign of an entity is always dictated by and its interpretation is based on the model in which the entity is used. Units used are consistent with measurement resolution and accuracy. Copious examples of the applications of this set of suggested conventions are given in the text and in 4 tables. Our hope is that the presentation of these suggestions will start a dialogue in the field and will influence journal and book publishers to adopt a consistent set of conventions for the names and symbols used for respiratory-system-related terms.",,Frank P Primiano Jr;Robert L Chatburn

In the limited number of vaccinated children, bacteremia were detectable up to 9 months; the phase of immune synthesis continued in most children up to 3 years. The study has demonstrated that a complex of phagocytic tests may be used for the early diagnosis of tuberculous infection, for the evaluation of a tuberculous process and antituberculous immunity.",,L P Sanakoeva;A D Koriukina;V A Chereshnev;V A Aksenova

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14513487/,[Treatment of pulmonary diseases from the 20th to the 21st century],"In the 21st century, the treatment of pulmonary diseases will undergo fundamental change. The treatment of patients in general and of pulmonary diseases in particular will transcend the vertical and fragmented approach based on analytical and reductionistic disease concepts to emphasize holistic care given by an interdisciplinary team. Extended life expectancies, understandably ones that represent significant progress in 20th century medicine, will lead to considerably higher costs in the healthcare system and to a redistribution of therapeutic resources. Healthcare centers will form that are better equipped to handle the true needs of the patients and provide better continuity of care. Likewise, this nascent century will bring forth one irreversible sociological change, namely the better informed and better educated patient who, by demanding access to medical information in order to profit from modern technological advances, will become an active partner of the healthcare professionals. The Swiss Lung League, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year, has been able to tackle the real pulmonological challenges of the 20th century by taking on a pioneering role in the fight against tuberculosis, smoking and setting benchmarks by providing patients with sophisticated respiratory technology like mechanical home ventilation. Unlike other medical disciplines, it recognized early on the importance of working within a healthcare network. Its strength derives from a synergy of the cantonal leagues' medical and social commitment and the Pulmonological Society's scientific support. Indeed, this trend can be observed all over Europe and the USA. This partnership is self-perpetuating and has adapted its own mentalities and structures to scientific progress and the changing needs of pulmonary patients.",,J M Tschopp
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8904279/,Diagnosis and therapy of acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults: an international survey,"In an attempt to identify the range of opinions influencing the diagnosis and therapy of patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a postal survey was mailed to 3,164 physician members of the American Thoracic Society Critical Care Assembly. The questionnaire asked opinions regarding the factors important in the diagnosis of ARDS and its treatment. Thirty-one percent of physicians surveyed responded within 4 weeks, the vast majority of which were board certified or eligible in Internal Medicine, Pulmonary Disease, and/or Critical Care Medicine. A known predisposing cause, measure of oxygenation efficiency, and a chest radiograph depicting pulmonary edema were reported to be the most important criteria for a clinical and research diagnosis of ARDS. Lung compliance and bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophil or protein content were reportedly less important. The initial treatment of patients with ARDS was reported to be most commonly accomplished using volume-cycled ventilation in the assist/control mode. Nearly half the responders reported using lower tidal volumes (5 to 9 mL/kg) than the traditionally recommended 10 to 15 mL/kg. Most respondents indicated they have intentionally allowed CO2 retention. On average, oxygen toxicity was thought to begin at an FIO2 between 0.5 and 0.6. It was reported that modest levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were used in incremental fashion as FiO2 requirements increased. Perceived indications for insertion of pulmonary artery catheters and compensation of the effects of PEEP on the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure varied widely among the responders. We conclude that reported practice patterns regarding the care of ARDS patients vary widely even within a relatively homogenous group of critical care practitioners.",,L C Carmichael;P M Dorinsky;S B Higgins;G R Bernard;W D Dupont;B Swindell;A P Wheeler

The greatest expansion of its development took place in the second half of the 20th century. The oficial start of clinical haematology dates from 1956, when the Department of Haematology was founded within the framework of the Internal Medicine Clinic in Skopje. In the beginning, haematology represented a form of virtual sub-specialty, but its expansion was so progressive and rapid that it reached the highest peaks of Yugoslav haematology in those times. The period from 1968 to 1979 was a period of integral development of haematology and blood-transfusion science in Macedonia. Nowadays, the autonomous Public Health Institution, the University Hematology Clinic, is a unique healthcare, educational and scientific establishment in the Republic of Macedonia in its field of work. The diagnostics algorithm comprises cyto-morphologic and cyto-chemical analysis, through immunologic characterization with the assistance of a flow cytometer, to sophisticated molecular analysis for detecting genetic abnormalities. The therapeutic approach is based upon modern poly-haemotherapeutic protocols, application of monoclonal antibodies, immuno-modulatory agents, molecular target therapy and the use of alogeneic and autologous transplantation of fresh bone-marrow and frozen haemopoietic stem-cells. The current motto of the Haematology Clinic is: always help those who seek help, provide precise and early diagnostics, and apply all up-to-date therapeutic strategies, scientific research, continual education and day-to-day implementation of the latest achievements in the field of haematology in daily practice.",,I Panovska-Stavridis;L Cevreska

Of the 239 admissions randomised, 192 were suitable for study. Results were compared with those from a study in the same hospitals using the same methods in 1978. The age and sex of the patients and their smoking history, duration of asthma, and hospital attendance were similar in 1978 and 1985. A much smaller proportion of patients presented with symptoms of over seven days' duration in 1985 (8.5%) than in 1978 (26%). The inpatient management of asthma appears to have improved in both thoracic and general units, with more thorough functional assessments, more frequent performance of relevant investigations (arterial blood gases and peak expiratory flow rates) and more frequent use of recommended treatment (nebulised bronchodilators, oral and intravenous corticosteroids). Less difference was found in 1985 between units with a specialist thoracic interest and those without, though some differences remained in 1985 in monitoring of peak expiratory flow rate and arterial blood gases, outpatient prescribing, and follow up arrangements. Inhaled preventive medication was prescribed more frequently than in 1978. In 1985 there was a 56% increase in admissions for asthma. The proportion of severely ill patients was similar to that in 1978, but in the most severe functional grade mean arterial carbon dioxide tension was higher in 1985 and more patients were ventilated. Our results suggest that hospital management by thoracic and general physicians has improved over the period 1978-85.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10444949/,[Diagnostic pneumology using model aerosols],"Clearance of Aerosol Particles from the Airways: Measurement of the efficiency and kinetics of particle clearance from the airways is dependent on the site of particle deposition within the lungs. Insoluble particles deposited in the alveolar region are mainly cleared by macrophages over a period of hundreds of days, whereas particles from the tracheobronchial airways are mainly cleared within hours or days by mucociliary clearance. We introduce a method for mucociliary clearance measurements called 'Radio-Bolus-Scintigraphy'. A small volume of radiolabelled aerosol particles sandwiched in clean air (aerosol bolus) is inhaled near the end of a tidal breath which leads to a preferential deposition of the particles in the airways. Particles were Fe3O4 labelled with 99mTc with an aerodynamic particle diameter of 3.5 microns (monodisperse). The retention of the particles within the lungs was detected by Gamma Camera and Human Scintillation Counter. 26 healthy subjects volunteered in this study (14 nonsmokers and 12 smokers). The half width of the mucociliary clearance was found to be 2.4 h in nonsmokers and 3.3 h in smokers (p < 0.05). Intersubject variability was small, 24 hours after inhalation 55% (+/- 6%) of the inhaled particles were still found in the airways of the subjects. No difference was found between nonsmokers and smokers. Good intersubject reproducibility makes this method useful in therapy control as well as in early diagnosis of changes in mucociliary clearance kinetics and efficiency.",,G Scheuch;M Kohlhäufl;K Sommerer;H Lichte;W Hess;H Schulz;K Häussinger;J Heyder

The reserves of improving hospital care to patients with tuberculosis is to increase tuberculosis bed turnover, by efficiently distributing the flows of patients, reducing the time of their studies, and performing a complex adequate course of therapy. The ideology of 24-hour hospital care to patients with tuberculosis needs to be corrected, by following the following priorities: to provide with antituberculous drugs in compliance with real needs and depending on the epidemic situation and to perform a complete course of controlled chemotherapy in the patients; to strengthen the material-and-technical basis of tuberculosis care facilities for the creation conditions for medical personnel's safe work and for the reduction of the incidence of occupational morbidity and to enhance the efficiency of a therapeutic-and-diagnostic process; to organize and to perform up-to-date surgical treatment in order to decrease a contingent of patients with chronic forms of tuberculosis.",,G V Tret'iakov

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8697860/,Pulmonary section development influences general medical house officer interests and ABIM certifying examination performance,"To determine whether sectional development in pulmonary and critical care medicine influences medical house officers' (HO) interests and knowledge about respiratory medicine, we reviewed HO performance on the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) certifying examination during 4 years before and 5 years after reorganization of our section. After major changes in the program and introduction of new educational opportunities, HOs more often selected pulmonary consultation electives (68.6% vs 47.8%; p = 0.009) and entered pulmonary fellowships after completion of residency training (12% vs 3%; p = 0.047). Total ABIM examination score did not change, but performance on its respiratory disease component improved from a median national percentile score of 48.5% (1986 to 1989) to 80.0% (1990 to 1994) (p = 0.0365). In relation to other specialty component scores, the rank of the respiratory disease percentile improved from the lowest specialty score to the highest. ABIM examination scores correlated with the cumulative faculty effort directed toward HO teaching (r = 0.70; p = 0.04) and the total number of clinical teachers (faculty and fellows) interacting with HOs (r = 0.73; p = 0.02). Academic development in pulmonary/critical care faculty has an important influence on medical HO interests in and knowledge of that discipline. Plans for the future structure of academic pulmonary/critical care sections must take into account this impact on the training of generalists. Although institutional priorities, resources, and shifting external forces will define how, where, and by whom respiratory medicine will be taught, an appropriate number of faculty members and sufficient commitment of their time to HO education must be preserved.",,E F Haponik;D L Bowton;R Chin Jr;N E Adair;M G Lykens;P T Alford;D A Bass

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11578790/,The application of a Dutch consensus diagnostic strategy for pulmonary embolism in clinical practice,"In The Netherlands, the 'Dutch consensus strategy' was formulated in 1993 as a diagnostic strategy for patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. Four years after its introduction, the application of this strategy was investigated. A questionnaire was sent to the hospital management and the departments of internal medicine and pulmonology of all Dutch hospitals. In total, 384 questionnaires were sent out. The response rates of the internists and pulmonologists were 63 and 65%, respectively. The specialists reported to have followed the consensus strategy in 75% of the patients seen the month prior to the questionnaire. However, analysis of only the last patient with the suspicion of pulmonary embolism revealed that the consensus strategy was followed in 55 of the 162 patients. As well, an overuse and an underuse of the different diagnostic facilities was documented. Furthermore almost a quarter of the patients were treated without an ascertained diagnosis, whereas 11% were not treated despite an improper exclusion of venous thrombo-embolism. Compared to a survey in 1994, the use of the 'Dutch consensus strategy' has not improved dramatically. In 34% of the patients, the consensus strategy was strictly followed (i.e. without any additional investigation); however in 67% of the patients a proper diagnosis was achieved. In any diagnostic strategy, two aspects should be considered. First the availability of the different facilities. Second the acceptance of the strategy by the physicians, involved in the diagnosis of patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism.",,P J Hagen;M J van Strijen;G J Kieft;Y P Graafsma;M H Prins;P E Postmus

Williams,"In the 18th century, some medical practitioners considered the main pathological feature of asthma to be the production of mucus. Later, during the 19th century, airway smooth muscle contraction was recognized to be a possible cause of airflow obstruction. However, not until 1840 was the contractility of airway smooth muscle clearly established by Charles J.B. Williams, a famous London physician. In a number of innovative experiments in dogs, rabbits, livestock and even donkeys, he showed: 1) that airways contract in response to electrical stimulation; 2) that the observed contractions are almost totally abolished by belladonna and stramonium (anticholinergics); 3) that the responses faded over time; and 4) that morphine inhibited the observed responses. Application of irritant fluids into the tracheal lumen produced similar responses. These interesting observations made by Williams will be reviewed, and related to current theories concerning modulation of airway smooth muscle responsiveness.",,J Lötvall

In 1997, the organization committee of the French congress of pneumology decided to analyze the different methodologies used to assess the congress CME courses. The analysis was based on a satisfaction questionnaire, a before-after assessment of 4 workshops, and a comparison between participants and non-participants in 3 plenary sessions. Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon non-parametric tests were used for statistical analysis. Satisfaction scores were high. For the plenary sessions, test results were better for participants than for the non-participant controls and for the workshops, test results were higher after completion. This type of study can only evaluate the level of knowledge acquired and is subject to a selection bias. It cannot analyze the practical impact of the courses nor their effect on patient health. Such assessment methodologies should be used more widely in order to improve future training sessions.",,A Vergnenègre;J P Grignet

The data support a significant deficiency of adult respirologists in Canada, which is estimated to be from 10%, based on a 10-year-old outdated RCPSC recommendation, to 20%, based on equalization with the 'best' province, to as high as 50%, based on long waiting lists, particularly for respiratory sleep problems, and estimates obtained from academic centres across Canada. Although there are less data available for pediatric respirology, a similar approach suggests a 50% to 100% shortfall in pediatric respirologists. Output from Canadian training programs in adult and pediatric respirology is not likely to meet this need. We recommend that steps be taken urgently to provide sufficient resources for training adult and pediatric respirologists, and to ensure that funding is provided for subspecialist positions in the community.",,D W Cockcroft;D Wensley

He finished high school in Belgrade in 1944, graduated from Medical school, University of Belgrade in 1951, and completed his internal medicine residency in 1957. In 1960 he fulfilled the requirements for the teaching position at the University with a thesis ""The use of dilution methods in the study of circulation"" and defended his PhD thesis ""Hemodynamic characteristics of pulmonary hypertension with increased precapillary resistance"" in 1964 at the School of Medicine, University of Belgrade. Dusan Kentera was awarded Swedish government's scholarship in 1958 and spent a year in the laboratory of Gustav Nylin in Stockholm. As a fellow of the National Institutes of Health, he spent 15 months at the Institute of Physiology at The Medical College of Georgia in Augusta, USA, in the Laboratory of William F. Hamilton in 1962 and 1963. As a ""visiting scientist"" he spent three months in Memorial Research Center, University of Tennessee, in Knoxville, USA, in 1972. In 1980 and again in 1988 Dusan Kentera gave a series of lectures at leading medical research institutions in USA, including Medical School, University of Colorado in Denver, Tulane University Medical School in New Orleans, University of Tennessee Medical School in Memphis, and Texas Research and Rehabilitation Institute in Houston. He spent his career in research at the Institute for Medical Research in Belgrade, where he was appointed Research Fellow in 1952 and became Professor of Research in 1976. Simultaneously, he held teaching position at the Institute of Physiology, School of Dentistry, University of Belgrade, where he was appointed first Instructor in 1952 and full Professor in 1977. In 1964, Dusan Kentera founded the Laboratory for Hemodynamics at the Institute for Medical Research, which he headed until retirement in 1991. He was Assistant Director of the Institute for Medical Research from 1974 until 1978 and Director from 1978 until 1991. He was very much involved in postgraduate teaching at the Medical School, University of Belgrade, where he lectured at the courses in Pulmonary Diseases and Cardiology until death. Numerous Master and PhD theses were completed under his mentorship and in his Laboratory. Many of his students hold at present leading positions in academic institutions worldwide. As a researcher, Dusan Kentera has an outstanding record. He published 120 papers in peer-reviewed journals and authored chapters in several books. Main research interest of Dusan Kentera was related to cardiovascular pathophysiology, particularly in the fields of regulation of pulmonary circulation and pathogenesis of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, control mechanisms in systemic circulation and pathogenesis of arterial hypertension, contractility of skeletal muscles and myocardium, and control mechanisms in regional circulation. Most impressive, by significance and extent, is his work on the regulation of pulmonary circulation and particularly on the pathogenesis of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. Most of the research on hypoxic pulmonary hypertension was done on experimental model that he established. As opposed to all other models, which employed hypobaric hypoxia with consequent hypocapnia, in his model experimental animals were exposed to normobaric hypoxia and controlled level of carbon dioxide, thus most closely simulating hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in humans. Using this model, he examined the role of numerous factors in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. His pioneering work in this field is well incorporated into today's understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying hypoxic pulmonary hypertension as well as in therapeutic approaches to this disorder Dusan Kentera was always recognized as an outstanding figure in scientific community, yet awards and formal acknowledgments somehow by-passed him. He did share though the October Award of the City of Belgrade for research with his long time friend Dr. Vladislav Varagić in 1976. Dusan Kentera died on his birthday, April 2nd 1999. As an inspired teacher, outstanding scientist, authoritative leader and, above all, as wonderful human being, he set high standards for coming generations.
