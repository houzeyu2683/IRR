https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31754953/,The reality of general surgery training and increased complexity of abdominal wall hernia surgery,"Introduction: The Accreditation and Certification of Hernia Centers and Surgeons (ACCESS) Group of the European Hernia Society (EHS) recognizes that there is a growing need to train specialist abdominal wall surgeons. The most important and relevant argument for this proposal and statement is the growing acceptance of the increasing complexity of abdominal wall surgery due to newer techniques, more challenging cases and the required 'tailored' approach to such surgery. There is now also an increasing public awareness with social media, whereby optimal treatment results are demanded by patients. However, to date the complexity of abdominal wall surgery has not been properly or adequately defined in the current literature.",Complex hernias; Incisional hernia; Inguinal hernia; Learning curve; Surgical training; Tailored approach.,F Köckerling;A J Sheen;F Berrevoet;G Campanelli;D Cuccurullo;R Fortelny;H Friis-Andersen;J F Gillion;J Gorjanc;D Kopelman;M Lopez-Cano;S Morales-Conde;J Österberg;W Reinpold;R K J Simmermacher;M Smietanski;D Weyhe;M P Simons

Classically, it entails personnel from high-income countries going to low- and middle-income countries and engaging in educational activities as well as procedures. Academic medical personnel have included students, residents, and attendings. The pervasive notion is that this is a win-win situation for the volunteers and the hosts, that is, a pathway to bilateral academic success.

The importance and growing demand for EGS has resulted in the implementation of the General Surgeons Australia's 12-point plan for emergency surgery. Since its release, the 12-point plan has been used as a benchmark of a well-functioning ASU, both locally and abroad. This study aims to provide a descriptive review on the relevance of the 12-point plan to the ASU model and review the current evidence to support this framework. The review concludes that the establishment of the ASU model has met the aims set out by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons for EGS.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17972562/,Should the trauma surgeon do the emergency surgery?,"The specialty of trauma surgery is evolving. The continued decline in general surgery operative interventions in trauma patients has led to an exodus of promising young surgeons away from the field. A concurrent decline in the number of burn surgeons, as well as orthopedists and neurosurgeons interested in providing emergency care, led to a pressing need for surgeons able to perform emergency surgical care. In addition, the general surgery workforce has followed a trend of increased specialization, with young surgeons gravitating toward specialties that are perceived to have a more forgiving lifestyle. This development has led to troublesome gaps in the emergency surgery call schedule at many institutions. Several intrepid centers already have begun assimilating acute care surgery into their departments with impressive results for their patients. Increased operative volume, increased reimbursements, and a palatable lifestyle add to the allure of treating these complex and interesting patients. Training future surgeons to staff the ranks of acute care surgery is an important and exciting challenge. It may be that ""Should the trauma surgeon do the emergency surgery?"" is the wrong question. A better question may be ""How best can we train surgeons for this new specialty""?",,Frederick W Endorf;Gregory J Jurkovich

This approach has the potential to transform the surgical treatment for diseases including trauma, cancer, and congenital malformations. A fundamental knowledge of key concepts in regenerative medicine is imperative for surgeons to maintain a leading role in developing and implementing these technologies.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15231856/,"Robotic surgery and cancer: the present state, problems and future vision","In the 1990s, laparoscopic surgery entirely changed the traditional style of surgical operations. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has spread rapidly and is now established as the standard treatment. However, besides cholecystectomy, endoscopic procedures are still not applied so widely to a variety of surgical operations. This is because laparoscopic techniques, such as suturing or ligation, make it difficult for surgeons to perform other kinds of operations and thus greatly increase their mental and physical stress. It is necessary to introduce various advanced technologies such as: surgical robots, three dimensional (3D) images, computer graphics (CG), computer simulation technology and others. Surgical robots, including the AESOP, da Vinci and ZEUS systems, provide surgeons with technologically advanced vision and hand skills. As a result, such systems are expected to revolutionize the field of surgery. However, there have so far been few studies which discuss the indications of robotic surgery for tumors/cancer. Therefore, herein we review various studies published in English to focus on the application of robotic surgery to tumors/cancer. We point out that there are several problems to be solved for robot surgery: i) price of surgical robots, ii) training systems for surgeon, iii) coverage by medical insurance, iv) downsizing and v) navigation system. In conclusion, we believe that, in the near future as robotic technology continues to develop, almost all kinds of endoscopic surgery will be performed by this technology. It will replace traditional surgery not only in the treatment of benign diseases but also in malignant illnesses.",,Makoto Hashizume;Kouji Tsugawa

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19131286/,Applying a managerial approach to day surgery,"The present article explores the day surgery topic assuming a managerial perspective. If we assume such a perspective, day surgery can be considered as a business model decision care and not just a surgical procedure alternative to the traditional ones requiring patient hospitalization. In this article we highlight the main steps required to develop a strategic approach [Cotta Ramusino E, Onetti A. Strategia d'Impresa. Milano; Il Sole 24 Ore; Second Edition, 2007] at hospital level (Onetti A, Greulich A. Strategic management in hospitals: the balanced scorecard approach. Milano: Giuffé; 2003) and to make day surgery part of it. It means understanding: - how and when day surgery can improve the health care providers' overall performance both in terms of clinical effectiveness and financial results, and, - how to organize and integrate it with the other hospital activities in order to make it work. Approaching day surgery as a business model decision requires to address in advance a list of potential issues and necessitates of continued audit to verify the results. If it does happen, day surgery can be both safe and cost effective and impact positively on surgical patient satisfaction. We propose a sort of ""check-up list"" useful to hospital managers and doctors that are evaluating the option of introducing day surgery or are trying to optimize it.",,Alberto Onetti

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21487849/,Quality of care in humanitarian surgery,"Humanitarian surgical programs are set up de novo, within days or hours in emergency or disaster settings. In such circumstances, insuring quality of care is extremely challenging. Basic structural inputs such as a safe structure, electricity, clean water, a blood bank, sterilization equipment, a post-anesthesia recovery unit, appropriate medications should be established. Currently, no specific credentials are needed for surgeons to operate in a humanitarian setting; the training of more humanitarian surgeons is desperately needed. Standard perioperative protocols for the humanitarian setting after common procedures such as Cesarean section, burn care, open fractures, and amputations and antibiotic prophylaxis, and post-operative pain management must be developed. Outcome data, especially long-term outcomes, are difficult to collect as patients often do not return for follow-up and may be difficult to trace; standard databases for post-operative infections and mortality rates should be established. Checklists have recently received significant attention as an instrument to support the improvement of surgical quality; knowing which items are most applicable to humanitarian settings remains unknown. In conclusion, the quality of surgical services in humanitarian settings must be regulated. Many other core medical activities of humanitarian organizations such as therapeutic feeding, mass vaccination, and the treatment of infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus, are subject to rigorous reporting of quality indicators. There is no reason why surgery should be exempted from quality oversight.

During telerobotic operations, the surgeon sits at a computer console. The computer translates the motions of the surgeon's hands into motions of the robotic instruments. Introduction of telerobotics into clinical practice raises issues comparable to those generated by the rapid introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the late 1980s. As a result, we have instituted processes in our hospitals for the granting of clinical privileges for telerobotic surgery. These processes are derived from the guidelines of the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons for granting clinical privileges for laparoscopic general surgery. Our hospitals require the following: (1) board certification or board eligibility for the appropriate surgical board; (2) clinical privileges for the open and laparoscopic operations that will be performed telerobotically; (3) satisfactory completion of the Food and Drug Administration-mandated training course in the safe use of the robotic surgical system; (4) performance of telerobotic operations in animate models; (5) observation of clinical cases of telerobotic surgery by an expert surgeon; (6) acting as bedside assistant surgeon in telerobotic operations or supervision by a preceptor during the surgeon's initial operations; (7) observation by a proctor of the surgeon's initial clinical telerobotic operations; and (8) ongoing monitoring of surgical outcomes of telerobotic operations.

Following evidence-based evaluation, if a new modality is found ready for adoption in practice, surgeons need education in the safe and effective use of the new modality. The educational experience should include structured teaching and learning, verification of new knowledge and skills, preceptoring or proctoring, and monitoring of outcomes. Credentialing and privileging to perform a new procedure or use an emerging technology should be based on evaluation of knowledge and skills and outcomes of surgical care, and not merely on the numbers of procedures performed. Education of the entire surgical team is also essential. The entire process involving education, verification of knowledge and skills, credentialing, and privileging must be transparent.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16136283/,"Relationships between volume, efficiency, and quality in surgery--a delicate balance from managerial perspectives","Volume, efficiency, and quality in hospital care are often mixed in debate. We analyze how these dimensions are interrelated in surgical hospital management, with particular focus on volume effects: under financial constraints, efficiency is the best form of cost control. External perception of quality is important to attract patients and gain volumes. There are numerous explicit and implicit notions of surgical quality. The relevance of implicit criteria (functionality, reliability, consistency, customaziability, convenience) can change in the time course of hospital competition. Outcome data theoretically are optimal measures of quality, but surgical quality is multifactorially influenced by case mix, surgical technique, indication, process designs, organizational structures, and volume. As quality of surgery is hard to grade, implicit criteria such as customizability currently often overrule functionality (outcome) as the dominant market driver. Activities and volumes are inputs to produce quality. Capability does not translate to ability in a linear function. Adequate process design is important to realize efficiency and quality. Volumes of activities, degree of standardization, specialization, and customer involvement are relevant estimates for process design in services. Flow-orientated management focuses primarily on resource utilization and efficiency, not on surgical quality. The relationship between volume and outcome in surgery is imperfectly understood. Factors involve learning effects both on process efficiency and quality, increased standardization and task specialization, process flow homogeneity, and potential for process integration. Volume is a structural component to develop efficiency and quality. The specific capabilities and process characteristics that contribute to surgical outcome improvement should be defined and exported. Adequate focus should allow even small institutions to benefit from volume-associated effects. All volumes-based learning within standardized processes will finally lead to a plateauing of quality. Only innovations will then further improve quality. Possessing volume can set the optimal ground for continuous process research, subsequent change, innovation, and optimization, while volume itself appears not to be a quality prerequisite.",,Thomas W Kraus;Markus W Büchler;Christian Herfarth

Both absolute and relative models of expertise have been developed, and each allows a richer understanding of the application of these concepts to emerge. Trainees must develop both independent and interdependent expertise, and an appreciation of the essentially constructivist and uncertain nature of medical knowledge. Approach may be more important than innate talent; the concepts of 'flow', sustained 'deliberate practice' and 'adaptive expertise' are examples of expert approaches to learning. Non-analytical reasoning plays a key role in decision making at expert levels of practice.

The results of an inquiry together with information about training in pediatric surgery in 24 countries are summarised to show the different possibilities of organising training in pediatric surgery inside and outside Europe. The number of trainees in pediatric surgery (ranging from 0 to 339 trainees per country), the density of pediatric surgeons (ranging from 424 to 35 714 live births/year per pediatric surgeon) and the number of Centres of Pediatric Surgery (ranging from 4167 to 65,000 live births or 450,000 to 5,300,000 inhabitants per Centre) varies a lot in the different countries. Countries with a higher density of pediatric surgeons often also have a higher number of trainees irrespective of the birth rate and the number of inhabitants within the country, indicating a good infrastructure for pediatric surgery. In 87.5 % of the countries pediatric surgery is recognised as a specialty. The mean duration of training is about 6 years and 3 months, excluding the countries where it is necessary to become a fully accredited general surgeon before doing pediatric surgery. The mean duration of stay in general surgery is 2 years and 10 months. In one third of the countries it is obligatory to spend some time (3 to 12 months) in pediatrics. An elective or a compulsory period of time (1 - 6 months) in other specialties such as orthopedic surgery, plastic and reconstructive surgery, thoracic surgery and urology exists in 41.7 % of the nations. The most common subspecialties within pediatric surgery practised during the training by the resident are abdominal surgery, thoracic surgery, oncological surgery, head and neck surgery and urology. Possible means of control to guarantee a high quality of training include a defined time of stay in each subspecialty, the number of operations done by the trainee or the number of cases treated by the resident in the respective subspecialty and the distinction of different levels of surgery done by the trainee during his residence.

Therefore students can more intensively focus on their preferences in the practical year. In the present article we describe the provided surgical training sites, the organisation of the practical year, the surgical training itself and the quality management. We provide answers to the following questions: does dividing the practical year into quarters have a (negative) influence on the grades of final exams; how interested, motivated and satisfied are students in the different (surgical) quarters of the practical year and in which quarter(s) can new generation staff be recruited? Methods: We used results of the final exams of three cohorts of the traditional Mannheim track and three cohorts of MaReCuM, as well as the results of the Mannheim Questionnaire of Satisfaction with Training Conditions in the Practical Year of Medical Education from the regular evaluation of three practical year cohorts within two years. Conclusions: Dividing the practical year into quarters is possible and can be organised together with the new ""mandatory subject"" ambulatory medicine. The introduction of quarters has no negative effects on the results of final exams. The assignment in the surgical field from students' perspectives with regard to motivation, interest, knowledge and satisfaction with training is comparable to surgical electives.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19074862/,Biological research in the evolution of cancer surgery: a personal perspective,"During the 19th, and for most of the 20th century, malignant tumors were removed by mutilating radical anatomic dissection. Advances such as anesthesia, asepsis, and blood transfusion made possible increasingly more radical operations. There was no scientific rationale for the operations being performed. Surgery in the 20th century was dominated by the principles of William S. Halsted, who contended that the bloodstream was of little significance as a route of tumor cell dissemination; a tumor was autonomous of its host; and cancer was a local-regional disease that spread in an orderly fashion based on mechanical considerations. Halsted believed that both the extent and nuances of an operation influenced patient outcome and that inadequate surgical skill was responsible for the failure to cure. A new surgical era arose in 1957, when cancer surgery began to be influenced by laboratory and clinical research, with results contrary to Halstedian principles. A new hypothesis resulted in a scientific basis for cancer surgery. Clinical trials supported the thesis that operable cancer is a systemic disease and that variations in local-regional therapy are unlikely to substantially affect survival. Complex host-tumor relationships were shown to affect every aspect of cancer and, contrary to Halsted's thesis, the bloodstream is of considerable importance in tumor dissemination. Clinical trials also have shown that less radical surgery is justified. Studies have shown that improved survival can be achieved with systemic therapy after surgery. Such therapy can reduce both the incidence of distant disease and the tumor recurrence at the tumor site after minimal surgery. The use of systemic therapy in patients who have no identifiable metastatic disease is a drastic departure from previous strategies. New technological innovations resulting from engineering research have improved the quality of life of patients by eliminating the need for some surgical procedures. Because cancer is apt to be a systemic disease, however, clinical trials are necessary to determine the effect of these modalities on patient outcome. Although technological developments will continue to play a role in cancer therapy, research in molecular biology and genetics will dictate the future status of cancer treatment and, ultimately, the future of surgery.",,Bernard Fisher

There is much debate over the usefulness and cost-effectiveness of these systems. The currently available robotic surgical technology is described. Published data relating to the da Vinci system are reviewed and the current status of surgical robotics within Australia and New Zealand is assessed. The first da Vinci system in Australia and New Zealand was installed in 2003. Four systems had been installed by 2006 and seven systems are currently in use. Most of these are based in private hospitals. Technical advantages of this system include 3-D vision, enhanced dexterity and improved ergonomics when compared with standard laparoscopic surgery. Most procedures currently carried out are urological, with cardiac, gynaecological and general surgeons also using this system. The number of patients undergoing robotic-assisted surgery in Australia and New Zealand has increased fivefold in the past 4 years. The most common procedure carried out is robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Published data suggest that robotic-assisted surgery is feasible and safe although the installation and recurring costs remain high. There is increasing acceptance of robotic-assisted surgery, especially for urological procedures. The da Vinci surgical system is becoming more widely available in Australia and New Zealand. Other surgical specialties will probably use this technology.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10832521/,"[At the beginning of the third millennium: what kind of surgery, what kind of surgeon?]","Technological progress and the evolution of biological knowledge lead us to expect major developments in the fields of organ replacement, minimally invasive surgery and tumour therapy in the coming decades. It is widely believed that xenotransplantation may offer a possible solution to the problem of the current chronic shortage of donors, though their use at present encounters formidable immunological obstacles, particularly as regards discordant transplants. Genetic engineering and the realisation of transgenic donors as well as new strategies aimed at modifying the immune status of the donor may well be the key to new developments in this sector. Selective culturing of tissues and the production of totally implantable artificial organs are additional lines of research which may provide useful means of meeting the increasing demand for organs. The enormous advances made in the field of high-tech solutions applied to the biomedical disciplines are destined to open up new frontiers in diagnostics, operating technique and the permanent training of surgeons. In particular, we are about to witness an extension of the use of computer technology and robotics, embracing the simulation and reproduction of virtual reality, telemedicine (teleconsulting and telesurgery) and the creation of experimental models. Minimally invasive surgery will unquestionably benefit from this progress with the possibility of extending its range of indications to procedures in which human limitations are more evident owing to difficulties of access and the size of the target, at the same time guaranteeing high-precision manoeuvres. In the oncological field, high expectations accompany the advances in our knowledge of molecular biology with the genetic mapping of tumours which may pave the way for screening programs and gene therapy. Alongside the scientific and technological development of the surgery of the future, we can expect to see the increasing emergence of: a) economic problems related to the progressive increase in healthcare costs, amongst other things as a result of the powerful impact of high-tech solutions; b) social problems in terms of the inevitable conflict between cost-containment policies and the right to healthcare; c) moral and bioethical problems relating to the possible establishment of genetic registries and to the different patient-care provider relationship which is likely to come about as the result of the interference of machines or robots.

According to some authors, sepsis in surgical patients is different from those in non-surgical patients because of the immune function modulation that occurs as a result of surgery and anesthesia applied; therefore, these two groups should be monitored separately. In the treatment of sepsis, the key steps are early recognition of sepsis, rapid diagnosis, and aggressive treatment that includes the choice of intervention with the least physiological insult to control the sources of infection.

Our aims were to evaluate the current situation concerning medical liability in general surgery (GS) in Portugal, the reasons for claims, and the forensic evaluations and conclusions, as well as the association between these issues and the judicial outcomes. We analysed the Medico-Legal Council (CML) reports of the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences of Portugal related to GS during 2001-2010. The judicial outcomes of each case were requested from the Public Prosecutor Office (PPO) and the court. Alleged cases of medical liability in GS represented 11.2% of the total cases analysed by the CML. We estimated that in Portugal, 4:100,000 surgeries are subject to litigation. The majority of complaints were due to the patient's death (75.4%), with laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgeries representing 55.2% of cases. In 76.1% of the cases, the CML believed that there was no violation of legesartis and in 55.2% of cases, no causal nexus was found between the medical practice and the alleged harm. The PPO prosecuted physicians in 6.4% of the cases and resulted in one conviction.

The researches have been developed in cooperation between Telerobotics Laboratory, Department of Mechanics, Politecnico di Milano, Italy, and Automation and Control Section, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, USA. The researches carried to a telesurgery robotic operation on a dummy on 7th July 1993, by means of satellites communications, to a prostatic biopsy on a human patient on 1st September 1995 with optical fibers, to results on time delay effects, to results on virtual reality applications for training on laparoscopy and surgery. The search implied time delay when the control input originated in Politecnico di Milano, Italy. The results were satisfactory, but also pointed out the need for specific new control transformations to ease the operator's or surgeon's visual/mental workload for hand-eye coordination. In the same research, dummy force commands from JPL to Milan were sent, and were echoed immediately back to JPL, measuring the round-trip time of the command signal. This, to some degree, simulates a contact force feedback situation. The results were very surprising; despite the fact that the ISDN calls are closed and ""private"" calls, the round-trip time exhibited great variations not only between calls but also within the same call. The results proved that telerobotics and telecontrol may be applied to surgery. Time latency variations are caused by features of communication network, of sending and receiving end computer software.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8312776/,Minimally invasive surgery. Future developments,"The rapid development of minimally invasive surgery means that there will be fundamental changes in interventional treatment. Technological advances will allow new minimally invasive procedures to be developed. Application of robotics will allow some procedures to be done automatically, and coupling of slave robotic instruments with virtual reality images will allow surgeons to perform operations by remote control. Miniature motors and instruments designed by microengineering could be introduced into body cavities to perform operations that are currently impossible. New materials will allow changes in instrument construction, such as use of memory metals to make heat activated scissors or forceps. With the reduced trauma associated with minimally invasive surgery, fewer operations will require long hospital stays. Traditional surgical wards will become largely redundant, and hospitals will need to cope with increased through-put of patients. Operating theatres will have to be equipped with complex high technology equipment, and hospital staff will need to be trained to manage it. Conventional nursing care will be carried out more in the community. Many traditional specialties will be merged, and surgical training will need fundamental revision to ensure that surgeons are competent to carry out the new procedures.",,J E Wickham

This study analyzed resident-reported gastric procedure experience by chief residents from U.S. programs. The Resident Statistic Summaries (Report C) for 1990-2001 were compiled and analyzed. Results are expressed as the average number of operations performed per resident, standard deviation (SD), and the percentage (%) of total gastric operative cases. For all gastric-related surgery, the average reported cases per chief resident ranged from 9.8-12.4 with a peak in 1990 and a nadir in 1999; in 2001 the reported case average was 11.3 (SD ranged from 6-8). Over the same interval, vagotomy decreased from 24% in 1990 to 7% in 2001, whereas gastric-reduction operations increased from 5%-34%. Total gastrectomy remained a constant less than 1.0 per chief resident (range 0.6-0.8), whereas partial gastric resection (PGR) was unchanged.

We recommend MTL30 (mortality, transfer, length of stay) as one of these markers to consistently measure the quality of large visceral surgical interventions. The MTL30 subsumes a number of known markers that may help to predict postoperative complications. The MTL30 is considered to be fulfilled when a patient on the 30th day following surgery, a) has died b) is still in the hospital or c) has been transferred to another acute care hospital. The evaluation of the StuDoQ register of the German Society for General and Visceral Surgery (DGAV) shows that MTL30 occurs significantly more often than any of the individual parameters.

In this work, the position and motion of surgical instruments are analyzed through an objective process, denoted C-PASS, to measure surgeon performance of laparoscopic, endoscopic, and image-guided procedures. To develop C-PASS, clinically relevant performance characteristics were identified. Then measurement techniques for parameters that represented each characteristic were derived, and analytic techniques were implemented to transform these parameters into explicit, robust metrics. The metrics comprise the C-PASS performance assessment method, which has been validated over the last 3 years in studies of laparoscopy and endoscopy. These studies show that C-PASS is straightforward, reproducible, and accurate. It is sufficiently powerful to assess the efficiency of these complex processes. It is likely that C-PASS and similar approaches will improve skills acquisition and learning and also enable the objective comparison of systems and techniques.",,Nicholas Stylopoulos;Kirby G Vosburgh

There are now demands for the adoption of more transparent and effective processes for risk management. Reviews of surgical practice have highlighted the presence of unacceptable levels of avoidable adverse events. This is being resolved in two ways. First, attention is being directed to the extent that training and experience have on outcomes after surgery, and both appear to be important. Second, a greater appreciation of human factors engineering has promoted a greater involvement of surgeons in processes involving teamwork and non-technical skills. The community wants surgeons who are competent and health-care systems that minimize risk.

Annual national resident case log data from Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) website and case logs of graduating Easton Hospital residents (years 2002-2009) were used for analysis. Weighted average change in total number of cases in our institution was -1.20 (P = 0.52) vs 1.78 (P = 0.07) for the national program average with statistically significant difference on comparison (P = 0.027). We also found significant difference in case volume changes at the national level compared with our institution for the following ACGME defined subcategories: alimentary tract [8.19 (P < 0.01) vs -1.08 (P = 0.54)], abdomen [8.48 (P < 0.01) vs -6.29 (P < 0.01)], breast [1.91 (P = 0.89) vs -3.6 (P = 0.02)], and vascular [4.03 (P = 0.02) vs -3.98 (P = 0.01)]. Comparing the national trend to the community hospital we see that there is total increase in cases at the national level whereas there is a decrease in case volume at the community hospital. These trends can also be followed in ACGME defined subcategories which form the major case load for a general surgical training such as alimentary tract, abdominal, breast, and vascular procedures.

Disclosure benefits patients, providers, and healthcare institutions. However, the act of disclosure can be difficult for physicians. Surgeons struggle with disclosure in unique ways compared with other specialties, and disclosure in the surgical setting has specific challenges. The frequency of surgical adverse events along with a dysfunctional tort system, the team structure of surgical staff, and obstacles created inadvertently by existing surgical patient safety initiatives may contribute to an environment not conducive to disclosure. Fortunately, there are multiple strategies to address these barriers. Participation in communication and resolution programs, integration of Just Culture principles, surgical team disclosure planning, refinement of informed consent and morbidity and mortality processes, surgery-specific professional standards, and understanding the complexities of disclosing other clinicians' errors all have the potential to help surgeons provide patients with complete, satisfactory disclosures. Improvement in the regularity and quality of disclosures after surgical adverse events and errors will be key as the field of patient safety continues to advance.",,Lauren E Lipira;Thomas H Gallagher

The VA National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) is a validated, outcome-based program that prospectively collects clinical data on all major surgical operations in the VA, and builds validated risk-adjustment models that generate, for each hospital and each surgical specialty within a hospital, risk-adjusted outcomes expressed as O/E (observed to expected) ratios for 30-day mortality and morbidity. The O/E ratio has been validated as a reliable comparative measure of the quality of surgical care. Unlike retrospective studies that are based on administrative databases, NSQIP studies have failed to demonstrate a direct relationship between volume and risk-adjusted outcomes of surgery across various specialties. These studies have emphasized that the quality of systems of care was more important than volume in determining the overall quality of surgical care at an institution. High-volume hospitals could still deliver poor care in as much as low-volume hospitals could deliver good care. NSQIP studies have also underscored the major limitations of claims data and administrative databases in the provision of adequate risk-adjustment models that are crucial for volume-outcome studies. Therefore, volume should not be substituted for prospectively monitored and properly risk-adjusted outcomes as a comparative measure of the quality of surgical care.",,Shukri F Khuri;William G Henderson

Although we know that apprenticeships are effective in medical workplaces, its precise mechanisms remain tacit and implicit. However, decreasing exposure to relevant learning experiences forces us to develop an understanding of teaching and learning in apprenticeships. Central to the learning in apprenticeships are entrustment of autonomy and supply of expertise by the supervisors. Supervisors perform risk-assessments to estimate how much autonomy can be entrusted to their residents continuously. Such assessments are particular challenging to supervisors when the margins for error are narrow, for instance during complex tasks of surgical procedures. In this perspective we present our insights regarding the teaching and learning during surgical procedures.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14614630/,Conservative management of splenic trauma: history and current trends,"Evolution of the present-day policy of conservative management of ruptured spleen has been hailed as one of the most notable advances in pediatric surgery. Until 1971, routine splenectomy used to be the sacrosanct treatment for splenic trauma. It was universally believed that non-operative management carried a high mortality of 90 to 100%. Sporadic reports of successful conservative treatment appeared in the early twentieth century, but regrettably, these were ignored. Likewise, experimental studies pointing to the danger of post-splenectomy sepsis were also disregarded. Dominant surgical opinion continued to practice removal of the injured spleen. In 1968, Upadhyaya and Simpson, based on a well-designed clinical analysis of 52 children made a convincing plea for conservative management. In 1971, Upadhyaya et al. presented results of a corroborative experimental study, which provided the conclusive evidence that isolated splenic tears are well tolerated and heal spontaneously by first intention. Seeing the surge of publications that followed this presentation, it becomes apparent that this study constituted the real turning point that changed the world opinion in favour of salvage of the ruptured spleen. By 1979, numerous authors had reported the safety of non-operative management in hundreds of children all over the world. Currently, the policy of routine splenectomy has been universally abandoned; and the reported salvage rate of ruptured spleen is more than 90%. This paper traces the historical perspectives in the management of injured spleen from the times of Aristotle to the present day.",,P Upadhyaya

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17120945/,The volume-outcome debate revisited,"Multiple studies support the intuitive association between higher provider procedure volume and better clinical outcomes. Health care purchasers and payers have been seeking ways to direct patients to high-volume providers to improve the quality of care received and to avoid costs associated with higher surgical morbidity. Volume-based referral has faced resistance from providers who are concerned that the use of volume instead of more direct measures of surgical quality will result in unfair discrimination. On close examination, volume-based referral policies also appear to be more congruent with payers' interests than the interests of individual patients and providers. Furthermore, a policy of volume-based referral does not address surgical quality directly, is applicable to only a very small segment of surgical care, and is logistically problematic. However, in the absence of viable alternative measures of surgical quality, imperfect proxies such as volume will likely continue to be a significant part of the national dialogue surrounding surgical quality.",,Samuel R G Finlayson
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29239595/,Explaining the absence of surgical procedure regulation,"Each year in the United States, surgeons perform approximately 64 million surgical procedures, ranging from tooth extraction to open heart surgery. Yet, notwithstanding the frequency of surgical procedures and their often critical importance to patient health, no state or federal agency either approves the use of new surgical procedures or directly regulates existing procedures. The absence of surgical procedure regulation differs from the regulation of new pharmaceutical products, which can be introduced into interstate commerce only after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed ""adequate and well-controlled [clinical] investigations"" and concluded the data from those studies sufficiently establish the drug's safety and efficacy. Surgical procedures, by contrast, are more often conveyed from professor to student, the result being that surgical approaches may vary considerably from one geographic region to another. Whether different techniques produce different outcomes is not always clear, in part because the absence of regulation means that evidence often has not been systematically generated or may be in a form not suitable for comparison. Commentators have noted the differing treatment that persists between surgery and pharmaceuticals and have offered a number of justifications. For example, they have suggested that the surgical profession should self-regulate, that excessive regulation could deter surgeries of unproven benefit even when the surgery may be in the best interest of the patient, and that surgical trials could disrupt the doctor-patient relationship, such as by emphasizing uncertainty in a context where patient trust is important. In the context of innovative (as opposed to established) surgical procedures, controlled trials might be disfavored due to concern that desperate patients might unwisely submit themselves to risky experimental treatments undertaken by overzealous researchers. When commentators advocate for increased surgical regulation, they generally limit their calls for reform to innovative surgical procedures. The absence of direct regulation, however, has implications for the quality of evidence available to support an optimal choice from among all of the alternatives in the surgeon's armamentarium, whether innovative or standard, and whether surgical or non-surgical. This Article first examines the current framework of indirect regulation surrounding surgical procedures and then offers potential explanations as to why surgical procedures themselves are not already subject to direct federal regulation. Finally, it considers possible contributions of increased surgical regulation, including the identification of evidence gaps, the generation or collection of evidence to fill those gaps, and the impact on surgeon decision-making and patient consent.",,Jonathan J Darrow

Each suggestion is offered based on the value added to aviation, with an acknowledgment that the suggestion may be more or less applicable in surgery.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9860221/,Conceptional and structural conditions for successful clinical research,"The efficiency of surgical research has again become the subject of debate. Clinical research is required to improve our understanding of surgical disorders and our ability to treat patients. This involves both experimental research (research in the test tube) and clinical research in actual patients. The surgeon must remain the expert because it is he who deals with the patient and is confronted with his problems. On the other hand, care for the patient, must always be the central issue. Here a new orientation is needed, evaluating the effectiveness of surgical research from the patient's point of view. Surgical treatment, particularly surgical research, must be adapted first to the individual patient and only secondly to the surgical disease - the problem must determine the method, not vice versa. While it is clear that a creative atmosphere, supportive structure and efficient organisation are enormously helpful, today's exaggerated attention to matters of structure and organisation are often poor substitutes for creativity and intuition. Surgical research does not refer solely to therapy research but includes methods for carrying out controlled clinical trials, establishing guidelines and scores and designing instruments for measuring outcome. Socioeconomic and analyses and ethical considerations are crucial for facing such conflicts as ""quality versus quantity"", ""profession versus business"", ""patient care versus economics costs"". Proposals for designing more effective concepts, structure and organisation for clinical research are presented here, and three models are introduced: the cooperation model, the integration model and a mixture of the two.",,H Troidl

These applications are mediated through the computer interface and embody VR as an integral part of a paradigm shift in the field of medicine.

At the remote site there is a 3-D camera system and responsive manipulators with sensory input. At the workstation there is a 3-D monitor and dexterous handles with force feedback. The VR surgical simulator is a stylized recreation of the human abdomen with several essential organs. Using a head-mounted display and DataGlove, a person can learn anatomy from a new perspective by 'flying' inside and around the organs, or can practice surgical procedures with a scalpel and clamps. Database visualization creates 3-D images of complex medical data for new perspectives in analysis. VR applications in rehabilitation medicine permit impaired individuals to perform tasks not otherwise available to them, allow accurate assessment and therapy for their disabilities, and help architects understand their critical needs in public or personal space.

A comparison of the United States and Canada,"How models of health care financing and delivery affect patterns of procedure volumes, outcomes, and volume-outcome associations is not known. We compared volume-outcome studies done in Canada, which provides residents with universal, single-payer health care, with those done in the United States, to determine whether there was a difference in the likelihood of finding statistically significant volume-outcome associations. We analyzed 142 articles, most (90.1%) of which were from the United States. The articles described a total of 291 separate analyses. After adjusting for the clustering of multiple analyses in the same study, the likelihood of finding a statistically significant volume-outcome association was substantially lower in Canadian studies as compared with those from the United States (odds ratio 0.24, 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.74, p = 0.01). This result persisted after adjustment for the procedure/condition studied, and the number of study subjects. Canadian volume-outcome analyses are less likely to identify statistically significant volume-outcome associations than US studies, possibly because of the smaller size of some Canadian studies. It is also possible that different models of health care financing and delivery affect patterns of procedure volumes and volume-outcome associations.

After passing a special examination, 480 of 2000 residents choose surgery and train during twelve 6-month rotations. Surgical research is organized through government agencies, individual units, or volunteer groups. In 1992, of 8268114 procedures, appendectomy represented 4.15%; hernia, 4.09%; varicose veins, 3.61%; and cholecystectomy, 1.82%. Appendectomy has decreased from 306500 per year in 1980 (34% of all gastrointestinal surgical procedures) to 159900 (15%) in 1996, whereas cholecystectomy has increased from 64700 to 95300. Emergency gastrointestinal procedures represented 15% of all surgical procedures in 1996, doubling in the last 4 years (essentially for labor and endoscopic procedures). Ambulatory procedures have increased 12-fold since 1980, essentially (75%) in private practice. About 27% of 160000 appendectomies and 77% of 95300 cholecystectomies were performed laparoscopically in 1997. One person of 4 in France has or has had cancer, mainly due to tobacco abuse. In 1993, 32000 surgical procedures were performed for gastrointestinal cancer. Of 532000 deaths (1992), about 150000 were due to cancer, 10000 to alcohol-related disease, and 22000 to trauma. Transplantation in France increased from 3180 procedures in 1993 to 2807 in 1996, essentially lungs and heart and lungs. Between 60% and 100% of health expenditures are reimbursed by the government, the remaining being covered by private insurances.

The average time of the procedures individually and reclassified within the BUPA schedule showed that both the severity of the procedure and the grade of surgeon influenced future theatre needs. For almost every type of procedure, as expected, consultants were quicker than registrars, who in turn were faster than SHOs. The hidden cost of training surgeons in general surgical operative procedures can be estimated as a result.

A laboratory analysis would be necessary. According to Leriche the syndrome could be observed also on other non-surgical trauma. Leriche's concept was ignored by the anglo-saxonic literature but a new scientific approach to the same problem came from Harvard. Walter Cannon with his concept of homeostasis and Henderson, Gamble, Peters and Van Slyke with their definition of the chemical anatomy of the organic fluids and their quantitative analysis, opened the way to Francis Moore's concept of surgery and trauma as metabolic problems. This new biological basis, and the broad enlargement of its spectrum to the whole body, gave a new scope to the surgical practice. Surgery must now be considered as an integrated process, a succession of phenomena defined as pre-operative, per-operative and post-operative representing, nevertheless, a true continuity. To its understanding the post-operative phase cannot be separated from the other phases. La maladie post-opératoire cannot be defined as an unity: there are several post-operative diseases. But the surgical patient must be considered always in the totality of his elements: the somatic or anatomical, the metabolic or physiological and the psychic, forming a complete unity.

Ligature is the term given to the length of thread or other material, which was used in the surgical process of tying off a duct or a blood vessel to stop bleeding. Cautery or cauterization was the application of a heated instrument, such as a knife, in those days to destroy tissues to stop bleeding and promote healing. Cauterization has been largely replaced by electrocoagulation, which is the use of a high-frequency electric current to seal blood vessels by heat and thus stop bleeding.",,

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17955309/,"The challenges of resident training in complex hepatic, pancreatic, and biliary procedures","Operations on the liver and pancreas have fallen within the domain of the general surgeon and have been part of general surgery training. The more complex procedures involving these organs are limited in number in most general surgery residencies and do not afford an opportunity for vast experience. Moreover, fellowship programs in hepato-bilio-pancreatic (HPB) surgery and the development of laparoscopic techniques may have further limited the familiarity of general surgery residents with these operations. To determine the experience accrued by finishing general surgery residents, we accessed, through the Residency Review Committee of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, the Resident Case Log System used by general surgery residents throughout their training to document operative cases. The number of operations on the gallbladder, bile ducts, pancreas, and liver was examined over the past 16 years (there were missing data for 3 years). Reference years 1995 and 2005 were compared to detect trends. Experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomy has steadily increased and averaged more than 100 cases in 2006. Experience in liver resection, distal pancreatectomy, and partial (Whipple) pancreatectomy has statistically improved from 1995 to 2005, but the numbers of cases are low, generally less than five per finishing resident. Experience in open common bile duct and choledocho-enteric anastomoses has statistically declined from 1995 to 2005, averaging less than four cases per finishing resident. The mode (most frequently performed number) for liver and pancreas resections was either 0 or 1. It is doubtful this experience in HPB surgery engenders confidence in many finishing residents. Attention should be focused on augmenting training in HPB surgery for general surgery residents perhaps through a combination of programmatic initiatives, ex vivo experiences, and minifellowships. Institutional initiatives might consist of defined HPB services with appropriate expertise, infrastructure, process, and outcome measures in which a resident-oriented, competency-based curriculum could be developed.",,Thomas S Helling;Anjay Khandelwal

The ASU has a day team with two registrars, two residents and a nurse practitioner. All patients are admitted and stay in the ASU until discharge or transfer to other units. Handover of the patients at the end of each day is facilitated by a comprehensive ASU database. The implementation of the ASU at Nepean Hospital has improved the timing of assessment by the surgical unit.

Although surgery is a recognised factor in local disease control, prognosis is now believed to be predetermined at the time of diagnosis by the presence of micrometastatic deposits. Modern cancer management consists of more skilled and conservative surgery to remove the primary tumour; adjuvant therapies are also given before and after the operation to target the subclinical metastatic deposits. The most important components of high-quality care in surgical oncology are: sound clinical judgment, surgical skill, and multidisciplinary care. These prerequisites are best achieved by specialisation, but high operative volume is not essential for excision of many types of tumour. Quality assurance using several readily available tools can ensure that the process of care from presentation to outcome is constantly improved and that institutional variations in number of cases and quality of care are monitored.",,Michael Douek;Irving Taylor

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19317778/,Training in the private sector: what works and how do we increase opportunities?,"In Australia 61% of elective surgery takes place in private hospitals where current opportunities for surgical education and training (SET) are limited. The situation will shortly be compounded because of the large increase in local medical graduates, many of whom will aspire to be surgeons. How and where to train these extra surgeons to meet the expanding needs of the community must be addressed. Two models of private sector training are reviewed both of which involved combined training in both private and public sectors. Two second-year (SET 2) positions were created from one public hospital SET position by using the private sector for 3.5 days per week for 3 months of a 6-month rotation. The second model was applicable to post-fellowship training with a fairly even split between public and private sector responsibilities. In the first year, four registrars shared the two 6-month rotations for the SET 2 position. Trainees did the required minimum procedures (range 109-139) with primary operating targets of 20-25% (range 21-32%). The post-fellowship position in colorectal surgery was greatly enhanced by the private sector involvement with regard to operating experience as well as meeting part of the remuneration of the trainee. Successful models for training within the private sector in Australia can be found. To expand training in the private sector there will need to be a cultural shift in the perceptions of surgeons, patients, administrators, and trainees.

Until very recently, surgeons in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world, although required to undergo formal and compulsory examinations to test their factual knowledge and decision making, were not required to demonstrate technical ability. Therefore, there existed (and still exist) no objective assessment criteria to test trainees' surgical skill, especially during the exit examination, which, if passed, provides unrestricted license to surgeons to practice their specialties. However, with the introduction of a new curriculum by various surgical societies and a demand from the lay community for better standards, new assessment tools are emerging that focus on technical competency and that could objectively and reliably measure surgical skills. Furthermore, training authorities and hospitals are keen to embrace these changes for satisfactory accreditation and reaccreditation processes and to assure the public of the safety of the public and private health care systems. In the United Kingdom, two new surgical tools (Surgical Direct Observation of Procedural Skill, and Procedure Based Assessments) have been simultaneously introduced to assess surgical trainees. The authors describe these two assessment methods, provide an overview of other assessment tools currently or previously used to assess surgical skills, critically analyze the two new assessment tools, and reflect on the merit of simultaneously introducing them.",,Muhammed Ashraf Memon;David Brigden;Manjunath S Subramanya;Breda Memon
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18224483/,Heraklas on knots: sixteen surgical nooses and knots from the first century A.D,"In the first century of our common era, the Greek physician Heraklas wrote a brief essay on how to tie 16 knots and nooses for surgical and orthopedic purposes. His work is reintroduced and discussed here because its place in the origin and evolution of surgery needs to be properly acknowledged and recorded in the current medical literature. To do so, Raeder's definitive Greek edition of the oldest extant manuscripts of Heraklas' essay was studied along with the various illustrated interpretations of his text published over the last six centuries. Moreover, the contemporary literature was searched for current applications of Heraklas' knots by use of a database of surgical knots. It was found that seven of Heraklas' 16 knots and nooses were still applied surgically of late, and that four of these have even been recently rediscovered for such applications. Therefore, it is concluded that Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine medicine had a rich knowledge and high standards. Contemporary surgical techniques may be found to be truly ancient if we search deep enough, far enough, and long enough.",,J Joris Hage

Except for a slight decline in operative experience in head and neck and gastric surgery, the experience in other primary component procedures either remained stable (major breast, esophagus, intestine, colon, pancreas, spleen and endocrine) or increased (minor breast, anorectal, hernia, biliary, vascular and trauma). A rich experience in secondary component procedures was maintained in thoracic, pediatric and plastic surgery, all of which are services within the department of surgery. A relatively low but stable experience in gynecology, neurosurgery, orthopaedics and urology has been reported, which did not change when these disciplines became separate departments. Finally, there has been a dramatic increase in endoscopic procedures performed in the surgery department despite the presence of endoscopic services in other departments. It is believed that such an institutional review of surgical resident caseload over time will be of help not only to program directors but also to accrediting and certifying organizations concerned with surgical training programs and their graduates.",,R W Barnes;M F Whiteside;J A Eisner;N P Lang;G S Campbell
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18586534/,When does the 'learning curve' of innovative interventions become questionable practice?,"Demand for less invasive surgical intervention has increased in recent years resulting in surgeons occasionally being pressurised into adopting new techniques before evidence of safety and efficacy has been established. Unlike pharmaceutical research, most innovative surgical procedures enter surgical practice without regulatory oversight. This anomaly was recently highlighted in the 'Bristol Report' resulting in a recommendation that unproven therapies or surgical techniques be subjected to ethical overview or independent oversight. When a novel technique is introduced, the surgeon will find himself/herself gaining proficiency and experience on suitable patients. Hence the surgeon embarks on a 'learning curve'. A learning curve can be defined as a graphic representation showing the relationship between experience with a procedure and outcome. Studies demonstrate that learning curves generally 'flatten out' as experience increases, resulting in fewer complications and less of a need to convert to the standard procedure. In addition to lack of regulatory oversight, it is this learning curve that gives rise to many ethical and legal dilemmas. This paper considers the ethical issues relating to a surgeon's candour and clinical equipoise, the legal standard of care in a negligence action and the ethical and legal implications regarding risk disclosure during informed consent. The paper concludes by considering a more patient centred approach where new and innovative therapies are being considered in order to ensure good medical practice and avoid litigation for allegations of negligence or breach of human rights.",,P Healey;J Samanta

The results provide considerable support for the hypothesis that surgeons shift the demand for operations. Other things equal, a 10 percent increase in the surgeon/population ratio results in about a 3 percent increase in per capita utilization. Moreover, differences in supply seem to have a perverse effect on fees, raising them when the surgeon/population ratio increases. Surgeon supply is in part determined by factors unrelated to demand, especially by the attractiveness of the area as a place to live.",,V R Fuchs

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17120958/,Linking processes and outcomes to improve surgical performance: a new approach to morbidity and mortality peer review,"Peer review of surgical cases resulting in death or potentially avoidable complications is a longstanding tradition, but intensive reviews of individual cases rarely produces tangible improvements in clinical outcomes. The systematic comparison of care received by patients who experienced adverse outcomes to care received by patients who had uneventful surgical courses is a promising alternative to intensive case review. However, the results of these studies may be misleading because physicians often choose interventions based on their perceptions of patients' preoperative risks, and higher adverse outcome rates among patients with higher preoperative risk may distort comparisons of alternative interventions. The creation of a control sample by carefully matching each patient who experienced an adverse outcome to a patient who had a similar preoperative risk but did not experience an adverse outcome can overcome this problem and provide excellent insight into how to improve clinical performance most effectively and efficiently. By using currently available electronic data to compute each patient's risk of an adverse outcome, a series of cases with adverse outcomes can be matched to an equal number of controls. Peer review committees can then direct focused data collection and analyses of potentially critical processes of care to determine which, if any, are associated with significantly poorer clinical results. A simulated scenario is analyzed in detail to illustrate the ability of this technique to correctly determine best practices when other approaches fail to do so.",,Michael Pine;Donald E Fry

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9743483/,Surgical pathophysiology and disease management during the centuries,"During the centuries the pathophysiological concept of illness underwent drastic changes, depending on medical discoveries and religious belief. There is evidences of surgical practice in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece 2000 years B.C., but we have to wait the Roman Empire with Celso, Galeno, and most of all Asclepiade and Temisone to appreciate the endeavor to rationally understand diseases as an alteration among different body constituents and not only as divine will. During the Middle Ages, when medicine was disputed by clergy, Ugo and Teodorico Borgognone perceived by intuition the problem of sepsis in patient recovery. This problem was cleared up six centuries later by Semmelweis with his antisepsis. Discoveries of blood circulation, hemostasis, anesthesia, and antisepsis in the 17th and 19th centuries permitted better disease management and have promoted, since the 1950s, pathophysiology as an autonomous discipline. Now pathophysiological mechanisms are used for comprehension of several diseases, such as gallstone formation, peptic ulcers, cranial trauma, cardiovascular abnormalities, and many others, to suggest to us which are the better surgical or clinical trials to realize, while observing caution about their limits and consequences.

We reviewed our institutional database for the first 70 consecutive RLPs performed by a single surgeon (DS) over a 21-month period (March 2003 to December 2004). Surgical, pathologic and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. In order to evaluate the impact of the surgeon's and institution's learning curve on outcomes, the cases were divided into quartiles and stratified accordingly to identify trends. Ninety-nine percent (69/70) of all procedures were successfully completed robotically. Mean blood loss, operative time and mean length of stay were 231 ml, 264 min and 1.9 days, respectively. At follow-up, 76% of all patients were fully continent (no pads) and 93% (62/67) had undetectable PSA. The most dramatic improvement in surgical outcomes was seen within the first quartile of cases; however a statistically significant improvement trend existed throughout the series. This included a downward trend in operative time (P < 0.00001), estimated blood loss (P < 0.00001), and length of hospital stay (P = 0.003).

It is generally accepted that numerous interactions must be performed by the surgical team to control the corresponding medical system to retrieve the desired information.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9079422/,"Virtual reality, telesurgery, and the new world order of medicine","We are seeing the emergence of medical applications for virtual reality (VR). These include telepresence surgery, three-dimensional (3-D) visualization of anatomy for medical education, VR surgical simulators, and virtual prototyping of surgical equipment and operating rooms. Today, approximately 90% of the knowledge a physician requires can be obtained through electronic means, such as diagnostic sensors and imaging modalities, directly seeing the patient with a video camera for medical consultation, or using electronic medical records. In addition, with telepresence, a therapy can be effected electronically, regardless of the physical location of the patient. Therefore, it makes sense to send the electronic information or manipulation, rather than sending the patient or blood samples, to obtain tests or to produce a cure. In that these applications are mediated through the computer interface, they are the embodiment of VR as the major force for change in the field of medicine. The Green Telepresence Surgery System consists of two components, the surgical workstation and the remote worksite. At the remote site are a 3-D camera system and responsive manipulators with sensory input. At the workstation are a 3-D monitor and dexterous handles with force feedback. The next generation in medical education can learn anatomy from a new perspective by ""flying"" inside and around the organs, using sophisticated computer systems and 3-D visualization. The VR surgical simulator is a stylized recreation of the human abdomen with several essential organs. Using this, students and surgeons can practice surgical procedures with virtual scalpels and clamps. To support these advanced technologies, the operating room and hospital of the future will first be designed and tested in virtual reality, allowing multiple iterations of equipment and surgical rooms before they are actually built. Insofar as all these technologies are based on digital information, they are the building blocks for the digital physician of the 21st century.",,R M Satava

We conducted a 10-year retrospective study of blunt spleen and liver injuries at a state-designated Level I trauma center and a survey of chief residents' operative experience with splenic and hepatic injuries from blunt trauma during the same time period. From 1990 through 1999, 431 patients were admitted with splenic injuries and 634 patients were admitted with liver injuries; 350 splenic injuries (81%) were due to blunt trauma; 317 liver injuries (50%) were caused by blunt mechanisms. In 1990 100 per cent of patients with splenic injuries and 93 per cent of those with liver injuries underwent surgery for those injuries. These rates were 19 and 28 per cent respectively in 1999. The number of patients with blunt solid visceral injuries increased more than fourfold from 1990 through 1999. The number of operations for splenic and hepatic injuries performed by chief residents did not decline significantly during this time period (5.5 cases per chief resident in 1990; 4.6 cases per chief resident in 1999). The increased numbers of patients with solid visceral injuries were due to two factors: increased proportion of blunt trauma admissions especially from motor vehicle collisions and improved recognition of spleen and liver injuries by expanded use of CT scans. We conclude that nonoperative management of blunt solid visceral injuries does not necessarily lead to a diminution of operations nor jeopardize resident education. However, trauma volumes must be high enough to support adequate operative experience.",,G R Jennings;G V Poole;N L Yates;R K Johnson;M Brock

There was a similar fall in days on call for trauma from 60 to 23 days and a decline in total emergency surgical operations from 6.6 to 5.2 operations per night on call. These changes have mainly been produced by an increase in the number of consultants in the hospital from five to eight and specialisation with the establishment of an area urology unit.

This is the only way to avoid serious complications. Furthermore, the type of operation and selection of patients have to consider these factors. Risky patients should not be operated on in hospitals without an anaesthesiologist. In a single-man-anaesthesia department the surgical colleagues should be temporarily transferred to assist in the anaesthesiologic department.

Traditionally, operative expertise has been acquired through a system of apprenticeships. Pettigrew has shown that operative performance is the main factor in determining postoperative complications and therefore the length of hospital stay, and surgical journals have recently returned to technique as a topic of debate. Certain skills, such as knot tying, can be learned and tested outside the operating theatre, and this has been extended to craft workshops dealing with more complex procedures, including fracture fixation. This article describes an anastomosis workshop held in New Zealand recently for general surgical trainees.",,P I Allen

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7432016/,Surgical utilization in the U.S.A,"Data complied by The National Center for Health Statistics show that surgical utilization has increased dramatically, particularly during 1971-1977 (+34 per cent). Increases were greater among females than males, primarily because of an increase in gynecologic surgery. The 15-year-and-younger cohort was the only age group that did not show an increase, while surgical patients per 1,000 increased consistently with advancing age. Many factors probably have contributed to the increase in surgical utilization, yet the one factor which as been suggested more frequently than any other is surgical manpower (there may be too many doctors performing surgery for the needs of the population and this situation may lead to excessive surgery). This issue of how many physicians there should be in surgical training is widely disputed and politically volatile, however. The problems inherent in estimating future manpower requirements are many, making it hard to derive ""optimal"" distribution patterns.",,E G McCarthy;M L Finkel
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20120994/,Laparoscopic training in India: need for criterion-based training and objective assessment of surgical skills,"Over the past 2 decades, laparoscopic techniques have evolved from diagnostic laparoscopy to more complex procedures. Minimally invasive techniques are routinely used for bariatric, colonic and advanced gastrointestinal surgical procedures. These new techniques require highly developed psychomotor skills and place an extra demand upon surgeons to acquire, maintain and develop a wide range of operative skills in the middle of their careers. In developed countries, training is imparted in skills centres, which use various models not only to teach a skill, but also as a means of assessment, both of technical competence and of decision-making. In addition, these centres are playing an expanding role in providing credentials to surgeons and maintaining the standards of skills. In India, laparoscopic training for community surgeons is unstructured and opportunistic, while resident's training is not uniform. There is a need for structured training programmes that include giving residents and community surgeons experience in skills laboratories, alongwith an objective assessment of acquired skills.",,Avinash N Supe
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7455900/,Surgical rates in the United States: 1966 to 1978,"A dominant belief throughout the last half of the 1970s was that operative rates in the United States continued to show steady increases. This strongly suggested that an excessive number of operations were being performed. Unsubstantiated statements regarding surgical rates have been accepted at face value, and little critical analysis of the situation has occurred. This study utilizes data from the National Center for Health Statistics as the basis for an in-depth analysis of surgical rates in the United States from 1966 to 1978. All rates have been age-sex standardized. During the 13-year study period, operative rates increased by 26%. The major portion of that growth took place between 1966 and 1974. After that time, the rates leveled off and increased by only 2%. General surgery, gynecology, otorhinolaryngology, and urology have demonstrated decreasing rates of operation since 1974. Neurosurgery, ophthalmology, and cardiac surgery experienced sustained increases in growth during the study years. From 1966 through 1978 there was a steady growth in the total number of surgeons practicing within any given specialty. Through this study we were unable to document any correlation between the number of surgeons practicing a specialty and an increase in that specialty's surgical rates. The belief that operative rates will inevitably rise as the total number of surgeons increases is not supported by this report.",,I M Rutkow;G D Zuidema
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1828943/,Establishment of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy training program,"A recently developed alternative to traditional laparotomy and cholecystectomy is laparoscopic-guided cholecystectomy. This procedure has the advantages of reduced hospital stay, early return to work, diminished abdominal wall scarring, and less patient discomfort. The complex nature of this procedure and the current lack of extensive clinical experience preclude the traditional ""hands-on"" training normally practiced in surgical residency programs. At the University of Maryland, we have developed a program to instruct both surgeons and surgical residents in the techniques of laparoscopic surgery. Technical competence is achieved under the close supervision and guidance of an experienced laparoscopic surgeon. Training of residents in this procedure, therefore, is not very different than that for other general surgical procedures. Surgeons already in clinical practice, however, gain experience under somewhat different circumstances. Initial training involves didactic instruction through laparoscopic surgical atlases and educational videotapes. Further training uses a simulation device which enables the trainee to practice techniques of laparoscopic suturing, knot-tying, and clip application. Actual operative experience is acquired primarily in experimental animal preparations. Laparoscopic-guided removal of the gallbladder is performed in young swine (20-25 kg) under conditions that mimic those in the operating room. Further clinical experience can be acquired by assisting on several laparoscopic operations, usually involving diagnostic or pelvic procedures. Actual operative experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomy, of course, comprises the final phase of the educational program. The introduction of clinical laparoscopic training into general surgery residency programs should influence the widespread adoption of this new procedure.",,R W Bailey;A L Imbembo;K A Zucker
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1547373/,Postgraduate education and role of surgical research in Germany,"In Germany at the very moment we have general surgery and 5 specialties, they are: traumatic, plastic and reconstructive, cardiac and central vessels as well as pediatric surgery. For qualification as a general surgeon one needs at least 6 years of straight training; two more years are necessary to qualify in one of the mentioned specialties. In some specialties one year of training can be taken into account for general surgery. The postgraduate education in each field requires a precisely defined kind and number of operations as well as an examination. There are some considerations in discussion, which should be outlined: Generally speaking this means, that the basis of 6 years of general surgery may be reduced to 4 years. Thus specialization could be started 2 years earlier. This special point is in strong discussion due to the fact that the surgical skillfulness of the young surgeons may be decreased. In university hospitals and in academic teaching hospitals surgical research is realized within the surgical department as well as in special departments for experimental surgery. The ideal would be that both institutions stimulate each other.",,W Hartel

On average a Senior House Officer (SHO) operating as the principal surgeon performed 15 appendicectomies (range 7-26), 17 inguinal herniorrhaphies (range 7-42) and 17 varicose vein operations (range 5-33) over their first 12 months. The senior author, as a first year SHO in 1985, performed 23 appendicectomies, 36 inguinal herniorrhaphies and 18 varicose vein operations as the principal surgeon. The operative supervision of SHOs provided either by the Consultant or the Registrar varied widely between units despite a uniformity in available training operations. Clearly many opportunities are being lost within the region and greater organisation is necessary in some units to capitalise on existing training opportunities and thus optimise SHO training. In general, it is still possible, despite the reduction in working hours, for SHOs to receive similar operative experience now as was possible 13 years ago.",,P A Hurley;S Paterson-Brown

This study assessed the implications for a single health board. A questionnaire listing 13 representative operations was sent to 44 trainees and 52 trainers to determine the number of operations a trainee should perform. The total number of operations required for training was compared against the total actually performed across the health board. Operating times for five representative operations were audited prospectively. Trainers and trainees recommended a similar and conservative number of operations. The total number of operations available for training (4913) was 38% less than the number recommended (7946). Trainees required 50-75% more operating time than consultants. To increase the proportion of operations undertaken by trainees from the current 30% to 70% would require an extra 270 theatre days (of pounds 1.3m) yearly. The minimum number of operations required for training must be defined and the proportion of supervised operations undertaken by trainees substantially increased.

The introduction of a camera into the body of a patient, allowing the visual display of the operative procedure through the use of a miniaturized camera, constitutes the greatest change that the surgical world has experienced at the end of this century: mini-invasive surgery is born. This revolution also predicts further changes: the development of telecommunication devices applied to medicine (tele-education, tele-training, tele-mentoring, tele-proctoring and tele-accreditation), constitutes the basis of cybersurgery or virtual reality allowing the merging of the concepts of tele-presence and telemanipulation. These new concepts were developed at the European Institute of TeleSurgery at Strasbourg. The TESUS project developed the use of surgical images and data transmission through the realization of international multi-site video conferences between surgeons. The WEBS project created the first virtual university concept by placing surgical techniques at the surgeon's disposal through the Internet. The HESSOS project uses virtual reality as a surgical simulation system. The MASTER project allows the development of the concept of distant telemanipulation.

The surgeons in this surgical unit prospectively documented details of all operations and endoscopic procedures (caseload) on a database. Over a six-month period the workload was calculated by weighting the caseload using Intermediate Equivalent (IE) values. Some 1827 procedures were documented. The three consultants performed 796 (44 per cent) procedures, the senior registrar (SR) 137 (7.5 per cent), the registrar 241 (13 per cent) and the three senior house officers (SHO) 644 (35 per cent). The consultant was first assistant in 185 (66 per cent) procedures performed by the SHOs, in 52 (61 per cent) by the registrar in 9 (13 per cent) by the SR. When assessed by caseload one SHO (as a representative example) performed 224 procedures compared to 137 by the SR. The IE workloads were 156 and 166 respectively. This better reflected the greater complexity of the operations performed by the SR. This study has shown that details of surgical training can be easily retrieved from existing administrative databases. This can be used to document the number and type of operations performed by a trainee and the degree of consultant supervision.

Because efficiency is particularly important in day surgery and lower third molar removal is a high-volume procedure, the need for which is responsible for particularly long waiting-lists in almost all UK health regions, this operation was selected for evaluation. A series of 80 consecutive procedures, carried out for 43 day-stay patients under general anaesthesia by seven junior staff (senior house officers and registrars: 39 procedures) and four senior staff (senior registrars and consultants: 41 procedures) were analysed. Median operating time for procedures which required retraction of periosteum was 9.5 min (range 2.7-23.3 min). Where these steps were necessary, median time for incision was 25 s (range 10-90 s); for retraction of periosteum, 79 s (range 5-340 s); for bone removal, 118 s (range 10-380 s); for tooth excision, 131 s (range 10-900 s); for debridement, 74 s (range 5-270 s); and for suture, 144 s (range 25-320 s). Junior surgeons could be differentiated from senior surgeons on the basis of omission, repetition and duration of these steps. Juniors omitted retraction of periosteum in 10% of procedures (seniors 23%) and suture in 13% (seniors 32%). Juniors repeated steps in 47% of operations; seniors, 14%. Junior surgeons took significantly more time than senior surgeons for incision, bone removal and tooth excision.
