https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32830223/,Metabolism,"Metabolism consists of a series of reactions that occur within cells of living organisms to sustain life. The process of metabolism involves many interconnected cellular pathways to ultimately provide cells with the energy required to carry out their function. The importance and the evolutionary advantage of these pathways can be seen as many remain unchanged by animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria. In eukaryotes, the metabolic pathways occur within the cytosol and mitochondria of cells with the utilisation of glucose or fatty acids providing the majority of cellular energy in animals. Metabolism is organised into distinct metabolic pathways to either maximise the capture of energy or minimise its use. Metabolism can be split into a series of chemical reactions that comprise both the synthesis and degradation of complex macromolecules known as anabolism or catabolism, respectively. The basic principles of energy consumption and production are discussed, alongside the biochemical pathways that make up fundamental metabolic processes for life.",biochemistry; glycolysis; metabolism.,Ayesha Judge;Michael S Dodd

These demands lead to differential requirements in energy, biosynthetic precursors, and signaling intermediates. Both genetic programs arising from oncogenic events and transcriptional programs and epigenomic events are important in providing the necessary metabolic network activity. Accumulating evidence has established that environmental factors play a major role in shaping cancer cell metabolism. For metabolism, diet and nutrition are the major environmental aspects and have emerged as key components in determining cancer cell metabolism. In this review, we discuss these emerging concepts in cancer metabolism and how diet and nutrition influence cancer cell metabolism.",,Shree Bose;Annamarie E Allen;Jason W Locasale
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32698040/,Cholesterol metabolism: New functions and therapeutic approaches in cancer,"Cholesterol and its metabolites (precursors and derivatives) play an important role in cancer. In recent years, numerous studies have reported the functions of cholesterol metabolism in the regulation of tumor biological processes, especially oncogenic signaling pathways, ferroptosis, and tumor microenvironment. Preclinical studies have over the years indicated the inhibitory effects of blocking cholesterol synthesis and uptake on tumor formation and growth. Besides, some new cholesterol metabolic molecules such as SOAT1, SQLE, and NPC1 have recently emerged as promising drug targets for cancer treatment. Here, we systematically review the roles of cholesterol and its metabolites, and the latest advances in cancer therapy targeting cholesterol metabolism.",Cancer treatment; Cholesterol; Functions; Metabolism.,Huanji Xu;Sheng Zhou;Qiulin Tang;Hongwei Xia;Feng Bi

The performance of these cell culture processes, in terms of both productivity and product quality attributes, is significantly influenced by cellular metabolism. Glucose is the major carbon source for cellular biosynthesis and energy generation. We summarize here recent advances in our understanding of the regulation of glucose metabolism in cultured cells. The versatility of cells to sustain homeostatic states under widely varying environments is made possible by allosteric regulation of the metabolic network, interplay between the signaling pathways, and transcription factors. Understanding the regulation of metabolism holds the key to altering the metabolic regulatory circuit and implementing direct metabolic control over cell culture processes.",allosteric regulation; biologics; bioprocess; cell culture; metabolism.,Bhanu Chandra Mulukutla;Andrew Yongky;Tung Le;Douglas G Mashek;Wei-Shou Hu

Its metabolism has been the subject of extensive investigation and much is known about its regulation by hormones such as insulin, glucagon and adrenaline (epinephrine). There has been debate over the relative importance of allosteric compared with covalent control of the key biosynthetic enzyme, glycogen synthase, as well as the relative importance of glucose entry into cells compared with glycogen synthase regulation in determining glycogen accumulation. Significant new developments in eukaryotic glycogen metabolism over the last decade or so include: (i) three-dimensional structures of the biosynthetic enzymes glycogenin and glycogen synthase, with associated implications for mechanism and control; (ii) analyses of several genetically engineered mice with altered glycogen metabolism that shed light on the mechanism of control; (iii) greater appreciation of the spatial aspects of glycogen metabolism, including more focus on the lysosomal degradation of glycogen; and (iv) glycogen phosphorylation and advances in the study of Lafora disease, which is emerging as a glycogen storage disease.",,Peter J Roach;Anna A Depaoli-Roach;Thomas D Hurley;Vincent S Tagliabracci
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32112053/,Tumour metabolism and its unique properties in prostate adenocarcinoma,"Anabolic metabolism mediated by aberrant growth factor signalling fuels tumour growth and progression. The first biochemical descriptions of the altered metabolic nature of solid tumours were reported by Otto Warburg almost a century ago. Now, the study of tumour metabolism is being redefined by the development of new molecular tools, tumour modelling systems and precise instrumentation together with important advances in genetics, cell biology and spectroscopy. In contrast to Warburg's original hypothesis, accumulating evidence demonstrates a critical role for mitochondrial metabolism and substantial variation in the way in which different tumours metabolize nutrients to generate biomass. Furthermore, computational and experimental approaches suggest a dominant influence of the tissue-of-origin in shaping the metabolic reprogramming that enables tumour growth. For example, the unique metabolic properties of prostate adenocarcinoma are likely to stem from the distinct metabolism of the prostatic epithelium from which it emerges. Normal prostatic epithelium employs comparatively glycolytic metabolism to sustain physiological citrate secretion, whereas prostate adenocarcinoma consumes citrate to power oxidative phosphorylation and fuel lipogenesis, enabling tumour progression through metabolic reprogramming. Current data suggest that the distinct metabolic aberrations in prostate adenocarcinoma are driven by the androgen receptor, providing opportunities for functional metabolic imaging and novel therapeutic interventions that will be complementary to existing diagnostic and treatment options.",,David A Bader;Sean E McGuire
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29739666/,Metabolism as a Target for Modulation in Autoimmune Diseases,"Metabolic pathways are now well recognized as important regulators of immune differentiation and activation, and thus influence the development of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) has emerged as a key sensor of metabolic stress and an important mediator of proinflammatory lineage specification. Metabolic pathways control the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), which promote mTOR activation and also modulate the antigenicity of proteins, lipids, and DNA, thus placing ROS at the heart of metabolic disturbances during pathogenesis of SLE. Therefore, we review here the pathways that control ROS production and mTOR activation and identify targets for safe therapeutic modulation of the signaling network that underlies autoimmune diseases, focusing on SLE.",,Nick Huang;Andras Perl
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32694839/,Control strategies in systemic metabolism,"Metabolic control systems coordinate myriad processes across the cellular, tissue and organismal levels to optimize the allocation of limited supplies across multiple, often competing, metabolic demands. As such, the regulation of metabolism can be analysed from the perspective of the economic theory of supply and demand. Here, we discuss how such analyses can provide new insights into the logic of metabolic control. In particular, we suggest that, in addition to being subject to well-appreciated homeostatic control, metabolism is subject to supply-driven and demand-driven controls, each operated by a dedicated set of signals throughout various physiological states, including inflammation. Furthermore, we argue that systemic homeostasis is a derived feature that evolved from the control systems that monitor metabolic supply and demand.",,Jessica Ye;Ruslan Medzhitov

Increased flux through HBP leads to elevated post-translational addition of β-D-N-acetylglucosamine sugars to nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Increased total O-GlcNAcylation is emerging as a general characteristic of cancer cells, and recent studies suggest that O-GlcNAcylation is a central communicator of nutritional status to control key signaling and metabolic pathways that regulate multiple cancer cell phenotypes.

More recently understood is that this metabolic phenotype is not unique to cancer cells but instead reflects characteristics of proliferating cells. Similar metabolic transitions also occur in the immune system as cells transition from resting state to stimulated effectors. A key finding in immune metabolism is that the metabolic programs of different cell subsets are distinctly associated with immunological function. Further, interruption of those metabolic pathways can shift immune cell fate to modulate immunity.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29318410/,Flux analysis of inborn errors of metabolism,"Patients with an inborn error of metabolism (IEM) are deficient of an enzyme involved in metabolism, and as a consequence metabolism reprograms itself to reach a new steady state. This new steady state underlies the clinical phenotype associated with the deficiency. Hence, we need to know the flux of metabolites through the different metabolic pathways in this new steady state of the reprogrammed metabolism. Stable isotope technology is best suited to study this. In this review the progress made in characterizing the altered metabolism will be presented. Studies done in patients to estimate the residual flux through the metabolic pathway affected by enzyme deficiencies will be discussed. After this, studies done in model systems will be reviewed. The focus will be on glycogen storage disease type I, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, propionic and methylmalonic aciduria, urea cycle defects, phenylketonuria, and combined D,L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. Finally, new developments are discussed, which allow the tracing of metabolic reprogramming in IEM on a genome-wide scale.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31841375/,Targeting Cell Metabolism as Cancer Therapy,"Significance: Cancer cells exhibit altered metabolic pathways to keep up with biosynthetic and reduction-oxidation needs during tumor proliferation and metastasis. The common induction of metabolic pathways during cancer progression, regardless of cancer histio- or genotype, makes cancer metabolism an attractive target for therapeutic exploitation. Recent Advances: Emerging data suggest that these altered pathways may even result in resistance to anticancer therapies. Identifying specific metabolic dependencies that are unique to cancer cells has proved challenging in this field, limiting the therapeutic window for many candidate drug approaches. Critical Issues: Cancer cells display significant metabolic flexibility in nutrient-limited environments, hampering the longevity of suppressing cancer metabolism through any singular approach. Combinatorial ""synthetic lethal"" approaches may have a better chance for success and promising strategies are reviewed here. The dynamism of the immune system adds a level of complexity, as various immune populations in the tumor microenvironment often share metabolic pathways with cancer, with successive alterations during immune activation and quiescence. Decoding the reprogramming of metabolic pathways within cancer cells and stem cells, as well as examining metabolic symbiosis between components of the tumor microenvironment, would be essential to further meaningful drug development within the tumor's metabolic ecosystem. Future Directions: In this article, we examine evidence for the therapeutic potential of targeting metabolic alterations in cancer, and we discuss the drawbacks and successes that have stimulated this field.",cancer therapy; cell metabolism; metabolic vulnerability.,Natalie Y L Ngoi;Jie Qing Eu;Jayshree Hirpara;Lingzhi Wang;Joline S J Lim;Soo-Chin Lee;Yaw-Chyn Lim;Shazib Pervaiz;Boon Cher Goh;Andrea L A Wong

These interactions are diverse and often not understood. However, the growing knowledge about convergently evolved pathways offers an expansive toolbox to engineer novel, hybrid pathways that could circumvent current problems by recruiting the host 'underground metabolism'.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19460998/,Understanding the Warburg effect: the metabolic requirements of cell proliferation,"In contrast to normal differentiated cells, which rely primarily on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to generate the energy needed for cellular processes, most cancer cells instead rely on aerobic glycolysis, a phenomenon termed ""the Warburg effect."" Aerobic glycolysis is an inefficient way to generate adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), however, and the advantage it confers to cancer cells has been unclear. Here we propose that the metabolism of cancer cells, and indeed all proliferating cells, is adapted to facilitate the uptake and incorporation of nutrients into the biomass (e.g., nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids) needed to produce a new cell. Supporting this idea are recent studies showing that (i) several signaling pathways implicated in cell proliferation also regulate metabolic pathways that incorporate nutrients into biomass; and that (ii) certain cancer-associated mutations enable cancer cells to acquire and metabolize nutrients in a manner conducive to proliferation rather than efficient ATP production. A better understanding of the mechanistic links between cellular metabolism and growth control may ultimately lead to better treatments for human cancer.",,Matthew G Vander Heiden;Lewis C Cantley;Craig B Thompson
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32925942/,Genetic buffering and potentiation in metabolism,"Cells adjust their metabolism in response to mutations, but how this reprogramming depends on the genetic context is not well known. Specifically, the absence of individual enzymes can affect reprogramming, and thus the impact of mutations in cell growth. Here, we examine this issue with an in silico model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae's metabolism. By quantifying the variability in the growth rate of 10000 different mutant metabolisms that accumulated changes in their reaction fluxes, in the presence, or absence, of a specific enzyme, we distinguish a subset of modifier genes serving as buffers or potentiators of variability. We notice that the most potent modifiers refer to the glycolysis pathway and that, more broadly, they show strong pleiotropy and epistasis. Moreover, the evidence that this subset depends on the specific growing condition strengthens its systemic underpinning, a feature only observed before in a toy model of a gene-regulatory network. Some of these enzymes also modulate the effect that biochemical noise and environmental fluctuations produce in growth. Thus, the reorganization of metabolism induced by mutations has not only direct physiological implications but also transforms the influence that other mutations have on growth. This is a general result with implications in the development of cancer therapies based on metabolic inhibitors.",,Juan F Poyatos
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30715457/,Exploiting enzyme promiscuity to shape plant specialized metabolism,"The amazing variability of plant metabolism and its rapid divergence during evolution pose fundamental questions as to the driving forces, mechanisms, and players in metabolic differentiation. This review examines concepts that help us understand adaptive pathway evolution, with a particular emphasis on plant specialized metabolism, previously often termed secondary metabolism. Following a general introduction to pathway and metabolite evolution, the focus is directed to enzyme promiscuity and its classification. Promiscuous enzymes (or substrates), 'silent' elements of the metabolome, and the 'underground metabolism' may be used and combined to evolve 'new' metabolic pathways. It appears that new pathways rarely appear from scratch, but instead emerge from 'floppy' enzymes and elements of a 'messy' metabolism, and in this way a range of metabolites is generated, some of which may provide benefits to the plant.",Biological messiness; enzyme promiscuity; metabolic diversification; natural products; pathway evolution; silent metabolism; specialized metabolism; underground metabolism.,Wolfgang Kreis;Jennifer Munkert

Upon encountering danger signals, these cells undergo activation leading to a modulation in their immune functions. However, recent studies reveal that immune cells upon activation also show distinct metabolic changes that impact their immune functions. Such metabolic reprogramming and its functional effects are well known for cancer cells. Given that immune cells have emerged as crucial players in cancer progression, it is important to understand whether immune cells also undergo metabolic reprogramming in tumors and how this might affect their contribution in cancer progression.

As increasingly more genomes are sequenced, this lightpost effect may account at least in part for our failure to understand the function of a continuously growing number of genes. Core metabolism often goes astray, accidentally producing a variety of unexpected compounds. Catabolism of these forgotten metabolites makes an essential part of the functions coded in metagenomes. Here, I explore the fate of a limited number of those: compounds resulting from radical reactions and molecules derived from some reactive intermediates produced during normal metabolism. I try both to update investigators with the most recent literature and to uncover old articles that may open up new research avenues in the genome exploration of metabolism.

Recent findings suggest that chemiosmotic coupling enzymes known from their use in methylotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens-in addition to unique terminal reductases-biochemically facilitate energy conservation during complete CH4 oxidation to CO2.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27557541/,Mathematical Modeling of Cellular Metabolism,"Cellular metabolism basically consists of the conversion of chemical compounds taken up from the extracellular environment into energy (conserved in energy-rich bonds of organic phosphates) and a wide array of organic molecules serving as catalysts (enzymes), information carriers (nucleic acids), and building blocks for cellular structures such as membranes or ribosomes. Metabolic modeling aims at the construction of mathematical representations of the cellular metabolism that can be used to calculate the concentration of cellular molecules and the rates of their mutual chemical interconversion in response to varying external conditions as, for example, hormonal stimuli or supply of essential nutrients. Based on such calculations, it is possible to quantify complex cellular functions as cellular growth, detoxification of drugs and xenobiotic compounds or synthesis of exported molecules. Depending on the specific questions to metabolism addressed, the methodological expertise of the researcher, and available experimental information, different conceptual frameworks have been established, allowing the usage of computational methods to condense experimental information from various layers of organization into (self-) consistent models.

In this review, we discuss the breadth and depth of metabolic flexibility and its impact on health and disease. Metabolic flexibility is essential to maintain energy homeostasis in times of either caloric excess or caloric restriction, and in times of either low or high energy demand, such as during exercise. The liver, adipose tissue, and muscle govern systemic metabolic flexibility and manage nutrient sensing, uptake, transport, storage, and expenditure by communication via endocrine cues. At a molecular level, metabolic flexibility relies on the configuration of metabolic pathways, which are regulated by key metabolic enzymes and transcription factors, many of which interact closely with the mitochondria. Disrupted metabolic flexibility, or metabolic inflexibility, however, is associated with many pathological conditions including metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cancer. Multiple factors such as dietary composition and feeding frequency, exercise training, and use of pharmacological compounds, influence metabolic flexibility and will be discussed here.

Consequently, microbial communities have adapted and evolved to utilize these compounds as sole carbon source, under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The constitutive expression of enzymes necessary for metabolism imposes a heavy energy load on the microbe which is overcome by arrangement of degradative genes as operons which are induced by specific inducers. The segmentation of pathways into upper, middle and/or lower operons has allowed microbes to funnel multiple compounds into common key aromatic intermediates which are further metabolized through central carbon pathway. Various proteins belonging to diverse families have evolved to regulate the transcription of individual operons participating in aromatic catabolism. These proteins, complemented with global regulatory mechanisms, carry out the regulation of aromatic compound metabolic pathways in a concerted manner. Additionally, characteristics like chemotaxis, preferential utilization, pathway compartmentalization and biosurfactant production confer an advantage to the microbe, thus making bioremediation of the aromatic pollutants more efficient and effective.",Aerobic degradation; Anaerobic degradation; Biosurfactants; Chemotaxis; Compartmentalization; Global regulation and regulatory systems; Inducer; Mono- and poly-aromatic compounds; Oxygenases.,Prashant S Phale;Harshit Malhotra;Bhavik A Shah

L-Carnitine can also be found in many foods, but red meats, such as beef and lamb, are the best choices for adding carnitine into the diet. Good carnitine sources also include fish, poultry and milk. Essentially, L-carnitine transports the chains of fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix, thus allowing the cells to break down fat and get energy from the stored fat reserves. Recent studies have started to shed light on the beneficial effects of L-carnitine when used in various clinical therapies. Because L-carnitine and its esters help reduce oxidative stress, they have been proposed as a treatment for many conditions, i.e. heart failure, angina and weight loss. For other conditions, such as fatigue or improving exercise performance, L-carnitine appears safe but does not seem to have a significant effect. The presented review of the literature suggests that continued studies are required before L-carnitine administration could be recommended as a routine procedure in the noted disorders. Further research is warranted in order to evaluate the biochemical, pharmacological, and physiological determinants of the response to carnitine supplementation, as well as to determine the potential benefits of carnitine supplements in selected categories of individuals who do not have fatty acid oxidation defects.",,Jolanta Pekala;Bozena Patkowska-Sokoła;Robert Bodkowski;Dorota Jamroz;Piotr Nowakowski;Stanisław Lochyński;Tadeusz Librowski
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25435320/,Plasticity of specialized metabolism as mediated by dynamic metabolons,"The formation of specialized metabolites enables plants to respond to biotic and abiotic stresses, but requires the sequential action of multiple enzymes. To facilitate swift production and to avoid leakage of potentially toxic and labile intermediates, many of the biosynthetic pathways are thought to organize in multienzyme clusters termed metabolons. Dynamic assembly and disassembly enable the plant to rapidly switch the product profile and thereby prioritize its resources.

When these yeasts grow on methanol, the genes encoding enzymes and proteins involved in methanol metabolism are strongly induced. Simultaneously, peroxisomes, organelles that contain the key enzymes for methanol metabolism, massively proliferate. These characteristics have made methylotrophic yeasts efficient hosts for heterologous protein production using strong and methanol-inducible gene promoters and also model organisms for the study of peroxisome dynamics. Much attention has been paid to the interaction between methylotrophic microorganisms and plants. In this chapter, we describe how methylotrophic yeasts proliferate and survive on plant leaves, focusing on their physiological functions and lifestyle in the phyllosphere. Our current understanding of the molecular basis of methanol-inducible gene expression, including methanol-sensing and its applications, is also summarized.",,Hiroya Yurimoto;Yasuyoshi Sakai

Human genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) were reconstructed within systems biology to study the biochemistry occurring in human cells. However, the complexity of these networks hinders a consistent and concise physiological representation. We present here redHUMAN, a workflow for reconstructing reduced models that focus on parts of the metabolism relevant to a specific physiology using the recently established methods redGEM and lumpGEM. The reductions include the thermodynamic properties of compounds and reactions guaranteeing the consistency of predictions with the bioenergetics of the cell. We introduce a method (redGEMX) to incorporate the pathways used by cells to adapt to the medium. We provide the thermodynamic curation of the human GEMs Recon2 and Recon3D and we apply the redHUMAN workflow to derive leukemia-specific reduced models.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30245465/,Molecular pathways associated with oxidative stress in diabetes mellitus,"The role of oxidative stress in the occurrence and development of diabetes mellitus is both critical and pivotal. Several molecular event cascade in different metabolic pathways such as glycolytic, hexosamine, protein kinase C, polyol and advanced glycation end-product (AGE) pathways have been identified as pro-oxidative processes and are usually up-regulated in the diabetics. Inhibition of glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase by poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 and subsequent accumulation of the enzyme substrate (glyceraldehyde-3-P) appears to be central to diabetes-associated oxidative stress. Increased level of glyceraldehyde-3-P activates two major pro-oxidative pathways in diabetes: (i) It activates the AGE pathway, precisely the synthesis of methylglyoxal from non-enzymatic dephosphorylation of the triose phosphates (ii) It activates protein kinase C (PKC) pathway by promoting the synthesis of diacylglycerol. In addition, it causes the accumulation of glycolytic metabolites upstream, and this leads to excessive stimulation of other pro-oxidative pathways such as hexosamine and polyol pathways. This review tends to highlight the main oxidative processes associated with diabetes mellitus.",AGEs; Diabetes mellitus; Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; Oxidative stress.,Osasenaga Macdonald Ighodaro

Mounting focus has been dedicated to investigating the role of these metabolites during neurodevelopment and elucidating their involvement in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders with a developmental component, such as schizophrenia. In this review, we describe the changes in KP metabolism in the brain from gestation until adulthood and illustrate how environmental and genetic factors affect the KP during development. With a particular focus on kynurenic acid, the antagonist of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine (α7nACh) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, both implicated in modulating brain development, we review animal models designed to ascertain the role of perinatal KP elevation on long-lasting biochemical, neuropathological, and behavioral deficits later in life. We present new data demonstrating that combining perinatal choline-supplementation, to potentially increase activation of α7nACh receptors during development, with embryonic kynurenine manipulation is effective in attenuating cognitive impairments in adult rat offspring. With these findings in mind, we conclude the review by discussing the advancement of therapeutic interventions that would target not only symptoms, but potentially the root cause of central nervous system diseases that manifest from a perinatal KP insult.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25227915/,Chemical reactivity drives spatiotemporal organisation of bacterial metabolism,"In this review, we examine how bacterial metabolism is shaped by chemical constraints acting on the material and dynamic layout of enzymatic networks and beyond. These are moulded not only for optimisation of given metabolic objectives (e.g. synthesis of a particular amino acid or nucleotide) but also for curbing the detrimental reactivity of chemical intermediates. Besides substrate channelling, toxicity is avoided by barriers to free diffusion (i.e. compartments) that separate otherwise incompatible reactions, along with ways for distinguishing damaging vs. harmless molecules. On the other hand, enzymes age and their operating lifetime must be tuned to upstream and downstream reactions. This time dependence of metabolic pathways creates time-linked information, learning and memory. These features suggest that the physical structure of existing biosystems, from operon assemblies to multicellular development may ultimately stem from the need to restrain chemical damage and limit the waste inherent to basic metabolic functions.

To do this, it must be able to efficiently acquire sufficient nutrients from its environment to support its survival and rapid growth in the intestine. However, despite almost 50 years of research, many aspects as to how C. jejuni accomplishes this feat remain poorly understood. C. jejuni lacks many of the common metabolic pathways necessary for the use of glucose, galactose, or other carbohydrates upon which most other microbes thrive. It does however make efficient use of citric acid cycle intermediates and various amino acids. C. jejuni readily uses the amino acids aspartate, glutamate, serine, and proline, with certain strains also possessing additional pathways allowing for the use of glutamine and asparagine. More recent work has revealed that some C. jejuni strains can metabolize the sugar l-fucose. This finding has upset years of dogma that C. jejuni is an asaccharolytic organism. C. jejuni also possesses diverse mechanisms for the acquisition of various transition metals that are required for metabolic activities. In particular, iron acquisition is critical for the formation of iron-sulfur complexes.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23296366/,"Metabolite proofreading, a neglected aspect of intermediary metabolism","Enzymes of intermediary metabolism are less specific than what is usually assumed: they often act on metabolites that are not their 'true' substrate, making abnormal metabolites that may be deleterious if they accumulate. Some of these abnormal metabolites are reconverted to normal metabolites by repair enzymes, which play therefore a role akin to the proofreading activities of DNA polymerases and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. An illustrative example of such repair enzymes is L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase, which eliminates a metabolite abnormally made by a Krebs cycle enzyme. Mutations in L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase lead to L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, a leukoencephalopathy. Other examples are the epimerase and the ATP-dependent dehydratase that repair hydrated forms of NADH and NADPH; ethylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase, which eliminates an abnormal metabolite formed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase, an enzyme of fatty acid synthesis; L-pipecolate oxidase, which repairs a metabolite formed by a side activity of an enzyme of L-proline biosynthesis.

For example, diacylglycerol (DAG) is a biosynthetic and catabolic intermediate of many different lipid classes. Triacylglycerol can be synthesized from DAG assembled de novo, or from DAG produced by catabolism of membrane lipids, most commonly phosphatidylcholine. Quantification of lipids provides a snapshot of the lipid abundance at the time they were extracted from the given tissue. However, quantification alone does not provide information on the path of carbon flux through the metabolic network to synthesize each lipid. Understanding lipid metabolic flux requires tracing lipid metabolism with isotopically labeled substrates over time in living tissue.

Metagenomic shotgun sequencing of microbial gut communities revealed that Prevotella copri is one of the most important players in the gastrointestinal tract of many individuals. Because of the importance of this bacterium we analyzed the growth behavior and the central metabolic pathways of P. copri. Bioinformatic data, transcriptome profiling and enzyme activity measurements indicated that the major pathways are based on glycolysis and succinate production from fumarate. In addition, pyruvate can be degraded to acetate and formate. Electron transport phosphorylation depends on fumarate respiration with NADH and reduced ferredoxin as electron donors. In contrast to Bacteroides vulgatus, P. copri showed a more pronounced dependency on the addition of CO2 or bicarbonate for biomass formation, which is a remarkable difference between P. copri and Bacteroides spp. with important implication in the context of gut microbial competition.

It is now well accepted that moderate levels of ROS are required for several cellular functions, including gene expression. The production of ROS is elevated in tumor cells as a consequence of increased metabolic rate, gene mutation and relative hypoxia, and excess ROS are quenched by increased antioxidant enzymatic and nonenzymatic pathways in the same cells. Moderate increases of ROS contribute to several pathologic conditions, among which are tumor promotion and progression, as they are involved in different signaling pathways and induce DNA mutation. However, ROS are also able to trigger programmed cell death (PCD).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23815737/,Metabolism of dimethylsulphoniopropionate by Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3,"Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3 possesses two general pathways for metabolism of dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP), an osmolyte of algae and abundant carbon source for marine bacteria. In the DMSP cleavage pathway, acrylate is transformed into acryloyl-CoA by propionate-CoA ligase (SPO2934) and other unidentified acyl-CoA ligases. Acryloyl-CoA is then reduced to propionyl-CoA by AcuI or SPO1914. Acryloyl-CoA is also rapidly hydrated to 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA by acryloyl-CoA hydratase (SPO0147). A SPO1914 mutant was unable to grow on acrylate as the sole carbon source, supporting its role in this pathway. Similarly, growth on methylmercaptopropionate, the first intermediate of the DMSP demethylation pathway, was severely inhibited by a mutation in the gene encoding crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase, demonstrating that acetate produced by this pathway was metabolized by the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway. Amino acids and nucleosides from cells grown on (13) C-enriched DMSP possessed labelling patterns that were consistent with carbon from DMSP being metabolized by both the ethylmalonyl-CoA and acrylate pathways as well as a role for pyruvate dehydrogenase. This latter conclusion was supported by the phenotype of a pdh mutant, which grew poorly on electron-rich substrates. Additionally, label from [(13) C-methyl] DMSP only appeared in carbons derived from methyl-tetrahydrofolate, and there was no evidence for a serine cycle of C-1 assimilation.",,Chris R Reisch;Warren M Crabb;Scott M Gifford;Quincy Teng;Melissa J Stoudemayer;Mary Ann Moran;William B Whitman
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22768162/,Design constraints on a synthetic metabolism,"A metabolism is a complex network of chemical reactions that converts sources of energy and chemical elements into biomass and other molecules. To design a metabolism from scratch and to implement it in a synthetic genome is almost within technological reach. Ideally, a synthetic metabolism should be able to synthesize a desired spectrum of molecules at a high rate, from multiple different nutrients, while using few chemical reactions, and producing little or no waste. Not all of these properties are achievable simultaneously. We here use a recently developed technique to create random metabolic networks with pre-specified properties to quantify trade-offs between these and other properties. We find that for every additional molecule to be synthesized a network needs on average three additional reactions. For every additional carbon source to be utilized, it needs on average two additional reactions. Networks able to synthesize 20 biomass molecules from each of 20 alternative sole carbon sources need to have at least 260 reactions. This number increases to 518 reactions for networks that can synthesize more than 60 molecules from each of 80 carbon sources. The maximally achievable rate of biosynthesis decreases by approximately 5 percent for every additional molecule to be synthesized. Biochemically related molecules can be synthesized at higher rates, because their synthesis produces less waste. Overall, the variables we study can explain 87 percent of variation in network size and 84 percent of the variation in synthesis rate. The constraints we identify prescribe broad boundary conditions that can help to guide synthetic metabolism design.",,Tugce Bilgin;Andreas Wagner

Here, we investigated the role of the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH), a key center involved in nutrient-dependent metabolic regulation. Specifically, we tested the novel hypothesis that the metabolism of leucine within the MBH couples the central sensing of leucine with the control of glucose production by the liver. We performed either central (MBH) or systemic infusions of leucine in Sprague-Dawley male rats during basal pancreatic insulin clamps in combination with various pharmacological and molecular interventions designed to modulate leucine metabolism in the MBH. We also examined the role of hypothalamic ATP-sensitive K(+) channels (K(ATP) channels) in the effects of leucine. Enhancing the metabolism of leucine acutely in the MBH lowered blood glucose through a biochemical network that was insensitive to rapamycin but strictly dependent on the hypothalamic metabolism of leucine to α-ketoisocaproic acid and, further, insensitive to acetyl- and malonyl-CoA. Functional K(ATP) channels were also required. Importantly, molecular attenuation of this central sensing mechanism in rats conferred susceptibility to developing hyperglycemia. We postulate that the metabolic sensing of leucine in the MBH is a previously unrecognized mechanism for the regulation of hepatic glucose production required to maintain glucose homeostasis.",,Ya Su;Tony K T Lam;Wu He;Alessandro Pocai;Joseph Bryan;Lydia Aguilar-Bryan;Roger Gutiérrez-Juárez

Its metabolic diversity and the ability to efficiently convert a wide range of compounds, including syngas (CO + H2) into acetyl-CoA have made this thermophilic bacterium a promising host for industrial biotechnology applications. However, lack of detailed information on M. thermoacetica's metabolism is a major impediment to its use as a microbial cell factory. In order to overcome this issue, a genome-scale constraint-based metabolic model of Moorella thermoacetica, iAI558, has been developed using its genome sequence and physiological data from published literature. The reconstructed metabolic network of M. thermoacetica comprises 558 metabolic genes, 705 biochemical reactions, and 698 metabolites. Of the total 705 model reactions, 680 are gene-associated while the rest are non-gene associated reactions. The model, in addition to simulating both autotrophic and heterotrophic growth of M. thermoacetica, revealed degeneracy in its TCA-cycle, a common characteristic of anaerobic metabolism. Furthermore, the model helped elucidate the poorly understood energy conservation mechanism of M. thermoacetica during autotrophy. Thus, in addition to generating experimentally testable hypotheses regarding its physiology, such a detailed model will facilitate rapid strain designing and metabolic engineering of M. thermoacetica for industrial applications.",,M Ahsanul Islam;Karsten Zengler;Elizabeth A Edwards;Radhakrishnan Mahadevan;Gregory Stephanopoulos

However, nothing is yet known about the genetic basis of dioxane metabolism. In this study, we used a microarray to study differential expression of genes in strain CB1190 grown on dioxane, glycolate (a previously identified intermediate of dioxane degradation), or pyruvate. Of eight multicomponent monooxygenase gene clusters carried by the strain CB1190 genome, only the monooxygenase gene cluster located on plasmid pPSED02 was upregulated with dioxane relative to pyruvate. Plasmid-borne genes for putative aldehyde dehydrogenases, an aldehyde reductase, and an alcohol oxidoreductase were also induced during growth with dioxane. With both dioxane and glycolate, a chromosomal gene cluster encoding a putative glycolate oxidase was upregulated, as were chromosomal genes related to glyoxylate metabolism through the glyoxylate carboligase pathway. Glyoxylate carboligase activity in cell extracts from cells pregrown with dioxane and in Rhodococcus jostii strain RHA1 cells expressing the putative strain CB1190 glyoxylate carboligase gene further demonstrated the role of glyoxylate metabolism in the degradation of dioxane. Finally, we used (13)C-labeled dioxane amino acid isotopomer analysis to provide additional evidence that metabolites of dioxane enter central metabolism as three-carbon compounds, likely as phosphoglycerate.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21185256/,Carbon metabolism and the sign of control coefficients in metabolic adaptations underlying K-ras transformation,"Metabolic adaptations are associated with changes in enzyme activities. These adaptations are characterized by patterns of positive and negative changes in metabolic fluxes and concentrations of intermediate metabolites. Knowledge of the mechanism and parameters governing enzyme kinetics is rarely available. However, the signs-increases or decreases-of many of these changes can be predicted using the signs of metabolic control coefficients. These signs require the only knowledge of the structure of the metabolic network and a limited qualitative knowledge of the regulatory dependences, which is widely available for carbon metabolism. Here, as a case study, we identified control coefficients with fixed signs in order to predict the pattern of changes in key enzyme activities which can explain the observed changes in fluxes and concentrations underlying the metabolic adaptations in oncogenic K-ras transformation in NIH-3T3 cells. The fixed signs of control coefficients indicate that metabolic changes following the oncogenic transformation-increased glycolysis and oxidative branch of the pentose-phosphate pathway, and decreased concentration in sugar-phosphates-could be associated with increases in activity for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, and decrease for transketolase. These predictions were validated experimentally by measuring specific activities. We conclude that predictions based on fixed signs of control coefficients are a very robust tool for the identification of changes in enzyme activities that can explain observed metabolic adaptations in carbon metabolism.",,Pedro de Atauri;Adrian Benito;Pedro Vizán;Miriam Zanuy;Ramón Mangues;Silvia Marín;Marta Cascante
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31691304/,Inborn errors of metabolite repair,"It is traditionally assumed that enzymes of intermediary metabolism are extremely specific and that this is sufficient to prevent the production of useless and/or toxic side-products. Recent work indicates that this statement is not entirely correct. In reality, enzymes are not strictly specific, they often display weak side activities on intracellular metabolites (substrate promiscuity) that resemble their physiological substrate or slowly catalyse abnormal reactions on their physiological substrate (catalytic promiscuity). They thereby produce non-classical metabolites that are not efficiently metabolised by conventional enzymes. In an increasing number of cases, metabolite repair enzymes are being discovered that serve to eliminate these non-classical metabolites and prevent their accumulation. Metabolite repair enzymes also eliminate non-classical metabolites that are formed through spontaneous (ie, not enzyme-catalysed) reactions. Importantly, genetic deficiencies in several metabolite repair enzymes lead to 'inborn errors of metabolite repair', such as L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, 'ubiquitous glucose-6-phosphatase' (G6PC3) deficiency, the neutropenia present in Glycogen Storage Disease type Ib or defects in the enzymes that repair the hydrated forms of NADH or NADPH. Metabolite repair defects may be difficult to identify as such, because the mutated enzymes are non-classical enzymes that act on non-classical metabolites, which in some cases accumulate only inside the cells, and at rather low, yet toxic, concentrations. It is therefore likely that many additional metabolite repair enzymes remain to be discovered and that many diseases of metabolite repair still await elucidation.","1,5-anhydroglucitol-6-phosphate; D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria; G6PC3; G6PT; NADP(H)X; PGM1; SGLT2 inhibitor; UGP2; enzyme promiscuity; galactose; inborn errors of metabolism; metabolite repair; neutropenia.",Maria Veiga-da-Cunha;Emile Van Schaftingen;Guido T Bommer

One week after dosing, 88.4 to 93.8% (mean 91.1%) of the administered radioactivity was excreted: 77.1 to 87.1% (mean 79.6%) in urine and 6.8 to 14.4% (mean 11.4%) in the feces. Paliperidone was the major circulating compound (97% of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve at 24 h). No metabolites could be detected in plasma. Renal excretion was the major route of elimination with 59% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine. About half of the renal excretion occurred by active secretion. Unchanged drug was not detected in feces. Four metabolic pathways were identified as being involved in the elimination of paliperidone, each of which accounted for up to a maximum of 6.5% of the biotransformation of the total dose. Biotransformation of the drug occurred through oxidative N-dealkylation (formation of the acid metabolite M1), monohydroxylation of the alicyclic ring (M9), alcohol dehydrogenation (formation of the ketone metabolite M12), and benzisoxazole scission (formation of M11), the latter in combination with glucuronidation (M16) or alicyclic hydroxylation (M10). Unchanged drug, M1, M9, M12, and M16 were detected in urine; M10 and M11 were detected in feces. The monohydroxylated metabolite M9 was solely present in urine samples of extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers, whereas M10, another metabolite monohydroxylated at the alicyclic ring system, was present in feces of poor metabolizers as well.

This review aims to summarize and compare the central carbohydrate metabolic and amino acid biosynthetic pathways of a selected group of streptococcal species, all belonging to the naso-oropharyngeal microbiome in humans and/or animals.

The models which are fundamentally based on the steady-state assumption are comparatively easy to construct and can be applied to networks up to genome scale. Fluxes are inherent variables in stoichiometric models and linear optimization can be used to identify intracellular flux distributions. Great caution, however, has to be paid to the selection of the specific objective function which inevitably implies the existence of a specific global cellular rationale.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32654530/,"Alternative carbohydrate pathways - enzymes, functions and engineering","Metabolic engineering is crucial in the development of production strains for platform chemicals, pharmaceuticals and biomaterials from renewable resources. The central carbon metabolism (CCM) of heterotrophs plays an essential role in the conversion of biomass to the cellular building blocks required for growth. Yet, engineering the CCM ultimately aims toward a maximization of flux toward products of interest. The most abundant dissimilative carbohydrate pathways amongst prokaryotes (and eukaryotes) are the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) and the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathways, which build the basics for heterotrophic metabolic chassis strains. Although the EMP is regarded as the textbook example of a carbohydrate pathway owing to its central role in production strains like Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Bacillus subtilis, it is either modified, complemented or even replaced by alternative carbohydrate pathways in different organisms. The ED pathway also plays key roles in biotechnological relevant bacteria, like Zymomonas mobilis and Pseudomonas putida, and its importance was recently discovered in photoautotrophs and marine microorganisms. In contrast to the EMP, the ED pathway and its variations are not evolutionary optimized for high ATP production and it differs in key principles such as protein cost, energetics and thermodynamics, which can be exploited in the construction of unique metabolic designs. Single ED pathway enzymes and complete ED pathway modules have been used to rewire carbon metabolisms in production strains and for the construction of cell-free enzymatic pathways. This review focuses on the differences of the ED and EMP pathways including their variations and discusses the use of alternative pathway strategies for in vivo and cell-free metabolic engineering.",Carbon metabolism; Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway; Entner-Doudoroff pathway; cell-free metabolic engineering; cofactors; metabolic engineering; thermodynamics.,Dominik Kopp;Anwar Sunna

To harness the capabilities of these organisms, we need a comprehensive systems-level understanding of their metabolism, which can be fundamentally achieved through large-scale mechanistic models of metabolism. In this study, we present a revised and significantly improved genome-scale metabolic model for the widely-studied microalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The model, iCre1355, represents a major advance over previous models, both in content and predictive power. iCre1355 encompasses a broad range of metabolic functions encoded across the nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes accounting for 1355 genes (1460 transcripts), 2394 and 1133 metabolites. We found improved performance over the previous metabolic model based on comparisons of predictive accuracy across 306 phenotypes (from 81 mutants), lipid yield analysis and growth rates derived from chemostat-grown cells (under three conditions). Measurement of macronutrient uptake revealed carbon and phosphate to be good predictors of growth rate, while nitrogen consumption appeared to be in excess. We analyzed high-resolution time series transcriptomics data using iCre1355 to uncover dynamic pathway-level changes that occur in response to nitrogen starvation and changes in light intensity. This approach enabled accurate prediction of growth rates, the cessation of growth and accumulation of triacylglycerols during nitrogen starvation, and the temporal response of different growth-associated pathways to increased light intensity. Thus, iCre1355 represents an experimentally validated genome-scale reconstruction of C. reinhardtii metabolism that should serve as a useful resource for studying the metabolic processes of this and related microalgae.",Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; constraint-based analysis; flux balance analysis; lipid accumulation; metabolic modeling; photosynthesis; systems biology.,Saheed Imam;Sascha Schäuble;Jacob Valenzuela;Adrián López García de Lomana;Warren Carter;Nathan D Price;Nitin S Baliga

To gain insight into the versatile metabolism of this clade, we took a constraint-based approach and created a genome-scale metabolic model (iDsh827) of Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL12T. Our model is the first accounting for the energy demand of motility, the light-driven ATP generation and experimentally determined specific biomass composition. To cover a large variety of environmental conditions, as well as plasmid and single gene knock-out mutants, we simulated 391,560 different physiological states using flux balance analysis. We analyzed our results with regard to energy metabolism, validated them experimentally, and revealed a pronounced metabolic response to the availability of light. Furthermore, we introduced the energy demand of motility as an important parameter in genome-scale metabolic models. The results of our simulations also gave insight into the changing usage of the two degradation routes for dimethylsulfoniopropionate, an abundant compound in the ocean. A side product of dimethylsulfoniopropionate degradation is dimethyl sulfide, which seeds cloud formation and thus enhances the reflection of sunlight. By our exhaustive simulations, we were able to identify single-gene knock-out mutants, which show an increased production of dimethyl sulfide. In addition to the single-gene knock-out simulations we studied the effect of plasmid loss on the metabolism.

In Aspergillus nidulans the AcuK and AcuM transcription factors regulate the expression of the gluconeogenic genes acuF, encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and acuG, encoding fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Expressed proteins containing the AcuK/AcuM N-terminal DNA-binding domains bind together in vitro to motifs containing repeats of CGG separated by seven bases (CCGN7CCG) and the functionality of these sequences was verified in vivo by acuF-lacZ reporter studies. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed inter-dependent DNA binding of the proteins to the promoters of gluconeogenic genes in vivo independent of the carbon source. Deletion of the mdhC gene encoding a cytoplasmic/peroxisomal malate dehydrogenase showed that this activity is not essential for gluconeogenesis and indicated that induction of AcuK/AcuM regulated genes might result from malate accumulation. Deletion of the gene for the alternative oxidase did not affect growth on gluconeogenic carbon sources; however, expression was absolutely dependent on AcuK and AcuM. Orthologues of AcuK and AcuM, are present in a wide range of fungal taxa and the CCGN7CCG motif is present in the 5' of many genes involved in gluconeogenesis indicating a fundamental role for these transcription factors in reprogramming fungal carbon metabolism.",,Yumi Suzuki;Sandra L Murray;Koon Ho Wong;Meryl A Davis;Michael J Hynes

Viruses actively reprogram host cell metabolism to establish optimal environment for their replication and spread. They stimulate the uptake of extracellular nutrients and predominantly modulate glucose, glutamine, and fatty acid metabolism to support anabolic metabolic pathways. Some viruses activate the process of aerobic glycolysis, divert the glycolytic carbon for biosynthetic reactions, and stimulate glutamine utilization to replenish tricarboxylic cycle intermediates. Others use glutamine carbon to promote de novo fatty acid synthesis, amino acid supply or glutathione production.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19321800/,Metabolic transformation in cancer,"In 2000, Douglas Hanahan and Robert Weinberg published a review detailing the six hallmarks of cancer. These are six phenotypes that a tumour requires in order to become a fully fledged malignancy: persistent growth signals, evasion of apoptosis, insensitivity to anti-growth signals, unlimited replicative potential, angiogenesis and invasion and metastasis. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that these phenotypes do not portray the whole story and that other hallmarks are necessary: one of which is a shift in cellular metabolism. The tumour environment creates a unique collection of stresses to which cells must adapt in order to survive. This environment is formed by the uncontrolled proliferation of cells, which ignore the cues that would create normal tissue architecture. As a result, the cells forming the tumour are exposed to low oxygen and nutrient levels, as well as high levels of toxic cellular waste products, which is thought to propel cells towards a more transformed phenotype, resistant to cell death and pro-metastatic.",,Daniel A Tennant;Raúl V Durán;Houda Boulahbel;Eyal Gottlieb

In contrast, P. methanolica grew well on glucose medium containing 5% methanol, but the growth defects reappeared on glucose medium supplemented with 5 mM formaldehyde. During methanol growth of P. methanolica, formaldehyde accumulated in the medium up to 0.3 mM before it was consumed rapidly based on cell growth. These findings indicate that the growth defect of P. methanolica on high methanol media is not caused directly by methanol toxicity, but rather by formaldehyde, which is a key toxic intermediate of methanol metabolism. Moreover, during methanol growth of P. methanolica, expression of enzymes in the methanol-oxidation pathway were induced before the alcohol oxidase isozymes Mod1p and Mod2p, and Mod1p expression was induced before Mod2p. These results suggest that to avoid excess accumulation of formaldehyde-the toxic intermediate of methanol metabolism-P. methanolica grown on methanol strictly regulates the order in which methanol-metabolizing enzymes are expressed.",Alcohol oxidase isozymes; Formaldehyde; Methanol metabolic enzymes; Methylotrophic yeast; Pichia methanolica.,Keishi Wakayama;Sakiko Yamaguchi;Akihito Takeuchi;Tasuku Mizumura;Shotaro Ozawa;Noboru Tomizuka;Takashi Hayakawa;Tomoyuki Nakagawa

Fermentation in C. reinhardtii is facilitated by a network of three predominant pathways producing four major byproducts: formate, ethanol, acetate and hydrogen.

For example, hybrid cluster protein 4 (HCP4) was found to be one of the most highly up-regulated genes under anoxic conditions. Hybrid cluster proteins have long been studied for their unique spectroscopic properties, yet their biological functions remain largely unclear. To probe its role during anaerobiosis, HCP4 was silenced using artificial microRNAs (ami-hcp4) followed by extensive phenotypic analyses of cells grown under anoxic conditions. Both the expression of key fermentative enzymes and their respective metabolites were significantly altered in ami-hcp4, with nitrogen uptake from the media also being significantly different than wild-type cells.

Tomato is also considered as an excellent model organism for studying the development and metabolism of fleshy fruits. However, the growth, yield and fruit quality of tomatoes can be affected by drought stress, a common abiotic stress for tomato. To investigate the potential metabolic response of tomato plants to drought, we reconstructed iHY3410, a genome-scale metabolic model of tomato leaf, and used this metabolic network to simulate tomato leaf metabolism. The resulting model includes 3410 genes and 2143 biochemical and transport reactions distributed across five intracellular organelles including cytosol, plastid, mitochondrion, peroxisome and vacuole. The model successfully described the known metabolic behaviour of tomato leaf under heterotrophic and phototrophic conditions. The in silico investigation of the metabolic characteristics for photorespiration and other relevant metabolic processes under drought stress suggested that: (i) the flux distributions through the mevalonate (MVA) pathway under drought were distinct from that under normal conditions; and (ii) the changes in fluxes through core metabolic pathways with varying flux ratio of RubisCO carboxylase to oxygenase may contribute to the adaptive stress response of plants. In addition, we improved on previous studies of reaction essentiality analysis for leaf metabolism by including potential alternative routes for compensating reaction knockouts.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23269558/,The remarkable pliability and promiscuity of specialized metabolism,"Metabolic pathways are often considered ""perfected"" or at least predictable as substrates efficiently rearrange into products through the intervention of an optimized enzyme. Moreover, single catalytic steps link up, forming a myriad of metabolic circuits that are often modeled with a high degree of certainty. However, on closer examination, most enzymes are not precise with respect to their activity, using not just one substrate but often a variety and producing not just one product but a diversity. Hence, the metabolic systems assembled from enzymes possessing varying degrees of what can be termed catalytic promiscuity are not clear-cut and restrictive; rather, they may at times operate stochastically in the intracellular milieu. This ""messiness"" complicates our understanding of normal and aberrant cellular behavior, while paradoxically sowing the seeds for future advantageous metabolic adaptations for host organisms. Catalytic promiscuity is intrinsically associated with the dynamic nature of enzyme structures and their chemical mechanisms, both key to enzyme and metabolic evolvability. In addition to primary (core) metabolism, which is essential for survival, organisms also possess highly elaborated secondary (specialized) metabolic systems. These specialized enzymes and pathways often provide unique adaptive strategies for a myriad of organisms and their populations in challenging and changing ecosystems. Generally, enzymes of specialized metabolism show attenuated kinetic activities and expanded catalytic promiscuity compared with their phylogenetic relatives rooted in primary metabolism. We propose that evolvability may be a selected trait in many specialized metabolic systems spread across populations of organisms exposed to continually fluctuating biotic and abiotic environmental pressures. As minor metabolites arising from catalytic messiness provided enhanced population fitness, specificity relaxed, and catalytic efficiency was attenuated.

The design process of the ""cell factory"" follows the following guidelines: 1) Construct an optimal synthetic route from raw materials to products; 2) Balance the metabolic flux of each reaction in the metabolic pathway, so that the metabolic flux of this pathway is much higher than the primary metabolism of the cells; 3) Precursor supply in the pathway should be sufficient, and adjust multiple precursors supply ratio as needed; 4) enzymatic reactions often involve the participation of various cofactors, smooth metabolic pathways need to balance or regenerate various cofactors; 5) Through genetic modification or process improvement to remove metabolic intermediates and products feedback inhibition to achieve higher yields.",,Bo Liu;Yong Tao

PCC 6803 under different trophic conditions,"Cyanobacteria have received considerable attention as a sustainable energy resource because of their organic material production capacity using light energy and CO2 as a carbon source. Therefore, it is important to understand the cellular metabolism of cyanobacteria for metabolic engineering. In this study, to shed light on the central metabolism of cyanobacteria, we performed transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of a glucose-tolerant strain of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, which was cultured under auto- and mixotrophic conditions. Our results indicate that the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis are activated under mixotrophic conditions rather than autotrophic conditions. Moreover, we examined the effect of atrazine, a photosynthesis inhibitor, on the metabolism of PCC 6803 under mixotrophic conditions, which was defined as photoheterotrophic conditions, by transcriptomics and metabolomics. We demonstrated that the activity of the glycolytic pathway decreased due to the indirect effect of atrazine. In addition, the difference in transcriptional and metabolic changes between auto- and photoheterotrophic conditions could also be captured.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25186110/,Acute effects of β-naphthoflavone on cardiorespiratory function and metabolism in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio),"Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists are known to cause lethal cardiovascular deformities in fish after developmental exposure. Acute adult fish toxicity of AhR agonists is thought to be minimal, but limited evidence suggests sublethal effects may also involve the cardiac system in fish. In the present study, adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were aqueously exposed to solvent control or three nominal concentrations of the commonly used model AhR agonist, β-naphthoflavone (BNF), for 48 h. Following exposure, fish were subjected to echocardiography to determine cardiac function or swimming tests with concurrent oxygen consumption measurement. Critical swimming speed and standard metabolic rate were not significantly changed, while active metabolic rate decreased with increasing BNF exposure, reaching statistical significance at the highest BNF exposure. Factorial aerobic scope was the most sensitive end-point and was decreased at even lower BNF concentrations, indicating a reduced aerobic capacity after acute AhR agonist exposure in adult fish. The highest BNF concentration caused a significant decrease in cardiac output, while increasing the ratio of atrial to ventricular heart rate (indicating atrioventricular conduction blockade). In conclusion, the effect of acute BNF exposure on zebrafish metabolic capacity and cardiac function is likely to be physiologically important given that fish have a critical need for adequate oxygen to fuel essential survival behaviors such as swimming, growth, and reproduction. Future studies should be directed at examining the effects of other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on fish cardiorespiratory function to determine whether their effects and modes of action are similar to BNF.",,Courtney J Gerger;Jith K Thomas;David M Janz;Lynn P Weber

Their main physiological function is aiding the digestion of lipophilic nutrients in intestinal tracts of vertebrates. Many bacteria are capable of transforming and degrading bile salts in the digestive tract and in the environment. Bacterial bile salt transformation and degradation is of high ecological relevance and also essential for the biotechnological production of steroid drugs. While biotechnological aspects have been reviewed many times, the physiological, biochemical and genetic aspects of bacterial bile salt transformation have been neglected. This review provides an overview of the reaction sequence of bile salt degradation and on the respective enzymes and genes exemplified with the degradation pathway of the bile salt cholate. The physiological adaptations for coping with the toxic effects of bile salts, recent biotechnological applications and ecological aspects of bacterial bile salt metabolism are also addressed. As the pathway for bile salt degradation merges with metabolic pathways for bacterial transformation of other steroids, such as testosterone and cholesterol, this review provides helpful background information for metabolic engineering of steroid-transforming bacteria in general.",,Bodo Philipp

Analyzing the metabolic adaptation toward environmental stress conditions improves our understanding of its pathophysiology and its dependency on host-derived nutrients. In this study, extra- and intracellular metabolic profiles were evaluated to investigate the impact of antimicrobial compounds targeting different pathways of the metabolome of S. pneumoniae TIGR4Δcps. For the metabolomics approach, we analyzed the complex variety of metabolites by using 1H NMR, HPLC-MS, and GC-MS as different analytical techniques. Through this combination, we detected nearly 120 metabolites. For each antimicrobial compound, individual metabolic effects were detected that often comprised global biosynthetic pathways. Cefotaxime altered amino acids metabolism and carbon metabolism. The purine and pyrimidine metabolic pathways were mostly affected by moxifloxacin treatment. The combination of cefotaxime and azithromycin intensified the stress response compared with the use of the single antibiotic. However, we observed that three cell wall metabolites were altered only by treatment with the combination of the two antibiotics. Only moxifloxacin stress-induced alternation in CDP-ribitol concentration. Teixobactin-Arg10 resulted in global changes of pneumococcal metabolism.

Here, we evaluated the biconnectivity of the metabolic networks of 506 species in terms of the clustering coefficients and the largest biconnected components (LBCs), wherein a biconnected component (BC) indicates a set of nodes in which every pair is connected by more than one path. Via comparison with the rewired networks, we illustrated how biconnectivity in cellular metabolism is achieved on small and large scales. Defining the biconnectivity of individual metabolic compounds by counting the number of species in which the compound belonged to the LBC, we demonstrated that biconnectivity is significantly correlated with the evolutionary age and functional importance of a compound. The prevalence of diseases associated with each metabolic compound quantifies the compounds vulnerability, i.e., the likelihood that it will cause a metabolic disorder. Moreover, the vulnerability depends on both the biconnectivity and the lethality of the compound. This fact can be used in drug discovery and medical treatments.",,P Kim;D-S Lee;B Kahng

To address these issues, a method of metabonomics based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to identify some crucial biomarkers and transcription levels of the enzymes in seminal fluid. Seminal fluid samples were collected from 87 AS patients and 73 healthy males with normozoospermia. The quantitative analysis by UPLC-MS/MS showed that 19 metabolites in seminal plasma were associated with AS, and they were involved in several metabolic pathways, such as energy metabolism, purine metabolism, methionine cycle, and branched chain amino acid metabolism. Among these metabolites, the levels of citric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, and pyruvic acid, which are related to energy metabolism, were collectively reduced in the AS group, whereas the lactic acid level was enhanced. These results indicated that lesser energy source (adenosine triphosphate) was produced through the anaerobic glycolysis pathway rather than via aerobic catabolism of suger and tricarboxylic acid cycle, resulting in reduced power of sperms. Meanwhile, partial least squares discriminant analysis showed significant differences in metabolic profiles between the AS and control groups. In addition, RT-qPCR results revealed that the expression levels of four genes encoding fructokinase citrate synthase, succinate dehydrogenase, and spermine synthase, which were related to energy metabolism, were decreased in the AS group. The 23 descriptors with differential expression in AS may be valuable for the diagnosis and sequential study on AS. These results will help highlight the role of sperm inactivity in AS pathogenesis.",RT-qPCR; UPLC-MS/MS; asthenozoospermia; seminal fluid; tricarboxylic acid.,Lianguo Chen;Chao-Wei Wen;Ming-Jie Deng;Ping-Li;Zhi-Da Zhang;Zhuo-Hua Zhou;Xianqin Wang

Cancer networks have been identified as scale-free networks and may contain a functionally important key player called a hub that is linked to a large number of interactors. Since a hub can serve as a biological marker in a given network, targeting the hub could be an effective strategy for enhancing the efficacy of cancer treatment. Chemotherapies and radiotherapies are generally used to treat tumors not amenable to resection, and target single or multiple molecules associated with hubs. However, these therapies may unexpectedly induce the resistance of cancer cells to drugs and radiation. Cancer cells can overcome therapy-induced damage via the activation of back-up signaling pathways and flexible modulation of affected networks. These activities are considered to be the main reasons for chemoresistance and radioresistance, and subsequent failure of cancer therapies. Much effort is required to identify the key molecules that control the modulation of signaling networks in response to drugs and radiation. Network-based therapy that affects network flexibility, including rewired network structures and hub molecules in these networks, could minimize the occurrence of side-effects and be a promising strategy for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of cancer treatments.

In this review, we present the combined efforts made during the past 15 years to engineer stilbene metabolic pathways in microbial cells, mainly the Saccharomyces cerevisiae baker yeast, the Escherichia coli and the Corynebacterium glutamicum bacteria. Rationalized approaches to the heterologous expression of the partial or the entire stilbene biosynthetic routes are presented to allow the identification and/or bypassing of the major bottlenecks in the endogenous microbial cell metabolism as well as potential regulations of the genes involved in these metabolic pathways. The contributions of bioinformatics to synthetic biology are developed to highlight their tremendous help in predicting which target genes are likely to be up-regulated or deleted for controlling the dynamics of precursor flows in the tailored microbial cells. Further insight is given to the metabolic engineering of microbial cells with ""decorating"" enzymes, such as methyl and glycosyltransferases or hydroxylases, which can act sequentially on the stilbene core structure.

Accelerated glucose uptake during anaerobic glycolysis and loss of regulation between glycolytic metabolism and respiration, are the major metabolic changes found in malignant cells. The non-metabolizable glucose analog, 2-deoxy-D-glucose inhibits glucose synthesis and adenosine triphosphate production. The adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key sensor of cellular energy and AMPK is a potential target for cancer prevention and/or treatment. Metformin is an activator of AMPK which inhibits protein synthesis and gluconeogenesis during cellular stress.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26926807/,Structural biology and regulation of the plant sulfation pathway,"In plants, sulfur is an essential nutrient that must be converted into usable metabolic forms for the formation of sulfur-containing amino acids and peptides (primary route) and for the modification of diverse metabolites (secondary route). In plants, the fate of assimilated sulfate depends on the three enzymes - ATP sulfurylase, adenosine-5'-phosphate (APS) reductase, and APS kinase - that form a branchpoint in the pathway. ATP sulfurylase catalyzes the formation of the critical intermediate APS, which can either be used in the primary assimilatory route or be phosphorylated to 3'-phospho-APS (PAPS) for a variety of sulfation reactions. Recent biochemical and structural studies of the branchpoint enzymes in plant sulfur metabolism suggest that redox-regulation may control sulfur partitioning between primary and secondary routes. Disulfide-based redox switches differentially affect APS reductase and APS kinase. Oxidative conditions that promote disulfide formation increase the activity of APS reductase and decreases PAPS production by APS kinase. Here we review recent work on the ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase from plants that provide new insight on the regulation of PAPS formation, the structural evolution of these enzymes in different organisms, and redox-control of this key branchpoint in plant sulfur metabolism.",Crystallography; Enzyme kinetics; Plant sulfur metabolisms; Protein structure; Sulfation pathways; X-ray.,Joseph M Jez;Geoffrey E Ravilious;Jonathan Herrmann

However, it now becomes clear that it is not so simple, because the photosynthetic response to gaseous conditions involves 'ancillary' metabolisms, even in the short-term.

Angiotensin II (Ang II), potassium (K(+)) and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) are the main physiological agonists which regulate aldosterone secretion. Aldosterone production is regulated within minutes of stimulation (acutely) through increased expression and phosphorylation of the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein and over hours to days (chronically) by increased expression of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of aldosterone, particularly CYP11B2.

To discover such indicators and the underlying mechanisms of toxicity, we used gentamicin as an exemplar kidney toxicant and performed systematic perturbation studies in Sprague Dawley rats. We obtained high-throughput data 7 and 13 h after administration of a single dose of gentamicin (0.5 g/kg) and identified global changes in genes in the liver and kidneys, metabolites in the plasma and urine, and absolute fluxes in central carbon metabolism. We used these measured changes in genes in the liver and kidney as constraints to a rat multitissue genome-scale metabolic network model to investigate the mechanism of gentamicin-induced kidney toxicity and identify metabolites associated with changes in tissue gene expression. Our experimental analysis revealed that gentamicin-induced metabolic perturbations could be detected as early as 7 h postexposure. Our integrated systems-level analyses suggest that changes in kidney gene expression drive most of the significant metabolite alterations in the urine. The analyses thus allowed us to identify several significantly enriched injury-specific pathways in the kidney underlying gentamicin-induced toxicity, as well as metabolites in these pathways that could serve as potential early indicators of kidney damage.",aminoaciduria; biomarkers; genome-scale models; gentamicin; metabolic pathways; urine.,Venkat R Pannala;Kalyan C Vinnakota;Shanea K Estes;Irina Trenary;Tracy P OˈBrien;Richard L Printz;Jason A Papin;Jaques Reifman;Tatsuya Oyama;Masakazu Shiota;Jamey D Young;Anders Wallqvist

Metabolic engineering is traditionally based on combining existing enzymes to give new, or modified, pathways, within a new context and/or organism.

We discuss the differences between enzymes in central versus specialized, or secondary metabolism and highlight unique features of specialized metabolism enzymes participating in the synthesis of natural products. We argue that, for the purpose of metabolic engineering, the catalytic efficiency and selectivity of many enzymes can be improved with the aim of achieving higher rates, yields and product purities.

Nevertheless, recent studies have defined regulatory mechanisms and transcriptional targets of ERRalpha, allowing this receptor to join ranks with other nuclear receptors that control metabolism. Notably, mice lacking ERRalpha show defects when challenged with stressors that require a 'shift of gears' in energy metabolism, such as exposure to cold, cardiac overload or infection.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23614721/,Metabolic plasticity for isoprenoid biosynthesis in bacteria,"Isoprenoids are a large family of compounds synthesized by all free-living organisms. In most bacteria, the common precursors of all isoprenoids are produced by the MEP (methylerythritol 4-phosphate) pathway. The MEP pathway is absent from archaea, fungi and animals (including humans), which synthesize their isoprenoid precursors using the completely unrelated MVA (mevalonate) pathway. Because the MEP pathway is essential in most bacterial pathogens (as well as in the malaria parasites), it has been proposed as a promising new target for the development of novel anti-infective agents. However, bacteria show a remarkable plasticity for isoprenoid biosynthesis that should be taken into account when targeting this metabolic pathway for the development of new antibiotics. For example, a few bacteria use the MVA pathway instead of the MEP pathway, whereas others possess the two full pathways, and some parasitic strains lack both the MVA and the MEP pathways (probably because they obtain their isoprenoids from host cells). Moreover, alternative enzymes and metabolic intermediates to those of the canonical MVA or MEP pathways exist in some organisms. Recent work has also shown that resistance to a block of the first steps of the MEP pathway can easily be developed because several enzymes unrelated to isoprenoid biosynthesis can produce pathway intermediates upon spontaneous mutations. In the present review, we discuss the major advances in our knowledge of the biochemical toolbox exploited by bacteria to synthesize the universal precursors for their essential isoprenoids.",,Jordi Pérez-Gil;Manuel Rodríguez-Concepción
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25631681/,"Fluxes through plant metabolic networks: measurements, predictions, insights and challenges","Although the flows of material through metabolic networks are central to cell function, they are not easy to measure other than at the level of inputs and outputs. This is particularly true in plant cells, where the network spans multiple subcellular compartments and where the network may function either heterotrophically or photoautotrophically. For many years, kinetic modelling of pathways provided the only method for describing the operation of fragments of the network. However, more recently, it has become possible to map the fluxes in central carbon metabolism using the stable isotope labelling techniques of metabolic flux analysis (MFA), and to predict intracellular fluxes using constraints-based modelling procedures such as flux balance analysis (FBA). These approaches were originally developed for the analysis of microbial metabolism, but over the last decade, they have been adapted for the more demanding analysis of plant metabolic networks. Here, the principal features of MFA and FBA as applied to plants are outlined, followed by a discussion of the insights that have been gained into plant metabolic networks through the application of these time-consuming and non-trivial methods. The discussion focuses on how a system-wide view of plant metabolism has increased our understanding of network structure, metabolic perturbations and the provision of reducing power and energy for cell function.

Using a large-scale two-dimensional (2-D) protein gel electrophoresis approach, we analyzed the adaptation mechanisms to nutrient limitation in a batch culture in complex medium with glucose as carbon source. To this end, we constructed a 2-D reference map of cytoplasmic proteins and quantitatively compared protein accumulation of growing yeast cells with those from the stationary phase. This yielded characteristic proteome signatures for each physiological state. During exponential growth, proteins required for the synthesis of RNA, DNA, and proteins, including components of purine and pyrimidine synthesis pathways and ribosomal proteins, were over-represented. The stationary-phase signature revealed a complex reprogramming of metabolic networks: Up-regulation of glyoxylate cycle, gluconeogenesis, and glutamate degradation signaled a switch to the utilization of alternative carbon sources instead of the exhausted glucose.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22475271/,Disposition and interaction of biotherapeutics in pediatric populations,"Human development of an individual from a fertilized ovum to maturity alters the body anatomy and physiology. Changes of size and function, from birth onwards, cause significant alterations in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of drugs and subsequently their response pharmacodynamics (PD) in infants and children from those in adults. During the last three decades, hundreds of mechanistic and clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted to investigate the age-mediated changes of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion processes of drugs, which subsequently affect the pharmacology response and the safety in pediatric patients compared to adults. The practice of determining pediatric dose based on simplistic scaling of an adult dose assuming linear relationship between postnatal age and body weight or surface area that may lead to under prediction of therapeutic dose or over prediction of the dose is now under scrutiny. By understanding the disposition mechanism of therapeutic agents thoroughly, their potential drug interactions and their PK/PD relationships can be better determined in pediatric populations. As such, dosing regimens can be estimated based on actual clearance and exposure and not just by simplistic scaling of an adult dose. Accurate prediction of clearance in pediatrics is so critical that extensive translational research is warranted to improve our ability to estimate safe and efficacious doses in different pediatric populations from retrospective clinical studies in adults. Biotherapeutics, proteins and peptides-based drugs, generally depend on absorption (A), distribution (D), metabolism (M), and excretion (E) in their disposition as small molecules, but the underlying mechanisms and potential drug interaction propensity can be very different. In this article, the factors that alter pediatric and adult PK parameters are compared, and pediatric and adult PK parameters and potential drug interactions for selected biotherapeutics are summarized. Moreover, challenges of studying therapeutic proteins and peptides in pediatrics are discussed.",,Souzan Yanni
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33438829/,Metabolic energy conservation for fermentative product formation,"Microbial production of bulk chemicals and biofuels from carbohydrates competes with low-cost fossil-based production. To limit production costs, high titres, productivities and especially high yields are required. This necessitates metabolic networks involved in product formation to be redox-neutral and conserve metabolic energy to sustain growth and maintenance. Here, we review the mechanisms available to conserve energy and to prevent unnecessary energy expenditure. First, an overview of ATP production in existing sugar-based fermentation processes is presented. Substrate-level phosphorylation (SLP) and the involved kinase reactions are described. Based on the thermodynamics of these reactions, we explore whether other kinase-catalysed reactions can be applied for SLP. Generation of ion-motive force is another means to conserve metabolic energy. We provide examples how its generation is supported by carbon-carbon double bond reduction, decarboxylation and electron transfer between redox cofactors. In a wider perspective, the relationship between redox potential and energy conservation is discussed. We describe how the energy input required for coenzyme A (CoA) and CO2 binding can be reduced by applying CoA-transferases and transcarboxylases. The transport of sugars and fermentation products may require metabolic energy input, but alternative transport systems can be used to minimize this. Finally, we show that energy contained in glycosidic bonds and the phosphate-phosphate bond of pyrophosphate can be conserved. This review can be used as a reference to design energetically efficient microbial cell factories and enhance product yield.",,Pauline L Folch;Markus M M Bisschops;Ruud A Weusthuis

Biohydrogen has several potential advantages over other biofuels. Dark fermentation as a means of producing biohydrogen is attractive since a variety of readily available waste streams can be used. However, at present its practical application is prevented by the low yields obtained. Here the basic metabolisms leading to hydrogen production are outlined and current research to increase yields, either through modification of existing pathways, or by metabolic engineering to create new, higher yielding, pathways, is discussed. Inactivation of competing reactions and manipulation of culture conditions has lead to higher hydrogen yields, near those predicted by metabolic schemes. However, to be useful, hydrogen production must be increased beyond present limits. Several possibilities for surpassing those limits using metabolic engineering are presented.",,Patrick C Hallenbeck;Dipankar Ghosh

Central metabolic pathways are under the control of signalling pathways and, vice versa, the cellular metabolic profile influences cell signalling through the incorporation of various metabolic sensors into the signalling networks. Thus information about nutrients availability directly and crucially influences crucial cell decisions. In the present review, I summarize our current knowledge of various metabolic sensors and give some examples of the integration of metabolically derived inputs into the signalling system and the regulation of transcription. I also discuss the Warburg effect where the cross-talk between metabolism and signalling is used to orchestrate rapid cell growth and division.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23080250/,Metabolic reprogramming under microaerobic and anaerobic conditions in bacteria,"Oxygen has a great impact on the metabolism and physiology of microorganisms. It serves as the most efficient terminal electron acceptor to drive the energy conservation process of cellular respiration and is required in many biosynthetic reactions. Bacteria encounter oxygen fluctuation and limitation during their growth in both natural ecological niches and in laboratory vessels. In response to oxygen limitation, facultative bacteria undergo substantial metabolic reprogramming to switch from the aerobic respiration to either anaerobic respiration, fermentation, or photosynthesis. Two key factors determine the metabolic pathways bacteria adopt under oxygen deprived microaerobic and anaerobic conditions: maximal energy conservation and redox homeostasis. In this chapter, we first describe how the fulfillment of these two key factors governs the metabolic reprogramming of facultative bacteria and how the process is tightly controlled by several global regulatory factors: FNR, ArcBA, as well as NarL and NarP. We then utilizes fermentation of glycerol, a large surplus byproduct of biodiesel industry, as an example to illustrate how environment, process, and strain based approaches can be exploited to manipulate and engineer the anaerobic metabolic pathways so that desirable fermentation products can be achieved with optimal yield.",,Yue Shan;Yong Lai;Aixin Yan

Its secondary metabolism is largely unknown except for the production of echinocandin B and sterigmatocystin. We constructed mutants for three genes that regulate secondary metabolism in A. pachycristatus NRRL 11440, and evaluated the secondary metabolites produced by wild type and mutants strains. The secondary metabolism was explored by metabolic networking of UPLC-HRMS/MS data. The genes and metabolites of A. pachycristatus were compared to those of A. nidulans FGSC A4 as a reference to identify compounds and link them to their encoding genes. Major differences in chromatographic profiles were observable among the mutants. At least 28 molecules were identified in crude extracts that corresponded to nine characterized gene clusters. Moreover, metabolic networking revealed the presence of a yet unexplored array of secondary metabolites, including several undescribed fellutamides derivatives. Comparative reference to its sister species, A. nidulans, was an efficient way to dereplicate known compounds, whereas metabolic networking provided information that allowed prioritization of unknown compounds for further metabolic exploration. The mutation of global regulator genes proved to be a useful tool for expanding the expression of metabolic diversity in A. pachycristatus.",Aspergillus pachycristatus; LaeA; global regulators; mcrA; metabolic networking; veA.,Bruno Perlatti;Nan Lan;Yongying Jiang;Zhiqiang An;Gerald Bills

However, despite rapid progress in this area, pathway modeling can become a real nightmare for researchers, notably when few experimental data are available or when the pathway is highly complex. Here, three different approaches were developed to model the second part of glycolysis of E. histolytica as an application example, and have succeeded in predicting the final pathway flux: one including detailed kinetic information (white-box), another with an added adjustment term (grey-box) and the last one using an artificial neural network method (black-box). Afterwards, each model was used for metabolic control analysis and flux control coefficient determination. The first two enzymes of this pathway are identified as the key enzymes playing a role in flux control.

Increasingly, the underlying aberrant metabolic pathways are being considered as novel targets for cancer therapy. Denoted ""metabolic targeting"", small molecule drugs are under investigation for focused inhibition of key metabolic steps that are utilized by tumors, since such inhibitors should harbor minimal toxicity towards surrounding normal tissues. This review will examine the primary biochemical pathways that tumors harness to enhance their bioenergetic capacity, which in turn, help their rapid proliferation and metastasis within the host. It is hoped that ""metabolite-mimetic"" drugs can be utilized to interfere with metabolic flux pathways active within the tumor, and across tumor-microenvironment boundary. In fact, the major pathways of mammalian metabolism, i.e., the carbohydrate, amino-acid, and fatty-acid metabolic pathways have been examined as putative targets for drug development, with some drug candidates advancing to phase II/III stages. In this regard, glucose metabolism, i.e., the glycolytic pathway - that predominates the bio-energetic flux in tumors, and the associated mitochondrial metabolism have received the most attention as suitable ""druggable"" targets, focused either at the pathway enzymes or at the plasma-membrane-bound metabolite transporters.

To do this, one needs to reduce the information, lists of chemical reactions, available in databases. Even for the simplest type of graph representation, this reduction can be done in several ways. We investigate different simple network representations by testing how well they encode information about one biologically important network structure-network modularity (the propensity for edges to be clustered into dense groups that are sparsely connected between each other). To achieve this goal, we design a model of reaction systems where network modularity can be controlled and measure how well the reduction to simple graphs captures the modular structure of the model reaction system. We find that the network types that best capture the modular structure of the reaction system are substrate-product networks (where substrates are linked to products of a reaction) and substance networks (with edges between all substances participating in a reaction). Furthermore, we argue that the proposed model for reaction systems with tunable clustering is a general framework for studies of how reaction systems are affected by modularity.

The reason is that static component concentrations, albeit extremely informative, do not contain functional information per se.

I argue here that intracellular reaction rates are the functional end points of these interactions in metabolic networks, hence are highly relevant for systems biology.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26767951/,L-Tryptophan-kynurenine pathway enzymes are therapeutic target for neuropsychiatric diseases: Focus on cell type differences,"The kynurenine pathway (KP) is the major route for tryptophan (TRP) metabolism in most mammalian tissues. The KP metabolizes TRP into a number of neuroactive metabolites, such as kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), and quinolinic acid (QUIN). Elevated metabolite concentrations in the central nervous system are associated with the pathophysiology of several inflammation-related neuropsychiatric diseases. During an inflammatory response, the initial KP metabolic step is primarily regulated by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), which produces KYN from TRP. Following this initial step, the KP has 2 distinct branches; one branch is regulated by kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) and is primarily responsible for the 3-HK and QUIN production, and the other branch is regulated by kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT), which produces KYNA, an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and alpha-7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. Unbalanced KP metabolism has been demonstrated in distinct neuropsychiatric diseases; thus, understanding the mechanisms that regulate KP enzyme expression and activity is important. These enzymes are expressed by specific cell types, and the induction of enzyme expression by inflammatory stimuli also shows cell type specificity. This review provides an overview and discusses the current understanding of the influence of KP enzyme expression and activity in different cell types on the pathophysiological mechanisms of specific neuropsychiatric diseases.

Nevertheless, little is known about the regulation of its metabolism in filamentous fungi. Lactose is metabolized slowly, and some important fungi such as A. niger cannot use it at all. A more detailed knowledge on the rate-limiting steps would be helpful to improve its industrial application. We have chosen A. nidulans as an object for investigating how lactose and galactose metabolism are regulated because it has long become a model system for biochemical and genetic research on fungi, and mutants in the lactose-metabolizing pathway of A. nidulans are available. In this paper, we will review the contributions of our research group achieved on this field.",,Erzsébet Fekete;János Padra;Attila Szentirmai;Levente Karaffa
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18728221/,Metabolic cycling in control of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion,"Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) is central to normal control of metabolic fuel homeostasis, and its impairment is a key element of beta-cell failure in type 2 diabetes. Glucose exerts its effects on insulin secretion via its metabolism in beta-cells to generate stimulus/secretion coupling factors, including a rise in the ATP/ADP ratio, which serves to suppress ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels and activate voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels, leading to stimulation of insulin granule exocytosis. Whereas this K(ATP) channel-dependent mechanism of GSIS has been broadly accepted for more than 30 years, it has become increasingly apparent that it does not fully describe the effects of glucose on insulin secretion. More recent studies have demonstrated an important role for cyclic pathways of pyruvate metabolism in control of insulin secretion. Three cycles occur in islet beta-cells: the pyruvate/malate, pyruvate/citrate, and pyruvate/isocitrate cycles. This review discusses recent work on the role of each of these pathways in control of insulin secretion and builds a case for the particular relevance of byproducts of the pyruvate/isocitrate cycle, NADPH and alpha-ketoglutarate, in control of GSIS.",,Mette V Jensen;Jamie W Joseph;Sarah M Ronnebaum;Shawn C Burgess;A Dean Sherry;Christopher B Newgard

Therefore, this cellular model is a unique tool that can be used to estimate biliary excretion of compounds. SCH have been used widely to assess hepatobiliary disposition of endogenous and exogenous compounds and metabolites. Mechanistic modeling based on SCH data enables estimation of metabolic and transporter-mediated clearances, which can be used to construct physiologically based pharmacokinetic models for prediction of drug disposition and drug-drug interactions in humans. In addition to pharmacokinetic studies, SCH also have been used to study cytotoxicity and perturbation of biological processes by drugs and hepatically generated metabolites. Human SCH can provide mechanistic insights underlying clinical drug-induced liver injury (DILI). In addition, data generated in SCH can be integrated into systems pharmacology models to predict potential DILI in humans. In this review, applications of SCH in studying hepatobiliary drug disposition and bile acid-mediated DILI are discussed. An example is presented to show how data generated in the SCH model were used to establish a quantitative relationship between intracellular bile acids and cytotoxicity, and how this information was incorporated into a systems pharmacology model for DILI prediction.",bile acid transporters; hepatic clearance; hepatobiliary disposition; mathematical models; sandwich-cultured hepatocytes (SCH); toxicity.,Kyunghee Yang;Cen Guo;Jeffrey L Woodhead;Robert L St Claire 3rd;Paul B Watkins;Scott Q Siler;Brett A Howell;Kim L R Brouwer

Viruses have evolved mechanisms to usurp the host's metabolic resources, funneling them towards the production of virion components as well as the organization of specialized compartments for replication, maturation, and dissemination. Consequently, hosts have developed a variety of metabolic countermeasures to sense and resist these viral changes.

By employing a variety of ubiquitin ligases to target specific cellular proteins, the ubiquitin-proteasome system controls physiological processes in a highly regulated fashion. Recent studies on a plant hormone auxin have unveiled a novel paradigm of signal transduction in which ubiquitin ligases function as hormone receptors. Perceived by the F-box protein subunit of the SCF(TIR1) ubiquitin ligase, auxin directly promotes the recruitment of a family of transcriptional repressors for ubiquitination, thereby activating extensive transcriptional programs. Structural studies have revealed that auxin functions through a ""molecular glue"" mechanism to enhance protein-protein interactions with the assistance of another small molecule cofactor, inositol hexakisphosphate. Given the extensive repertoire of similar ubiquitin ligases in eukaryotic cells, this novel and widely adopted hormone-signaling mechanism in plants may also exist in other organisms.",,Xu Tan;Ning Zheng

Considering the differences between life cycle phases driving the growth of this predator, growth-phase condition-specific models have been generated allowing the systematic study of its metabolic capabilities. Using these computational tools, we have been able to analyze, from a system level, the dynamic metabolism of the predatory bacteria as the life cycle progresses. We provide computational evidences supporting potential axenic growth of B. bacteriovorus's in a rich medium based on its encoded metabolic capabilities. Our systems-level analysis confirms the presence of ""energy-saving"" mechanisms in this predator as well as an abrupt metabolic shift between the attack and intraperiplasmic growth phases. Our results strongly suggest that predatory bacteria's metabolic networks have low robustness, likely hampering their ability to tackle drastic environmental fluctuations, thus being confined to stable and predictable habitats.

However, there has been limited success with the current approach where one or few candidate genes are examined for a limited number of allelic variants. A change in paradigm emerges from the availability of the HapMap, the wealth of data on less common genetic polymorphisms, and new genotyping technology. We present a comprehensive review of functional and putative functional variants in genes encoding absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) proteins relevant to HIV therapy.

Despite having reached the consensus that one important function of photorespiration is the removal of toxic metabolite intermediates, other possible functions have emerged, and others could well emerge in the future. As a primary metabolic pathway, photorespiration interacts with other routes; however the nature of these interactions is not well known. One of these interacting pathways could be the biosynthesis of serine, since this amino acid is synthesised through photorespiratory and non-photorespiratory routes. At present, the exact contribution of each route to serine supply in different tissues and organs, their biological significance and how pathways are integrated and/or regulated remain unknown.

However, the fossil-based economy increasingly reaches its limits and displays contradictions. Bioeconomy, strategically combining economy and ecology willing to make biobased and sustainable growth possible, is promising to make a significant contribution towards solving these issues. In this context, microbial bioconversions are promising to support partially the increasing need for materials and fuels starting from fresh, preferably waste, biomass. Butanol is a very attractive molecule finding applications both as a chemical platform and as a fuel. Today it principally derives from petroleum, but it also represents the final product of microbial catabolic pathways. Because of the need to maximize yield, titer and productivity to make the production competitive and viable, the challenge is to transform a robustly regulated metabolic network into the principal cellular activity. However, this goal can only be accomplished by a profound understanding of the cellular physiology, survival strategy and sensing/signalling cascades.

Besides, such models do not take into account all substrates for each reaction during the search, leading to solutions that lack biological feasibility in many cases.

Recently, there has been growing interest in investigating the potential role of CR as a treatment intervention for age-related diseases, such as cancer, because an increasing body of literature has demonstrated a metabolic component to both carcinogenesis and tumor progression. In fact, many of the molecular pathways that are altered with CR are also known to be altered in cancer. Therefore, manipulation of these pathways using CR can render cancer cells, and most notably breast cancer cells, more susceptible to standard cytotoxic treatment with radiation and chemotherapy.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23762991/,Towards a metabolic therapy of cancer?,"It is increasingly appreciated that cancer cells must be endowed with specific metabolic adaptations to support enhanced growth and to ensure survival under stressful conditions. On the other hand, many oncogenic mutations of protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes directly cause metabolic derangements and, conversely, mutations of enzymes have been found to underlie several forms of cancer. Thus, cancer-specific metabolic alterations are now considered among the hallmarks of malignant tumors. Most commonly, cancer cells exhibit enhanced glycolysis under aerobic conditions (the Warburg effect) but alterations in the metabolism of amino acids, such as glutamine, serine and proline are increasingly described as important metabolic features of selected tumor types. In theory, all these deranged cancer-specific metabolic pathways may constitute novel therapeutic targets, although the only ""metabolic"" drug in clinical use is still represented by the enzyme L-asparaginase.

In the extant biosphere the reductive pentose phosphate (Calvin-Benson) cycle is the predominant mechanism by which many prokaryotes and all plants fix CO(2) into biomass. However, the fact that five alternative autotrophic pathways exist in prokaryotes is often neglected. This bias may lead to serious misjudgments in models of the global carbon cycle, in hypotheses on the evolution of metabolism, and in interpretations of geological records. Here, I review these alternative pathways that differ fundamentally from the Calvin-Benson cycle. Revealingly, these five alternative pathways pivot on acetyl-coenzyme A, the turntable of metabolism, demanding a gluconeogenic pathway starting from acetyl-coenzyme A and CO(2). It appears that the formation of an activated acetic acid from inorganic carbon represents the initial step toward metabolism. Consequently, biosyntheses likely started from activated acetic acid and gluconeogenesis preceded glycolysis.",,Georg Fuchs

Such labelling information not only can provide novel insights into functional pathways but also can determine absolute carbon fluxes through the metabolic network via metabolic modelling approaches. This technique has been used for finding pathways that may have been mis-annotated in the past, elucidating new enzyme functions, and investigating cell metabolisms in microbial communities. In this review paper, we summarize the applications of (13)C approaches to analyse novel cell metabolisms for the past 3 years. The isotopic fingerprints (defined as unique isotopomers useful for pathway identifications) have revealed the operations of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle, new enzymes for biosynthesis of central metabolites, diverse respiration routes in phototrophic metabolism, co-metabolism of carbon nutrients and novel CO(2) fixation pathways. This review also discusses new isotopic methods to map carbon fluxes in global metabolisms, as well as potential factors influencing the metabolic flux quantification (e.g. metabolite channelling, the isotopic purity of (13)C substrates and the isotopic effect).

Metabolic activity (i.e. rates of flow, most commonly referred to as flux) is constrained by thermodynamics and regulated by the activity of enzymes. The general principles that relate biological and physical variables to metabolic control are incompletely understood. Using metabolic control analysis and computer simulations in several models of simplified metabolic pathways, we derive analytical expressions that define relationships between thermodynamics, enzyme activity, and flux control. The relationships are further analyzed in a mathematical model of glycolysis as an example of a complex biochemical pathway. We show that metabolic pathways that are very far from equilibrium are controlled by the activity of upstream enzymes. However, in general, regulation of metabolic fluxes by an enzyme has a more adaptable pattern, which relies more on distribution of free energy among reaction steps in the pathway than on the thermodynamic properties of the given enzyme.

A logical answer was the postulate of metabolic channeling, which in its simplest embodiment assumes that the product generated by one enzyme passes directly to a second without diffusion into the surrounding medium. This tight coupling of activities might increase a pathway's metabolic flux and/or serve to sequester unstable/toxic/reactive intermediates as well as prevent their access to other networks. Here, we present evidence for this concept, commencing with enzymes that feature a physical molecular tunnel, to multi-enzyme complexes that retain pathway substrates through electrostatics or enclosures, and finally to metabolons that feature collections of enzymes assembled into clusters with variable stoichiometric composition. Lastly, we discuss the advantages of reversibly assembled metabolons in the context of the purinosome, the purine biosynthesis metabolon.",membrane-less compartmentalization; metabolic channeling; metabolon; molecular tunnel; purinosome.,Vidhi Pareek;Zhou Sha;Jingxuan He;Ned S Wingreen;Stephen J Benkovic

Lignin breakdown is initiated by depolymerization catalysed by extracellular oxidoreductases secreted by white-rot basidiomycetous fungi. On the other hand, bacteria play a predominant role in the mineralization of lignin-derived heterogeneous low-molecular-weight aromatic compounds. The outline of bacterial catabolic pathways for lignin-derived bi- and monoaryls are typically composed of the following sequential steps: (i) funnelling of a wide variety of lignin-derived aromatics into vanillate and syringate, (ii) O demethylation of vanillate and syringate to form catecholic derivatives and (iii) aromatic ring-cleavage of the catecholic derivatives to produce tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. Knowledge regarding bacterial catabolic systems for lignin-derived aromatic compounds is not only important for understanding the terrestrial carbon cycle but also valuable for promoting the shift to a low-carbon economy via biological lignin valorisation.

Due to its prominent lysosomal activity and technical ease of handling, the liver has been at the center of continuous and vigorous investigations into autophagy. Many important discoveries, including suppression by insulin and plasma amino acids and stimulation by glucagon, have been made through in vivo and in vitro studies using perfused liver and cultured hepatocytes. The long-term controversy about the origin and nature of the autophagosome membrane has finally led to the conclusion of ""phagophore,"" through extensive molecular cell biological approaches enlightened by the discovery of autophagy-essential ATG genes. Furthermore, recent studies using liver-specific autophagy-deficient mice have thrown light on the unique role of a selective substrate of autophagy, p62. The stabilized p62 accumulating in autophagy-deficient liver manipulates Nrf2-dependent transcription activation through specific binding to Keap1, which results in the elevated gene expression involved in detoxification. This is the first example of the dysregulation of gene expression under autophagy deficiency. Thus, basal liver autophagy makes a large contribution to the maintenance of cell homeostasis and health. Meanwhile, precise comparisons of wild-type and liver-specific autophagy-deficient mice under starvation conditions have revealed that amino acids released by autophagic degradation can be metabolized to produce glucose via gluconeogenesis for the maintenance of blood glucose, and can also be excreted to the circulation to supply serum amino acids. These results strongly confirm that induced liver autophagy plays a pivotal role in metabolic compensation.

These enzymes also recognize as substrates other concurrent lipid mediators, whereas, in turn, endocannabinoids might interact with noncannabinoid receptors with subcellular distribution and ultimate biological actions either similar to or completely different from those of cannabinoid receptors. Even splicing variants of endocannabinoid hydrolyzing enzymes, such as FAAH-1, might play distinct roles in endocannabinoid inactivation. Finally, the products of endocannabinoid catabolism may have their own targets, with biological roles different from those of cannabinoid receptors. These peculiarities of endocannabinoid signaling have complicated the use of inhibitors of its inactivation mechanisms as a safer and more efficacious alternative to the direct targeting of cannabinoid receptors for the treatment of several pathological conditions, including pain. However, new strategies, including the rediscovery of ""dirty drugs"", and the use of certain natural products (including non-THC cannabis constituents), are emerging that might allow us to make a virtue of necessity and exploit endocannabinoid redundancy to develop new analgesics.",COX-2; FAAH-1; MAGL; TRPA1; TRPV1; cannabinoid; receptor.,Fabiana Piscitelli;Vincenzo Di Marzo

Diagnostic strategies are focused towards identification of a 17p11.2 microdeletion encompassing the gene RAI1 (retinoic acid induced 1) or a mutation of RAI1. Molecular evidence shows that most SMS features are due to RAI1 haploinsufficiency, whereas variability and severity are modified by other genes in the 17p11.2 region for 17p11.2 deletion cases. The functional role of RAI1 is not completely understood, but it is probably a transcription factor acting in several different biological pathways that are dysregulated in SMS. Functional studies based on the hypothesis that RAI1 acts through phenotype-specific pathways involving several downstream genes have shown that RAI1 gene dosage is crucial for normal regulation of circadian rhythm, lipid metabolism and neurotransmitter function. Here, we review the clinical and molecular features of SMS and explore more recent studies supporting possible therapeutic strategies for behavioural management.",,Sarah H Elsea;Stephen R Williams

However, the success rate remains relatively low, and, as typically two or more embryos are implanted, successful pregnancy often leads to multiple pregnancies with attendant complications. The major limitation in clinical IVF is the inability to predict which embryos are most viable, with the highest chance of implantation and development to a live baby. In principle, embryos can be selected for transfer based on data obtained at the genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and/or metabolomic levels; however, these measurements cannot always be made directly on the embryo without invasive biopsy of cells. Alternative strategies are needed and this review considers the range of possibilities, with a focus on the analysis of the secretome from human embryos using metabolic footprinting.",,Daniel R Brison;Katherine Hollywood;Ruth Arnesen;Royston Goodacre
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19901076/,Intrusion of a DNA repair protein in the RNome world: is this the beginning of a new era?,"Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), an essential protein in mammals, is known to be involved in base excision DNA repair, acting as the major abasic endonuclease; the protein also functions as a redox coactivator of several transcription factors that regulate gene expression. Recent findings highlight a novel role for APE1 in RNA metabolism. The new findings are as follows: (i) APE1 interacts with rRNA and ribosome processing protein NPM1 within the nucleolus; (ii) APE1 interacts with proteins involved in ribosome assembly (i.e., RLA0, RSSA) and RNA maturation (i.e., PRP19, MEP50) within the cytoplasm; (iii) APE1 cleaves abasic RNA; and (iv) APE1 cleaves a specific coding region of c-myc mRNA in vitro and influences c-myc mRNA level and half-life in cells. Such findings on the role of APE1 in the posttranscriptional control of gene expression could explain its ability to influence diverse biological processes and its relocalization to cytoplasmic compartments in some tissues and tumors. In addition, we propose that APE1 serves as a ""cleansing"" factor for oxidatively damaged abasic RNA, establishing a novel connection between DNA and RNA surveillance mechanisms. In this review, we introduce questions and speculations concerning the role of APE1 in RNA metabolism and discuss the implications of these findings in a broader evolutionary context.",,Gianluca Tell;David M Wilson 3rd;Chow H Lee

Sec is co-translationally incorporated in selenoproteins. There are 25 selenoprotein genes in humans, and Sec was found in the active site of those that have been attributed a function. This review will discuss how selenocysteine is synthesized and incorporated into selenoproteins in eukaryotes. Sec biosynthesis from serine on the tRNA(Sec) requires four enzymes. Incorporation of Sec in response to an in-frame UGA codon, otherwise signaling termination of translation, is achieved by a complex recoding machinery to inform the ribosomes not to stop at this position on the mRNA. A number of the molecular partners acting in this machinery have been identified but their detailed mechanism of action has not been deciphered yet. Here we provide an overview of the literature in the field. Particularly striking is the higher than originally envisaged number of factors necessary to synthesize Sec and selenoproteins. Clearly, selenoprotein synthesis is an exciting and very active field of research.",,Christine Allmang;Laurence Wurth;Alain Krol
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17957201/,"The tragedy of the commons in microbial populations: insights from theoretical, comparative and experimental studies","First principles of thermodynamics imply that metabolic pathways are faced with a trade-off between the rate and yield of ATP production. Simple evolutionary models argue that this trade-off generates a fundamental social conflict in microbial populations: average fitness in a population is highest if all individuals exploit common resources efficiently, but individual reproductive rate is maximized by consuming common resources at the highest possible rate, a scenario known as the tragedy of the commons. In this paper, I review studies that have addressed two key questions: What is the evidence that the rate-yield trade-off is an evolutionary constraint on metabolic pathways? And, if so, what determines evolutionary outcome of the conflicts generated by this trade-off? Comparative studies and microbial experiments provide evidence that the rate-yield trade-off is an evolutionary constraint that is driven by thermodynamic constraints that are common to all metabolic pathways and pathway-specific constraints that reflect the evolutionary history of populations. Microbial selection experiments show that the evolutionary consequences of this trade-off depend on both kin selection and biochemical constraints. In well-mixed populations with low relatedness, genotypes with rapid and efficient metabolism can coexist as a result of negative frequency-dependent selection generated by density-dependent biochemical costs of rapid metabolism. Kin selection can promote the maintenance of efficient metabolism in structured populations with high relatedness by ensuring that genotypes with efficient metabolic pathways gain an indirect fitness benefit from their competitive restraint. I conclude by suggesting avenues for future research and by discussing the broader implications of this work for microbial social evolution.",,R C MacLean

With the growing number of metabolic reconstructions, there is a need for an efficient method to enumerate pathways, which can also scale well to large metabolic networks, such as those corresponding to microbial communities. We developed MetQuest, an efficient graph-theoretic algorithm to enumerate all possible pathways of a particular size between a given set of source and target molecules. Our algorithm employs a guided breadth-first search to identify all feasible reactions based on the availability of the precursor molecules, followed by a novel dynamic-programming based enumeration, which assembles these reactions into pathways of a specified size producing the target from the source. We demonstrate several interesting applications of our algorithm, ranging from identifying amino acid biosynthesis pathways to identifying the most diverse pathways involved in degradation of complex molecules. We also illustrate the scalability of our algorithm, by studying large graphs such as those corresponding to microbial communities, and identify several metabolic interactions happening therein.

Disruption of PglC, the initiating glycosyltransferase responsible for attachment of the first sugar to undecaprenylphosphate abolished glycoprotein production and capsule biosynthesis.

However, only less than 10% of women drinking alcohol during pregnancy have children with FAS. Understanding the risk factors increasing the probability for newborn exposed in utero to alcohol to develop FAS is therefore a key issue. The involvement of genetics as a one risk factor in FAS has been suggested by animal models and by molecular epidemiological studies on different populations, bearing allelic variants for those enzymes, such as ADH e CYP2E1, involved in ethanol metabolism. Indeed, one of the major factors determining the peak blood alcohol exposure to the fetus is the metabolic activity of the mother, in addition to placental and fetal metabolism, explaining, at least partially, the risk of FAS. The different rates of ethanol metabolism may be the result of genetic polymorphisms, the most relevant of which have been described in the paper.",,Simonetta Gemma;Susanna Vichi;Emanuela Testai
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21935888/,Functional interactions between mRNA turnover and surveillance and the ubiquitin proteasome system,"The proteasome is a critical regulator of protein levels within the cell and is essential for maintaining homeostasis. A functional proteasome is required for effective mRNA surveillance and turnover. During transcription, the proteasome localizes to sites of DNA breaks, degrading RNA polymerase II and terminating transcription. For fully transcribed and processed messages, cytoplasmic surveillance is initiated with the pioneer round of translation. The proteasome is recruited to messages bearing premature termination codons, which trigger nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), as well as messages lacking a termination codon, which trigger nonstop decay, to degrade the aberrant protein produced from these messages. A number of proteins involved in mRNA translation are regulated in part by proteasome-mediated decay, including the initiation factors eIF4G, eIF4E, and eIF3a, and the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) interacting protein, Paip2. eIF4E-BP (4E-BP) is differentially regulated by the proteasome: truncated to generate a protein with higher eIF4B binding or completely degraded, depending on its phosphorylation status. Finally, a functional proteasome is required for AU-rich-element (ARE)-mediated decay but the specific role the proteasome plays is unclear. There is data indicating the proteasome can bind to AREs, act as an endonuclease, and degrade ARE-binding proteins. How these events interact with the 5'-to-3' and 3'-to-5' decay pathways is unclear at this time; however, data is provided indicating that proteasomes colocalize with Xrn1 and the exosome RNases Rrp44 and Rrp6 in untreated HeLa cells.",,Seth A Brooks

In this study, we have employed NMR metabolomics to assess how therapeutically promising flavonoids (quercetin, naringenin and naringin) affect the metabolism of human macrophages, with a view to better understand their biological targets and activity. In vitro-cultured human macrophages were polarized to the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, through incubation with LPS + IFN-γ, and subsequently treated with each flavonoid. The metabolic signatures of pro-inflammatory polarization and of flavonoid incubations were then characterized and compared. The results showed that all flavonoids modulated the cells endometabolome with the strongest impact being observed for quercetin. Many of the flavonoid-induced metabolic variations were in the opposite sense to those elicited by pro-inflammatory stimulation. In particular, the metabolic processes proposed to reflect flavonoid-mediated immunomodulation of macrophages included the downregulation of glycolytic activity, observed for all flavonoids, anti-inflammatory reprogramming of the TCA cycle (mainly quercetin), increased antioxidant protection (quercetin), osmoregulation (naringin), and membrane modification (naringenin).

However, the attempts to manipulate a metabolic pathway by following such approach have proved to be unsuccessful. Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA) establishes how to determine, quantitatively, the degree of control that a given enzyme exerts on flux and on the concentration of metabolites, thus substituting the intuitive, qualitative concept of rate limiting step. Moreover, MCA helps to understand (i) the underlying mechanisms by which a given enzyme exerts high or low control and (ii) why the control of the pathway is shared by several pathway enzymes and transporters. By applying MCA it is possible to identify the steps that should be modified to achieve a successful alteration of flux or metabolite concentration in pathways of biotechnological (e.g., large scale metabolite production) or clinical relevance (e.g., drug therapy).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23881384/,Optimization of photosynthesis by multiple metabolic pathways involving interorganelle interactions: resource sharing and ROS maintenance as the bases,"The bioenergetic processes of photosynthesis and respiration are mutually beneficial. Their interaction extends to photorespiration, which is linked to optimize photosynthesis. The interplay of these three pathways is facilitated by two major phenomena: sharing of energy/metabolite resources and maintenance of optimal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The resource sharing among different compartments of plant cells is based on the production/utilization of reducing equivalents (NADPH, NADH) and ATP as well as on the metabolite exchange. The responsibility of generating the cellular requirements of ATP and NAD(P)H is mostly by the chloroplasts and mitochondria. In turn, besides the chloroplasts, the mitochondria, cytosol and peroxisomes are common sinks for reduced equivalents. Transporters located in membranes ensure the coordinated movement of metabolites across the cellular compartments. The present review emphasizes the beneficial interactions among photosynthesis, dark respiration and photorespiration, in relation to metabolism of C, N and S. Since the bioenergetic reactions tend to generate ROS, the cells modulate chloroplast and mitochondrial reactions, so as to ensure that the ROS levels do not rise to toxic levels. The patterns of minimization of ROS production and scavenging of excess ROS in intracellular compartments are highlighted.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28493998/,Metabolomics analysis: Finding out metabolic building blocks,"In this paper we propose a new methodology for the analysis of metabolic networks. We use the notion of strongly connected components of a graph, called in this context metabolic building blocks. Every strongly connected component is contracted to a single node in such a way that the resulting graph is a directed acyclic graph, called a metabolic DAG, with a considerably reduced number of nodes. The property of being a directed acyclic graph brings out a background graph topology that reveals the connectivity of the metabolic network, as well as bridges, isolated nodes and cut nodes. Altogether, it becomes a key information for the discovery of functional metabolic relations. Our methodology has been applied to the glycolysis and the purine metabolic pathways for all organisms in the KEGG database, although it is general enough to work on any database. As expected, using the metabolic DAGs formalism, a considerable reduction on the size of the metabolic networks has been obtained, specially in the case of the purine pathway due to its relative larger size. As a proof of concept, from the information captured by a metabolic DAG and its corresponding metabolic building blocks, we obtain the core of the glycolysis pathway and the core of the purine metabolism pathway and detect some essential metabolic building blocks that reveal the key reactions in both pathways. Finally, the application of our methodology to the glycolysis pathway and the purine metabolism pathway reproduce the tree of life for the whole set of the organisms represented in the KEGG database which supports the utility of this research.",,Ricardo Alberich;José A Castro;Mercè Llabrés;Pere Palmer-Rodríguez

The largest fraction of therapeutic agents that target individual receptors/pathways eventually fail due to the emergence of compensatory mechanisms that reestablish the pathologic network. Recently, a rapidly emerging paradigm has revealed GIV/Girdin as a central platform for receptor cross-talk which integrates signals downstream of a myriad of cell surface receptors, and modulates several key pathways within downstream signaling network, all via non-canonical activation of trimeric G proteins. Unlike canonical signal transduction via G proteins, which is spatially and temporally restricted, the temporal and spatial features of non-canonical activation of G protein via GIV is unusually unrestricted. Consequently, the GIV●G protein interface serves as a central hub allowing for control over several pathways within the pathologic signaling network, all at once.

Pathways are modelled as integer hyperflows and we expand the network model by detailed routing constraints. In contrast to the more traditional approaches like Flux Balance Analysis or Elementary Mode analysis we insist on integer-valued flows. While this choice makes it necessary to solve possibly hard integer linear programs, it has the advantage that more detailed mechanistic questions can be formulated. It is thus possible to query networks for general transformation motifs, and to automatically enumerate optimal and near-optimal pathways. Similarities and differences between our work and traditional approaches in metabolic network analysis are discussed in detail. To demonstrate the applicability of the mathematical framework to real-life problems we first explore the design space of possible non-oxidative glycolysis pathways and show that recent manually designed pathways can be further optimized.

Resulting analysis of the metabolic tree confirms strong associations with well-established biological results along with direct insight into particular metabolic variants which are most predictive of metabolic diversity.

Knowledge of the metabolic state of a cell and how it responds to various stimuli and extracellular conditions can offer significant insight in the regulatory functions and how to manipulate them. Constraint based methods, such as Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) and Thermodynamics-based flux analysis (TFA), are commonly used to estimate the flow of metabolites through genome-wide metabolic networks, making it possible to identify the ranges of flux values that are consistent with the studied physiological and thermodynamic conditions. However, unless key intracellular fluxes and metabolite concentrations are known, constraint-based models lead to underdetermined problem formulations. This lack of information propagates as uncertainty in the estimation of fluxes and basic reaction properties such as the determination of reaction directionalities. Therefore, knowledge of which metabolites, if measured, would contribute the most to reducing this uncertainty can significantly improve our ability to define the internal state of the cell. In the present work we combine constraint based modeling, Design of Experiments (DoE) and Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) into the Thermodynamics-based Metabolite Sensitivity Analysis (TMSA) method. TMSA ranks metabolites comprising a metabolic network based on their ability to constrain the gamut of possible solutions to a limited, thermodynamically consistent set of internal states.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30854222/,Differential metabolic activity and discovery of therapeutic targets using summarized metabolic pathway models,"In spite of the increasing availability of genomic and transcriptomic data, there is still a gap between the detection of perturbations in gene expression and the understanding of their contribution to the molecular mechanisms that ultimately account for the phenotype studied. Alterations in the metabolism are behind the initiation and progression of many diseases, including cancer. The wealth of available knowledge on metabolic processes can therefore be used to derive mechanistic models that link gene expression perturbations to changes in metabolic activity that provide relevant clues on molecular mechanisms of disease and drug modes of action (MoA). In particular, pathway modules, which recapitulate the main aspects of metabolism, are especially suitable for this type of modeling. We present Metabolizer, a web-based application that offers an intuitive, easy-to-use interactive interface to analyze differences in pathway metabolic module activities that can also be used for class prediction and in silico prediction of knock-out (KO) effects. Moreover, Metabolizer can automatically predict the optimal KO intervention for restoring a diseased phenotype. We provide different types of validations of some of the predictions made by Metabolizer. Metabolizer is a web tool that allows understanding molecular mechanisms of disease or the MoA of drugs within the context of the metabolism by using gene expression measurements. In addition, this tool automatically suggests potential therapeutic targets for individualized therapeutic interventions.",,Cankut Çubuk;Marta R Hidalgo;Alicia Amadoz;Kinza Rian;Francisco Salavert;Miguel A Pujana;Francesca Mateo;Carmen Herranz;Jose Carbonell-Caballero;Joaquín Dopazo

A. baumannii resistance is a significant obstacle to clinical infection treatment. The existence of persister cells (persisters) might represent the reason for therapy failure and relapse, and such cells may be the driving force behind rising resistance rates. In this study, A. baumannii ATCC 19606 was used as a target to explore the essential features of A. baumannii persisters. Antibiotic treatment of A. baumannii cultures at 50-fold the minimum inhibitory concentration resulted in a distinct plateau of surviving drug-tolerant persisters. The sensitive bacteria were lysed with ceftazidime, and the nonreplicating bacteria were isolated for transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing. We analyzed the transcriptome of A. baumannii persisters and identified significantly differentially expressed genes, as well as their enriched pathways. The results showed that both the GP49 (HigB)/Cro (HigA) and DUF1044/RelB toxin/antitoxin systems were significantly increased during the persister incubation period. In addition, the activities of certain metabolic pathways (such as electron transport, adenosine triphosphate [ATP], and the citrate cycle) decreased sharply after antibiotic treatment and remained low during the persister period, while aromatic compound degradation genes were only upregulated in persisters. These results suggest the involvement of aromatic compound degradation genes in persister formation and maintenance.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20673772/,On the stability of metabolic cycles,"We investigate the stability properties of two different classes of metabolic cycles using a combination of analytical and computational methods. Using principles from structural kinetic modeling (SKM), we show that the stability of metabolic networks with certain structural regularities can be studied using a combination of analytical and computational techniques. We then apply these techniques to a class of single input, single output metabolic cycles, and find that the cycles are stable under all conditions tested. Next, we extend our analysis to a small autocatalytic cycle, and determine parameter regimes within which the cycle is very likely to be stable. We demonstrate that analytical methods can be used to understand the relationship between kinetic parameters and stability, and that results from these analytical methods can be confirmed with computational experiments. In addition, our results suggest that elevated metabolite concentrations and certain crucial saturation parameters can strongly affect the stability of the entire metabolic cycle. We discuss our results in light of the possibility that evolutionary forces may select for metabolic network topologies with a high intrinsic probability of being stable. Furthermore, our conclusions support the hypothesis that certain types of metabolic cycles may have played a role in the development of primitive metabolism despite the absence of regulatory mechanisms.",,Ed Reznik;Daniel Segrè
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29112954/,Metabolic dynamics restricted by conserved carriers: Jamming and feedback,"To uncover the processes and mechanisms of cellular physiology, it first necessary to gain an understanding of the underlying metabolic dynamics. Recent studies using a constraint-based approach succeeded in predicting the steady states of cellular metabolic systems by utilizing conserved quantities in the metabolic networks such as carriers such as ATP/ADP as an energy carrier or NADH/NAD+ as a hydrogen carrier. Although such conservation quantities restrict not only the steady state but also the dynamics themselves, the latter aspect has not yet been completely understood. Here, to study the dynamics of metabolic systems, we propose adopting a carrier cycling cascade (CCC), which includes the dynamics of both substrates and carriers, a commonly observed motif in metabolic systems such as the glycolytic and fermentation pathways. We demonstrate that the conservation laws lead to the jamming of the flux and feedback. The CCC can show slow relaxation, with a longer timescale than that of elementary reactions, and is accompanied by both robustness against small environmental fluctuations and responsiveness against large environmental changes. Moreover, the CCC demonstrates robustness against internal fluctuations due to the feedback based on the moiety conservation. We identified the key parameters underlying the robustness of this model against external and internal fluctuations and estimated it in several metabolic systems.",,Tetsuhiro S Hatakeyama;Chikara Furusawa

However, this calculation becomes very difficult when the number of differential equations is more than 100. In the present study, therefore, we investigated a calculation procedure for obtaining true steady-state metabolite concentrations both efficiently and accurately even in large-scale network models. For convenience, a linear pathway model composed of a simple Michaelis-Menten rate law and two TCA cycle models were used as case studies. The calculation procedure is as follows: first solve the differential equations by a numerical method for solving initial-value problems until the upper several digits of the calculated values stabilize, and then use these values as initial guesses for a root-finding technique. An intensive investigation indicates that the S-system technique, finding roots in logarithmic space and providing a broader convergence region, is superior to the Newton-Raphson technique, and the algorithm using the S-system technique successfully provides true steady-state values with machine accuracy even with 1,500 differential equations. The complex-step method is also shown to contribute to shortening the calculation time and enhancing the accuracy.

Conversely, population genetic thought based upon the concepts of mutation-selection-drift balance at the pathway level might suggest variation in flux controlling steps over evolutionary time. Glycolysis, as one of the most conserved and best characterized pathways, was studied to evaluate its evolutionary conservation. The flux controlling step in glycolysis was found to vary over the tree of life. Further, phylogenetic analysis suggested at least 60 events of gene duplication and additional events of putative positive selection that might alter pathway kinetic properties. Together, these results suggest that even with presumed largely negative selection on pathway output on glycolysis, the co-evolutionary process under the hood is dynamic.",Evolutionary systems biology; Glycolysis; Metabolic pathway; Protein co-evolution.,Alena Orlenko;Russell A Hermansen;David A Liberles

When such groups contain two or more enzyme-coding genes, graph analysis methods can be applied to extract a metabolic pathway that interconnects them. We describe here the way to use the Pathway extraction tool available on the NeAT Web server ( http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/neat/ ) to piece together the metabolic pathway from a group of associated, enzyme-coding genes. The tool identifies the reactions that can be catalyzed by the products of the query genes (seed reactions), and applies sub-graph extraction algorithms to extract from a metabolic network a sub-network that connects the seed reactions. This sub-network represents the predicted metabolic pathway. We describe here the pathway prediction process in a step-by-step way, give hints about the main parametric choices, and illustrate how this tool can be used to extract metabolic pathways from bacterial genomes, on the basis of two study cases: the isoleucine-valine operon in Escherichia coli and a predicted operon in Cupriavidus (Ralstonia) metallidurans.",,Karoline Faust;Jacques van Helden
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26992576/,Steady states and stability in metabolic networks without regulation,"Metabolic networks are often extremely complex. Despite intensive efforts many details of these networks, e.g., exact kinetic rates and parameters of metabolic reactions, are not known, making it difficult to derive their properties. Considerable effort has been made to develop theory about properties of steady states in metabolic networks that are valid for any values of parameters. General results on uniqueness of steady states and their stability have been derived with specific assumptions on reaction kinetics, stoichiometry and network topology. For example, deep results have been obtained under the assumptions of mass-action reaction kinetics, continuous flow stirred tank reactors (CFSTR), concordant reaction networks and others. Nevertheless, a general theory about properties of steady states in metabolic networks is still missing. Here we make a step further in the quest for such a theory. Specifically, we study properties of steady states in metabolic networks with monotonic kinetics in relation to their stoichiometry (simple and general) and the number of metabolites participating in every reaction (single or many). Our approach is based on the investigation of properties of the Jacobian matrix. We show that stoichiometry, network topology, and the number of metabolites that participate in every reaction have a large influence on the number of steady states and their stability in metabolic networks. Specifically, metabolic networks with single-substrate-single-product reactions have disconnected steady states, whereas in metabolic networks with multiple-substrates-multiple-product reactions manifolds of steady states arise. Metabolic networks with simple stoichiometry have either a unique globally asymptotically stable steady state or asymptotically stable manifolds of steady states. In metabolic networks with general stoichiometry the steady states are not always stable and we provide conditions for their stability. In order to demonstrate the biological relevance we illustrate the results on the examples of the TCA cycle, the mevalonate pathway and the Calvin cycle.",Local stability; Manifold; Metabolism; Robustness.,Oleksandr Ivanov;Arjan van der Schaft;Franz J Weissing

We analyzed the global characteristics of cytochrome P450s by building several networks at the family, subfamily, and gene levels from information on P450 substrates, inducers, and inhibitors. These networks provide insight into the relationship of cytochrome P450 isoforms on the metabolism of drugs, changes in drug activity, and the promiscuous properties of each cytochrome P450 enzyme. From the networks, we analyzed the centrality of nodes and measured the strength of correlations between two nodes by drawing promiscuity maps. In addition, heat maps were generated to cluster cytochrome P450s by their similarity within three chemical spaces (substrates, inducers, and inhibitors). We observed the intra-linking and interlinking connections between three chemical spaces, the relative correlations of a given cytochrome P450 isoform with other isoforms, and the similarity of the metabolizing ability and changing pattern by chemicals. These results provide a global view of the relationship and similarity of cytochrome P450s on various chemical spaces at various levels. The measures of the strength of connection between two cytochrome P450s and the heat-map information could be used to predict drug-drug interactions, perform phylogenetic analyses, and further understand cooperative properties of these enzymes.",,Soyoung Lee;Dongsup Kim

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17408843/,Ordering events of biochemical evolution,"Metabolic pathways exhibit structures resulting from an evolutionary process. Pathways have been inherited through time with modification, from the earliest periods of life. It is possible to compare the structure of pathways as done in comparative anatomy, i.e. for inferring ancestral pathways or parts of it (ancestral enzymatic functions), using standard phylogenetic reconstruction. Thus a phylogenetic tree of pathways provides a relative ordering of the rise of enzymatic functions. It even becomes possible to order the birth of each complete pathway in time. This particular ""DNA-free"" conceptual approach to evolutionary biochemistry is reviewed, gathering all the justifications given for it. Then, the method of assigning a given pathway to a time span of biochemical development is revisited. The previous method used an implicit ""clock"" of metabolic development that is difficult to justify. We develop a new clock-free approach, using functional biochemical arguments. Results of the two methods are not significantly different; our method is just more precise. This suggests that the clock assumed in the first method does not provoke any important artefact in describing the development of biochemical evolution. It is just unnecessary to postulate it. As a result, most of the amino acid metabolic pathways develop forwards, confirming former models of amino acid catabolism evolution, but not those for amino acid anabolism. The order of appearance of sectors of universal cellular metabolism is: (1) amino acid catabolism, (2) amino acid anabolism and closure of the urea cycle, (3) glycolysis and glycogenesis, (4) closure of the pentose-phosphate cycle, (5) closure of the Krebs cycle and fatty acids metabolism, (6) closure of the Calvin cycle.",,C Cunchillos;G Lecointre

To quantify this, it is appropriate to randomize the network and test the hypothesis that the network is not statistically different from expected in a motivated ensemble. However, when dealing with metabolic networks, the randomization of the network using edge exchange generates fictitious reactions that are biochemically meaningless. Here we provide several natural ensembles of randomized metabolic networks. A first constraint is to use valid biochemical reactions. Further constraints correspond to imposing appropriate functional constraints. We explain how to perform these randomizations with the help of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and show that they allow one to approach the properties of biological metabolic networks.

In this work, we have applied a cycle decomposition algorithm to a genome-scale metabolic model of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to analyse how acetate supply affects the distribution of fluxes that sustain cellular activity. We examined the role of metabolic cycles which explain the down regulation of photosynthesis that is observed when cells are grown in the presence of acetate. Our results suggest that acetate modulates changes in global metabolism, with the pentose phosphate pathway, the Calvin-Benson cycle and mitochondrial respiration activity being affected whilst reducing photosynthesis.

In the present work, we analyzed the H2 production capacity of five Desulfovibrio strains: Desulfovibrio vulgaris, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Desulfovibrio alaskensis, Desulfovibrio fructosivorans, and Desulfovibrio gigas. D. vulgaris showed the highest H2 productivity (865 mL Lmedium (-1)), and D. gigas the lowest one (374 mL Lmedium (-1) of H2). The electron transfer pathways involved in formate-driven H2 production by these two organisms were further investigated through the study of deletion mutants of hydrogenases (Hases) and formate dehydrogenases (Fdhs). In D. vulgaris, the periplasmic FdhAB is the key enzyme for formate oxidation and two pathways are apparently involved in the production of H2 from formate: a direct one only involving periplasmic enzymes and a second one that involves transmembrane electron transfer and may allow energy conservation. In the presence of selenium, the Hys [NiFeSe] Hase is the main periplasmic enzyme responsible for H2 production, and the cytoplasmic Coo Hase is apparently involved in the ability of D. vulgaris to grow by converting formate to H2, in sparging conditions. Contrary to D. vulgaris, H2 production in D. gigas occurs exclusively by the direct periplasmic route and does not involve the single cytoplasmic Hase, Ech.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22505679/,Regulation and evolution of malonate and propionate catabolism in proteobacteria,"Bacteria catabolize malonate via two pathways, encoded by the mdc and mat genes. In various bacteria, transcription of these genes is controlled by the GntR family transcription factors (TFs) MatR/MdcY and/or the LysR family transcription factor MdcR. Propionate is metabolized via the methylcitrate pathway, comprising enzymes encoded by the prp and acn genes. PrpR, the Fis family sigma 54-dependent transcription factor, is known to be a transcriptional activator of the prp genes. Here, we report a detailed comparative genomic analysis of malonate and propionate metabolism and its regulation in proteobacteria. We characterize genomic loci and gene regulation and identify binding motifs for four new TFs and also new regulon members, in particular, tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporters.

In the postgenomic era the use of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a simple eukaryotic model is required in molecular studies of biological activity of compounds that may be potential drugs in the future. The phenotype analysis of numerous deletion mutants (from the EUROSCARF collection) allows one to define the specific influence of tested compound on metabolism, stress generation and response of eukaryotic cell to stress. Moreover, it allows one to determine cell viability, design of new drugs and doses used in preclinical and clinical trials. Undoubtedly, this is also a good way to save the lives of many laboratory animals. Here we present a simple and cheap new approach to study the metabolic and stress response pathways in eukaryotic cells involved in the response to tested compounds (e.g., anticancer agents).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27545001/,Amino acid composition and amino acid-metabolic network in supragingival plaque,"Dental plaque metabolizes both carbohydrates and amino acids. The former can be degraded to acids mainly, while the latter can be degraded to various metabolites, including ammonia, acids and amines, and associated with acid-neutralization, oral malodor and tissue inflammation. However, amino acid metabolism in dental plaque is still unclear. This study aimed to elucidate what kinds of amino acids are available as metabolic substrates and how the amino acids are metabolized in supragingival plaque, by a metabolome analysis. Amino acids and the related metabolites in supragingival plaque were extracted and quantified comprehensively by CE-TOFMS. Plaque samples were also incubated with amino acids, and the amounts of ammonia and amino acid-related metabolites were measured. The concentration of glutamate was the highest in supragingival plaque, while the ammonia-production was the highest from glutamine. The obtained metabolome profile revealed that amino acids are degraded through various metabolic pathways, including deamination, decarboxylation and transamination and that these metabolic systems may link each other, as well as with carbohydrate metabolic pathways in dental plaque ecosystem. Moreover, glutamine and glutamate might be the main source of ammonia production, as well as arginine, and contribute to pH-homeostasis and counteraction to acid-induced demineralization in supragingival plaque.",,Jumpei Washio;Tamaki Ogawa;Keisuke Suzuki;Yosuke Tsukiboshi;Motohiro Watanabe;Nobuhiro Takahashi

Importantly, several genes involved in the ""Central carbon metabolism pathway in cancer"", as reported in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, were either up- (ACLY, ERBB2, GCK, MYC, PGM, PKFB2, SLC1A5, SLC7A5, SLC16A3,) or down- (IDH, MDH1, OGDH, P53, PDK) regulated in response to the drug association. In the present study, we conducted non-targeted metabolomics and lipidomics analyses by complementary methods and cross-platform initiatives, namely mass spectrometry (GC-MS, LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), to analyze the changes resulting from these treatments. We identified several altered biochemical pathways involved in the anabolism and disposition of amino acids, sugars, and lipids. Using the Cytoscape environment with, as an input, the identified biochemical marker changes, we distinguished the functional links between pathways. Finally, looking at the overlap between metabolomics/lipidomics and transcriptome changes, we identified correlations between gene expression modifications and changes in metabolites/lipids. Among the metabolites commonly detected by all types of platforms, glutamine was the most induced (6-7-fold), pointing to an important metabolic adaptation of cancer cells.

The desire for safe and effective vaccine of syphilis requests identification of important steps in T. pallidum's metabolism. Here, we apply Flux Balance Analysis to represent the reactions quantitatively. Thus, it is possible to cluster all reactions in T. pallidum. By calculating minimal cut sets and analyzing topological structure for the metabolic network of T. pallidum, critical reactions are identified. As a comparison, we also apply the analytical approaches to the metabolic network of H. pylori to find coregulated drug targets and unique drug targets for different microorganisms. Based on the clustering results, all reactions are further classified into various roles. Therefore, the general picture of their metabolic network is obtained and two types of reactions, both of which are involved in nucleic acid metabolism, are found to be essential for T. pallidum. It is also discovered that both hubs of reactions and the isolated reactions in purine and pyrimidine metabolisms play important roles in T. pallidum.

Yet, the mechanisms as well as the range of conditions and phenotypes associated with this behavior remain very poorly understood. Here we predict computationally and analytically that any organism evolving to maximize growth rate, ATP production, or any other linear function of metabolic fluxes tends to significantly reduce the number of active metabolic reactions compared to typical nonoptimal states. The reduced number appears to be constant across the microbial species studied and just slightly larger than the minimum number required for the organism to grow at all. We show that this massive spontaneous reaction silencing is triggered by the irreversibility of a large fraction of the metabolic reactions and propagates through the network as a cascade of inactivity. Our results help explain existing experimental data on intracellular flux measurements and the usage of latent pathways, shedding new light on microbial evolution, robustness, and versatility for the execution of specific biochemical tasks. In particular, the identification of optimal reaction activity provides rigorous ground for an intriguing knockout-based method recently proposed for the synthetic recovery of metabolic function.",,Takashi Nishikawa;Natali Gulbahce;Adilson E Motter

While the metabolic program has been related to the expression of oncogenes, only fractional information is available on how variable precarious nutrient concentrations modulate the cellular levels of metabolites and their metabolic pathways. We thus sought to obtain an overview of the metabolic routes taken by 13C-glucose-derived metabolites in breast cancer MCF-7 cells growing in combinations of limiting glucose and glutamine concentrations. Isotopologue profiles of key metabolites were obtained by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). They revealed that in limiting and standard saturating medium conditions, the same metabolic routes were engaged, including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, as well as the TCA cycle with glutamine and pyruvate anaplerosis. However, the cellular levels of 13C-metabolites, for example, serine, alanine, glutamate, malate, and aspartate, were highly sensitive to the available concentrations and the ratios of glucose and glutamine. Notably, intracellular lactate concentrations did not reflect the Warburg effect. Also, isotopologue profiles of 13C-serine as well as 13C-alanine show that the same glucose-derived metabolites are involved in gluconeogenesis and pyruvate replenishment. Thus, anaplerosis and the bidirectional flow of central metabolic pathways ensure metabolic plasticity for adjusting to precarious nutrient conditions.",13C-metabolites; TCA cycle; Warburg effect; anaplerosis; breast cancer cells; gluconeogenesis; glycolysis; isotopologue distribution; nutrient deprivation.,Maria Gkiouli;Philipp Biechl;Wolfgang Eisenreich;Angela M Otto

Our interest lies in detecting if this steady state is linearly stable or if the system has periodic solutions arising from a Hopf bifurcation. We address this by considering the sign pattern of the Jacobian matrix and its set of allowed refined inertias. The refined inertia of a matrix, which is an extension of the classical matrix inertia, is a property of its eigenvalues. A Hopf bifurcation, leading to periodic solutions, may be possible if the sign pattern of the Jacobian matrix allows a specific set of refined inertias. For most systems, we also need to consider magnitude restrictions on the entries of the Jacobian matrix that are a consequence of the particular biological model. The usefulness of sign pattern analysis to detect linear stability or the possibility of periodicity is illustrated with several biological examples, including metabolic-genetic circuits, biochemical reaction networks, predator-prey and competition systems.",Goodwin model; Lotka–Volterra system; Metabolic-genetic circuit; Periodic solution; Refined inertia; Sign pattern.,G J Culos;D D Olesky;P van den Driessche

A combination of automatic and manual approaches was used in the reconstruction process. Briefly, using the metabolic networks of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida as templates, a draft metabolic network of P. stutzeri was reconstructed. Then, the draft network was driven through an iterative and curative process of gap filling. In the next step, the model was evaluated using different experimental data such as specific growth rate, Biolog substrate utilization data and other experimental observations. In most of the evaluation cases, the model was successful in correctly predicting the cellular phenotypes.

In this study, the effects of different short-term UV-B radiation on the growth, physiology, and metabolism of Porphyra haitanensis were examined. The growth of P. haitanensis decreased, and the bleaching phenomenon occurred in the thalli. The contents of total amino acids, soluble sugar, total protein, and mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) increased under different UV-B radiation intensities. The metabolic profiles of P. haitanensis differed between the control and UV-B radiation-treated groups. Most of the differential metabolites in P. haitanensis were significantly upregulated under UV-B exposure. Short-term enhanced UV-B irradiation significantly affected amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and phenylpropane biosynthesis. The contents of phenylalanine, tyrosine, threonine, and serine were increased, suggesting that amino acid metabolism can promote the synthesis of UV-absorbing substances (such as phenols and MAAs) by providing precursor substances. The contents of sucrose, D-glucose-6-phosphate, and beta-D-fructose-6-phosphate were increased, suggesting that carbohydrate metabolism contributes to maintain energy supply for metabolic activity in response to UV-B exposure.

Some models based on complex networks have provided important information regarding this machinery. In this paper, we constructed metabolic networks of 17 plants covering unicellular organisms to more complex dicotyledonous plants. The metabolic networks were built based on the substrate-product model and a topological percolation was performed using the kcore decomposition. The distribution of metabolites across the percolation layers showed correlations between the metabolic integration hierarchy and the network topology. We show that metabolites concentrated in the internal network (maximum kcore) only comprise molecules of the primary basal metabolism. Moreover, we found a high proportion of a set of common metabolites, among the 17 plants, centered at the inner kcore layers. Meanwhile, the metabolites recognized as participants in the secondary metabolism of plants are concentrated in the outermost layers of the network. This data suggests that the metabolites in the central layer form a basic molecular module in which the whole plant metabolism is anchored. The elements from this central core participate in almost all plant metabolic reactions, which suggests that plant metabolic networks follows a centralized topology.",,Humberto A Filho;Jeaneth Machicao;Odemir M Bruno

To satisfy the increased metabolic demand required during neoplastic transformations and proliferation, cancer cells may rely on additional isoforms of a metabolic enzyme to satisfy the increased demand for metabolic precursors, which could subsequently render cancer cells more vulnerable to isoform-specific inhibitors. In this review, we provide a survey of common isoenzyme shifts that have been reported to be important in cancer metabolism and link those to metabolic pathways that currently have drugs in various stages of development. This phenomenon suggests a potentially new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer by identifying shifts in the expression of metabolic isoenzymes between cancer and normal cells. We also delineate other putative metabolic isoenzymes that could be targets for novel targeted therapies for cancer. Changes in isoenzyme expression that occur during neoplastic transformations or in response to environmental pressure in cancer cells may result in isoenzyme diversity that may subsequently render cancer cells more vulnerable to isoform-specific inhibitors due to reliance on a single isoform to perform a vital enzymatic function.",,S N Ononye;W Shi;V B Wali;B Aktas;T Jiang;C Hatzis;L Pusztai

The metabolic phenotype of GBM cells is highly dependent on glycolysis; therefore, therapeutic strategies aimed at interfering with glycolytic pathways are under consideration. 3-Bromopyruvate (3BP) is a potent antiglycolytic agent, with a variety of targets and possible effects on global cell metabolism. Here we analyzed the changes in protein expression on a GBM cell line (GL15 cells) caused by 3BP treatment using a global proteomic approach. Validation of differential protein expression was performed with immunoblotting and enzyme activity assays in GL15 and U251 cell lines. The results show that treatment of GL15 cells with 3BP leads to extensive changes in the expression of glycolytic enzymes and stress related proteins. Importantly, other metabolisms were also affected, including pentose phosphate pathway, aminoacid synthesis, and glucose derivatives production. 3BP elicited the activation of stress response proteins, as shown by the phosphorylation of HSPB1 at serine 82, caused by the concomitant activation of the p38 pathway. Our results show that inhibition of glycolysis in GL15 cells by 3BP influences different but interconnected pathways.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27897385/,Reconstruction of biological pathways and metabolic networks from in silico labeled metabolites,"Reaction atom mappings track the positional changes of all of the atoms between the substrates and the products as they undergo the biochemical transformation. However, information on atom transitions in the context of metabolic pathways is not widely available in the literature. The understanding of metabolic pathways at the atomic level is of great importance as it can deconvolute the overlapping catabolic/anabolic pathways resulting in the observed metabolic phenotype. The automated identification of atom transitions within a metabolic network is a very challenging task since the degree of complexity of metabolic networks dramatically increases when we transit from metabolite-level studies to atom-level studies. Despite being studied extensively in various approaches, the field of atom mapping of metabolic networks is lacking an automated approach, which (i) accounts for the information of reaction mechanism for atom mapping and (ii) is extendable from individual atom-mapped reactions to atom-mapped reaction networks. Hereby, we introduce a computational framework, iAM.NICE (in silico Atom Mapped Network Integrated Computational Explorer), for the systematic atom-level reconstruction of metabolic networks from in silico labelled substrates. iAM.NICE is to our knowledge the first automated atom-mapping algorithm that is based on the underlying enzymatic biotransformation mechanisms, and its application goes beyond individual reactions and it can be used for the reconstruction of atom-mapped metabolic networks. We illustrate the applicability of our method through the reconstruction of atom-mapped reactions of the KEGG database and we provide an example of an atom-level representation of the core metabolic network of E. coli.",Atom mapping; carbon labeling; metabolic networks.,Noushin Hadadi;Jasmin Hafner;Keng Cher Soh;Vassily Hatzimanikatis

However, the origins of this cycle would have arisen in the more primitive anaerobic organism or even back in the proto-metabolism, which likely arose spontaneously under favorable prebiotic chemical conditions. In this context, we report that UV irradiation of formamide in the presence of titanium dioxide afforded 6 of the 11 carboxylic acid intermediates of the reductive version of the citric acid cycle.

However, metaheuristic approaches that are known for their flexibility and scalability have been less studied. Moreover, in the existing tools, sectioning of search space to find optimal knocks has not been considered. Herein, a novel computational procedure, termed as FOCuS (Flower-pOllination coupled Clonal Selection algorithm), was developed to find the optimal reaction knockouts from a metabolic network to maximize the production of specific metabolites. FOCuS derives its benefits from nature-inspired flower pollination algorithm and artificial immune system-inspired clonal selection algorithm to converge to an optimal solution. To evaluate the performance of FOCuS, reported results obtained from both MIP and other metaheuristic-based tools were compared in selected case studies. The results demonstrated the robustness of FOCuS irrespective of the size of metabolic network and number of knockouts. Moreover, sectioning of search space coupled with pooling of priority reactions based on their contribution to objective function for generating smaller search space significantly reduced the computational time.",,Sarma Mutturi

Non-spore-forming Ethanoligenens is as a typical genus capable of ethanol-type fermentation in mixed culture (i.e. acetate-ethanol fermentation). This genus can produce ethanol, acetate, CO2, and H2 using carbohydrates, and has application potential in anaerobic bioprocesses. Here, the complete genome sequences and methylome of Ethanoligenens harbinense strains with different autoaggregative and coaggregative abilities were obtained using the PacBio single-molecule real-time sequencing platform. The genome size of E. harbinense strains was about 2.97-3.10 Mb with 55.5% G+C content. 3020-3153 genes were annotated, most of which were methylated at specific sites or motifs. The methylation types included 6mA, 4mC, and unknown types. Comparative genomic analysis demonstrated low levels of genetic similarity between E. harbinense and other well-known hydrogen-producing bacteria (i.e., Clostridium and Thermoanaerobacter) in phylogenesis. Hydrogen production of E. harbinense was catalyzed by genes that encode [FeFe]‑hydrogenases and that were synthesized by three maturases of [FeFe]-H2ase. The metabolic mechanism of H2-ethanol co-production fermentation, catalyzed by pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase was proposed. This study provides genetic and evolutionary information of a model genus for the further investigation of the metabolic pathway and regulatory network of ethanol-type fermentation and anaerobic bioprocesses for waste or wastewater treatment.",DNA methylation; Ethanol-type fermentation; Ethanoligenens harbinense; Genome; Hydrogen-producing bacteria; Single molecule DNA sequencing.,Zhen Li;Bingfeng Liu;Han Cui;Jie Ding;Huahua Li;Guojun Xie;Nanqi Ren;Defeng Xing

We know examples of such constraints, but we have no systematic understanding about their extent and causes for any one biological system. We here study metabolisms, genomically encoded complex networks of enzyme-catalyzed biochemical reactions, and the constraints they experience in bringing forth novel phenotypes that allow survival on novel carbon sources. Our computational approach does not limit us to analyzing constrained variation in any one organism, but allows us to quantify constraints experienced by any metabolism. Specifically, we study metabolisms that are viable on one of 50 different carbon sources, and quantify how readily alterations of their chemical reactions create the ability to survive on a novel carbon source. We find that some metabolic phenotypes are much less likely to originate than others. For example, metabolisms viable on D-glucose are 1835 times more likely to give rise to metabolisms viable on D-fructose than on acetate. Likewise, we observe that some novel metabolic phenotypes are more contingent on parental phenotypes than others. Biochemical similarities among carbon sources can help explain the causes of these constraints. In addition, we study metabolisms that can be produced by recombination among 55 metabolisms of different bacterial strains or species, and show that their novel phenotypes are also contingent on and constrained by parental genotypes.

The microbial composition of the three reactors, initially similar, diverged greatly after substrate change. The greatest increase in diversity was observed in the reactor supplemented with carbohydrates and the microbial community became dominated by lactobacilli, while the lowest corresponded to the reactor overfed with proteins, where only Desulfotomaculum showed significant increase.

In vitro human liver microsomes or mice liver microsomes incubation system can also give the formation of phase I metabolites. Furthermore, the phase I drug-metabolizing enzymes involved in the metabolism of bromo-noscapine was screened. Many CYP isoforms were involved in the formation of metabolite II, and CYP3A4, CYP1A1, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 were major CYP isoforms. All the determined CYP isoforms showed the catalytic activity towards the formation of metabolites III, V, and VI.

Recent evidence suggests that lipid accumulation can occur through increases of either the cytosolic copy-number of lipid droplets (LDs), or the LDs size. However, the prevailing phenotype, or how such mechanisms pertain to lipid degradation remain poorly understood. To address this shortcoming, we employed the-recently discovered-innate bioprocessing fluctuations in Yarrowia lipolytica, and performed single-cell fluctuation analysis using optical microscopy and microfluidics that generate a quasi-time invariant microenvironment. We report that lipid accumulation at early stationary phase in rich medium is substantially more likely to occur through variations in the LDs copy-number, rather than the LDs size. Critically, these mechanistics are also preserved during lipid degradation, as well as upon exposure to a protein translation inhibitor. The latter condition additionally induced a lipid accumulation phase, accompanied by the downregulation of lipid catabolism.

However, primary metabolism and enzyme expression showed remarkable changes at acute conditions (4 h and 10 h after ammonium reduction) compared with chronic conditions (18 h and 28 h time points). Responses of 145 identified metabolites were quantified using gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry; 495 proteins (including 187 enzymes) were monitored using liquid chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry with label-free spectral counting. Stress response and carbon assimilation processes (Calvin cycle, acetate uptake and chlorophyll biosynthesis) were altered first, in addition to increase in enzyme contents for lipid biosynthesis and accumulation of short chain free fatty acids.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23549172/,The Warburg effect version 2.0: metabolic reprogramming of cancer stem cells,"When fighting cancer, knowledge on metabolism has always been important. Today, it matters more than ever. The restricted cataloging of cancer genomes is quite unlikely to achieve the task of curing cancer, unless it is integrated into metabolic networks that respond to and influence the constantly evolving cancer stem cell (CSC) cellular states. Once the genomic era of carcinogenesis had pushed the 1920s Otto Warburg's metabolic cancer hypothesis into obscurity for decades, the most recent studies begin to support a new developing paradigm, in which the molecular logic behind the conversion of non-CSCs into CSCs can be better understood in terms of the ""metabolic facilitators"" and ""metabolic impediments"" that operate as proximate openings and roadblocks, respectively, for the transcriptional events and signal transduction programs that ultimately orchestrate the intrinsic and/or microenvironmental paths to CSC cellular states. Here we propose that a profound understanding of how human carcinomas install a proper ""Warburg effect version 2.0"" allowing them to ""run"" the CSCs' ""software"" programs should guide a new era of metabolo-genomic-personalized cancer medicine. By viewing metabolic reprogramming of CSCs as an essential characteristic that allows dynamic, multidimensional and evolving cancer populations to compete successfully for their expansion on the organism, we now argue that CSCs bioenergetics might be another cancer hallmark. A definitive understanding of metabolic reprogramming in CSCs may complement or to some extent replace, the 30-y-old paradigm of targeting oncogenes to treat human carcinomas, because it can be possible to metabolically create non-permissive or ""hostile"" metabotypes to prevent the occurrence of CSC cellular states with tumor- and metastasis-initiating capacity.",Warburg effect; cancer stem cells; metabolism; pluripotency; reprogramming; stemness.,Javier A Menendez;Jorge Joven;Sílvia Cufí;Bruna Corominas-Faja;Cristina Oliveras-Ferraros;Elisabet Cuyàs;Begoña Martin-Castillo;Eugeni López-Bonet;Tomás Alarcón;Alejandro Vazquez-Martin

Given that genes comprising SM pathways exhibit environmentally dependent coregulation, we hypothesized that genes within a SM pathway would form tight associations (modules) with each other in coexpression networks, facilitating their identification. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used 10 global coexpression data sets, each a meta-analysis of hundreds to thousands of experiments, across eight plant species to identify hundreds of coexpressed gene modules per data set. In support of our hypothesis, 15.3 to 52.6% of modules contained two or more known SM biosynthetic genes, and module genes were enriched in SM functions. Moreover, modules recovered many experimentally validated SM pathways, including all six known to form biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). In contrast, bioinformatically predicted BGCs (i.e., those lacking an associated metabolite) were no more coexpressed than the null distribution for neighboring genes. These results suggest that most predicted plant BGCs are not genuine SM pathways and argue that BGCs are not a hallmark of plant specialized metabolism.

Used together, flexFBA and tFBA model a time scale shorter than the regulatory and growth steady state encoded by the biomass reaction. This combined short-time FBA method is intended for integrated modeling applications to enable detailed and dynamic depictions of microbial physiology such as whole-cell modeling. For example, when modeling Escherichia coli, it avoids artifacts caused by low-copy-number enzymes in single-cell models with kinetic bounds. Even outside integrated modeling contexts, the detailed predictions of flexFBA and tFBA complement existing FBA techniques. We show detailed metabolite production of in silico knockouts used to identify when correct essentiality predictions are made for the wrong reason.",Integrated modeling; Metabolism.,Elsa W Birch;Madeleine Udell;Markus W Covert
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20140657/,Analysis and engineering of metabolic pathway fluxes in Corynebacterium glutamicum,"The Gram-positive soil bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum was discovered as a natural overproducer of glutamate about 50 years ago. Linked to the steadily increasing economical importance of this microorganism for production of glutamate and other amino acids, the quest for efficient production strains has been an intense area of research during the past few decades. Efficient production strains were created by applying classical mutagenesis and selection and especially metabolic engineering strategies with the advent of recombinant DNA technology. Hereby experimental and computational approaches have provided fascinating insights into the metabolism of this microorganism and directed strain engineering. Today, C. glutamicum is applied to the industrial production of more than 2 million tons of amino acids per year.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19141877/,Stochastic control of metabolic pathways,"We study the effect of extrinsic noise in metabolic networks. We introduce external random fluctuations at the kinetic level, and show how these lead to a stochastic generalization of standard metabolic control analysis. While summation and connectivity theorems hold true in the presence of extrinsic noise, control coefficients incorporate its effect through an explicit dependency on the noise intensity. New elasticities and response coefficients are also defined. Accordingly, the concept of control by noise is introduced as a way of tuning the systemic behaviour of metabolisms. We argue that this framework holds for intrinsic noise too, when time-scale separation is present in the system.",,Andrea Rocco
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20302968/,Identification of flux control in metabolic networks using non-equilibrium thermodynamics,A method is presented to identify flux controlling reactions in metabolic networks using experimentally determined flux distributions. The method is based on the application of Ziegler's principle for the maximization of entropy production. According to this principle a metabolic network tends to maximize the entropy production rate while satisfying mass balances and maximal rate constraints. Experimental flux data corresponding to four different metabolic states of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used to identify the corresponding flux controlling reactions. The bottleneck nature of several of the identified reactions was confirmed by earlier studies on over-expression of the identified target genes. The method also explains the failure of all the previous trials of increasing the glycolysis rate by direct over-expression of several glycolytic enzymes. These findings point to a wider use of the method for identification of novel targets for metabolic engineering of microorganisms used for sustainable production of fuels and chemicals.,,Sergio Bordel;Jens Nielsen
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19874610/,Inferring branching pathways in genome-scale metabolic networks,"Background: A central problem in computational metabolic modelling is how to find biochemically plausible pathways between metabolites in a metabolic network. Two general, complementary frameworks have been utilized to find metabolic pathways: constraint-based modelling and graph-theoretical path finding approaches. In constraint-based modelling, one aims to find pathways where metabolites are balanced in a pseudo steady-state. Constraint-based methods, such as elementary flux mode analysis, have typically a high computational cost stemming from a large number of steady-state pathways in a typical metabolic network. On the other hand, graph-theoretical approaches avoid the computational complexity of constraint-based methods by solving a simpler problem of finding shortest paths. However, while scaling well with network size, graph-theoretic methods generally tend to return more false positive pathways than constraint-based methods.",,Esa Pitkänen;Paula Jouhten;Juho Rousu

PCC 6803","Many under-developed organisms possess important traits that can boost the effectiveness and sustainability of microbial biotechnology. Photoautotrophic cyanobacteria can utilize the energy captured from light to fix carbon dioxide for their metabolic needs while living in environments not suited for growing crops. Various value-added compounds have been produced by cyanobacteria in the laboratory; yet, the products' titers and yields are often not industrially relevant and lag behind what have been accomplished in heterotrophic microbes. Genetic tools for biological process control are needed to take advantage of cyanobacteria's beneficial qualities, as tool development also lags behind what has been created in common heterotrophic hosts. To address this problem, we developed a suite of sensors that regulate transcription in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in response to metabolically relevant signals, including light and the cell's nitrogen status, and a family of sensors that respond to the inexpensive chemical, l-arabinose. Increasing the number of available tools enables more complex and precise control of gene expression.

The endogenous concentration of IAA is spatiotemporally regulated by biosynthesis, transport and its inactivation in plants. Previous studies have shown that the metabolism of IAA to 2-oxindole-3-acetic acid (OxIAA) and OxIAA-glucoside (OxIAA-Glc) may play an important role in IAA homeostasis, but the genes involved in this metabolic pathway are still unknown. In this study, we show that UGT74D1 catalyzes the glucosylation of OxIAA in Arabidopsis. By screening yeasts transformed with Arabidopsis UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT) genes, we found that OxIAA-Glc accumulates in the culture media of yeasts expressing UGT74D1 in the presence of OxIAA. Further, we showed that UGT74D1 expressed in Escherichia coli converts OxIAA to OxIAA-Glc. The endogenous concentration of OxIAA-Glc decreased by 85% while that of OxIAA increased 2.5-fold in ugt74d1-deficient mutants, indicating the major role of UGT74D1 in OxIAA metabolism. Moreover, the induction of UGT74D1 markedly increased the level of OxIAA-Glc and loss of root gravitropism. These results indicate that UGT74D1 catalyzes a committed step in the OxIAA-dependent IAA metabolic pathway in Arabidopsis.",Arabidopsis; Auxin; Glucosyltransferase; Metabolism; Plant hormone.,Keita Tanaka;Ken-ichiro Hayashi;Masahiro Natsume;Yuji Kamiya;Hitoshi Sakakibara;Hiroshi Kawaide;Hiroyuki Kasahara

We demonstrate that tandem MS provides more labeling information than can be obtained from traditional full scan MS analysis and allows estimation of fluxes with better precision. We present a modeling framework that takes full advantage of the additional labeling information obtained from tandem MS for MFA. We show that tandem MS data can be computed for any network model, any compound and any tandem MS fragmentation using linear mapping of isotopomers. The inherent advantages of tandem MS were illustrated in two network models using simulated and literature data.

By analytical calculations for various model structures of increasing complexity, we explore for which kinetic reaction rates and in which parameter ranges the resulting core models offer the decaying degree of phosphorylation that is observed in experiments. In particular, the consequences of allowing reversibility will be described and the role of the feed-forward enzymatic activation will be discussed.

Soil salinity is a major environmental constraint limiting rice productivity. Salt-tolerant 'CSR27', salt-sensitive 'MI48'and their extreme tolerant and sensitive recombinant inbred line (RIL) progenies were used for the elucidation of salt stress tolerance metabolic pathways. Salt stress-mediated biochemical and molecular changes were analyzed in the two parents along with bulked-tolerant (BT) and bulked-sensitive (BS) extreme RILs. The tolerant parent and BT RILs suffered much lower reduction in the chlorophyll as compared to their sensitive counterparts. Activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) and non-enzymatic antioxidant ascorbic acid were much higher in salt-stressed CSR27 and BT RILs than MI48 and BS RILs. Further, the tolerant lines showed significant enhancement in the levels of amino acids methionine and proline in response to salt stress in comparison to the sensitive lines. Similarly, the tolerant genotypes showed minimal reduction in cysteine content whereas sensitive genotypes showed a sharp reduction. Real time PCR analysis confirmed the induction of methionine biosynthetic pathway (MBP) enzymes cystathionine-β synthase (CbS), S-adenosyl methionine synthase (SAMS), S-adenosyl methionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) and serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT) genes in tolerant lines, suggesting potential role of the MBP in conferring salt tolerance in rice variety CSR27. Proteome profiling also confirmed higher expression of SOD, POD and plastidic CbS and other proteins in the tolerant lines, whose genes were co-located in the QTL intervals for salt tolerance mapped in the RIL population.

To gain more insights into Methanocellales, comparative genomic studies were performed among three Methanocellales strains through the same annotation pipeline. Genetic relationships among strains revealed by genome alignment, pan-genome reconstruction and comparison of amino average identity suggest that they should be classified in different genera. In addition, multiple copies of cell cycle regulator proteins were identified for the first time in Archaea. Core metabolisms were reconstructed, predicting certain unique and novel features for Methanocellales, including a set of methanogenesis genes potentially organized toward specialization in utilizing low concentrations of H2, a new route of disulfide reduction catalysed by a disulfide-reducing hydrogenase (Drh) complex phylogenetically related to sulfate-reducing prokaryotes, an oxidative tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, a sophisticated nitrogen uptake and regulation system as well as a versatile sulfur utilization system. These core metabolisms are largely conserved among the three strains, but differences in gene copy number and metabolic diversity are evident. The present study thus adds new dimensions to the unique ecophysiology of Methanocellales and offers a road map for further experimental characterization of this methanogen lineage.",,Zhe Lyu;Yahai Lu

In this study, a systems toxicology strategy integrating liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based metabonomics and transcriptomics analyses was applied for the first time to investigate the effects of PFOA on a representative Chinese normal human liver cell line L-02, with focusing on the metabolic disturbance. Fifteen potential biomarkers were identified on metabolic level and most observations were consistent with the altered levels of gene expression. Our results showed that PFOA induced the perturbations in various metabolic processes in L-02 cells, especially lipid metabolism-related pathways. The up-stream mitochondrial carnitine metabolism was proved to be influenced by PFOA treatment. The specific transformation from carnitine to acylcarnitines, which showed a dose-dependent effect, and the expression level of key genes involved in this pathway were observed to be altered correspondingly. Furthermore, the down-stream cholesterol biosynthesis was directly confirmed to be up-regulated by both increased cholesterol content and elevated expression level of key genes. The PFOA-induced lipid metabolism-related effects in L-02 cells started from the fatty acid catabolism in cytosol, fluctuated to the processes in mitochondria, extended to the cholesterol biosynthesis. Many other metabolic pathways like amino acid metabolism and tricarboxylic acid cycle might also be disturbed.

Toward better understanding of this duality in the evolution of the metabolic network, we developed a method to extract conserved sequences of reactions called reaction modules from the analysis of chemical compound structure transformation patterns in all known metabolic pathways stored in the KEGG PATHWAY database. The extracted reaction modules are repeatedly used as if they are building blocks of the metabolic network and contain chemical logic of organic reactions. Furthermore, the reaction modules often correspond to traditional pathway modules defined as sets of enzymes in the KEGG MODULE database and sometimes to operon-like gene clusters in prokaryotic genomes. We identified well-conserved, possibly ancient, reaction modules involving 2-oxocarboxylic acids. The chain extension module that appears as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) reaction sequence in the TCA cycle is now shown to be used in other pathways together with different types of modification modules. We also identified reaction modules and their connection patterns for aromatic ring cleavages in microbial biodegradation pathways, which are most characteristic in terms of both distinct reaction sequences and distinct gene clusters.

However, quantitative aspects of cyanobacterial metabolism have received limited attention. In the present study, we have performed isotopically non-stationary 13 C metabolic flux analysis (INST-13 C-MFA) to analyze rerouting of carbon in a glycogen synthase deficient mutant strain (glgA-I glgA-II) of the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. During balanced photoautotrophic growth, 10-20% of the fixed carbon is stored in the form of glycogen via a pathway that is conserved across the cyanobacterial phylum. Our results show that deletion of glycogen synthase gene orchestrates cascading effects on carbon distribution in various parts of the metabolic network. Carbon that was originally destined to be incorporated into glycogen gets partially diverted toward alternate storage molecules such as glucosylglycerol and sucrose. The rest is partitioned within the metabolic network, primarily via glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle. A lowered flux toward carbohydrate synthesis and an altered distribution at the glucose-1-phosphate node indicate flexibility in the network. Further, reversibility of glycogen biosynthesis reactions points toward the presence of futile cycles. Similar redistribution of carbon was also predicted by Flux Balance Analysis. The results are significant to metabolic engineering efforts with cyanobacteria where fixed carbon needs to be re-routed to products of interest. Biotechnol.

In this study, we characterized the differential proteome of Escherichia coli K12 BW25113 in response to chlortetracycline stress using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation labeling quantitative proteomics technology. A total of 723 proteins including 10,763 peptides were identified with 184 decreasing and 147 increasing in abundance by liquid chromatography matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Most interestingly, crucial metabolic pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle, pyruvate metabolism and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis sharply fluctuated, while the ribosome protein complexes contributing to the translation process were generally elevated in chlortetracycline stress, which is known for a compensative tactic due to the action of chlortetracycline on the ribosome. Further antimicrobial susceptibility assays validated the role of differential proteins in metabolic pathways using genetically modified mutants of gene deletion of these differential proteins.

Different parts of these metabolic networks are defined as subsystems/pathways, which are sets of functional roles to implement a specific biological process or structural complex, such as glycolysis and TCA cycle. Subsystem/pathway definition is also employed to delineate the biosynthetic routes that produce biomass building blocks. In databases, such as MetaCyc and SEED, these representations are composed of linear routes from precursors to target biomass building blocks. However, this approach cannot capture the nested, complex nature of GEMs. Here we implemented an algorithm, lumpGEM, which generates biosynthetic subnetworks composed of reactions that can synthesize a target metabolite from a set of defined core precursor metabolites. lumpGEM captures balanced subnetworks, which account for the fate of all metabolites along the synthesis routes, thus encapsulating reactions from various subsystems/pathways to balance these metabolites in the metabolic network. Moreover, lumpGEM collapses these subnetworks into elementally balanced lumped reactions that specify the cost of all precursor metabolites and cofactors. It also generates alternative subnetworks and lumped reactions for the same metabolite, accounting for the flexibility of organisms. lumpGEM is applicable to any GEM and any target metabolite defined in the network.

The purpose is to investigate the efficiency of the flux analysis when it is based on a relatively small set of extracellular measurements that can be easily achieved in most laboratories. In this case the flux analysis problem leads to a generally underdetermined mass balance system, as data are not sufficient to uniquely define the metabolic fluxes. Our main contribution is to show that, provided the system of mass balance equations is well-posed, although it is underdetermined, very narrow intervals may be found for most fluxes. The importance of checking the well-posedness of the problem is emphasized and the influence of the number of available measurements on the accuracy of the metabolic flux intervals is systematically investigated. In all cases the computed flux intervals are bounded and a single well defined value is obtained for the formation rates of the cellular macromolecules (proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids) that are not measured. The potential gain of a simple theoretical assumption regarding the metabolism of Threonine is also discussed and compared with an optimal solution calculated by maximizing the biomass formation rate.

Here we integrated a genome-scale constraint-based metabolic model with transcriptome data to explore Arabidopsis thaliana response to both elevated and low CO2 conditions. The four condition-specific models from low to high CO2 concentrations show differences in active reaction sets, enriched pathways for increased/decreased fluxes, and putative post-transcriptional regulation, which indicates that condition-specific models are necessary to reflect physiological metabolic states. The simulated CO2 fixation flux at different CO2 concentrations is consistent with the measured Assimilation-CO2intercellular curve. Interestingly, we found that reactions in primary metabolism are affected most significantly by CO2 perturbation, whereas secondary metabolic reactions are not influenced a lot. The changes predicted in key pathways are consistent with existing knowledge. Another interesting point is that Arabidopsis is required to make stronger adjustment on metabolism to adapt to the more severe low CO2 stress than elevated CO2 . The challenges of identifying post-transcriptional regulation could also be addressed by the integrative model.

One approach of calculating unknown fluxes (frequently called flux balance analysis) is based on the optimality principle of maximizing the molar yield of biotransformations. Here, the relevance and applicability of that approach are examined, and it is compared with the principle of maximizing pathway flux. We discuss diverse experimental evidence showing that, often, those biochemical pathways are operative that allow fast but low-yield synthesis of important products, such as fermentation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and several other yeast species.

We present regEfmtool which is an extension to efmtool that utilizes transcriptional regulatory networks for the computation of elementary flux modes. The implemented extension significantly decreases the computational costs for the calculation of elementary flux modes, such as runtime, memory usage and disk space by omitting biologically infeasible solutions.

The proteomic profile under this ionic stress conditions shows that important changes in gene expression take place as an adaptive response. We found a significant protein expression repression as well as metabolic changes such as the inhibition of the upper part of the glycolysis, the amino acid synthesis, and the Krebs cycle. On the other hand, genes related to stress responses, protein degradation, and sterols synthesis were upregulated in response to potassium deprivation. The findings in this study provide important information about how this particular yeast copes with ionic stress at molecular levels, which might further enrich the global understanding of salt tolerance processes in eukaryal systems and moreover highlighting the importance of the 'omics' approaches as a complement to the classical physiological studies.",,José L Martínez;Carlos Luna;José Ramos
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24055419/,Understanding alternative fluxes/effluxes through comparative metabolic pathway analysis of phylum actinobacteria using a simplified approach,"Actinobacteria are known for their diverse metabolism and physiology. Some are dreadful human pathogens whereas some constitute the natural flora for human gut. Therefore, the understanding of metabolic pathways is a key feature for targeting the pathogenic bacteria without disturbing the symbiotic ones. A big challenge faced today is multiple drug resistance by Mycobacterium and other pathogens that utilize alternative fluxes/effluxes. With the availability of genome sequence, it is now feasible to conduct the comparative in silico analysis. Here we present a simplified approach to compare metabolic pathways so that the species specific enzyme may be traced and engineered for future therapeutics. The analyses of four key carbohydrate metabolic pathways, i.e., glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, tri carboxylic acid cycle and pentose phosphate pathway suggest the presence of alternative fluxes. It was found that the upper pathway of glycolysis was highly variable in the actinobacterial genomes whereas lower glycolytic pathway was highly conserved. Likewise, pentose phosphate pathway was well conserved in contradiction to TCA cycle, which was found to be incomplete in majority of actinobacteria. The clustering based on presence and absence of genes of these metabolic pathways clearly revealed that members of different genera shared identical pathways and, therefore, provided an easy method to identify the metabolic similarities/differences between pathogenic and symbiotic organisms. The analyses could identify isoenzymes and some key enzymes that were found to be missing in some pathogenic actinobacteria. The present work defines a simple approach to explore the effluxes in four metabolic pathways within the phylum actinobacteria. The analysis clearly reflects that actinobacteria exhibit diverse routes for metabolizing substrates. The pathway comparison can help in finding the enzymes that can be used as drug targets for pathogens without effecting symbiotic organisms within the same host. This may help to prevail over the multiple drug resistance, for designing broad spectrum drugs, in food industries and other clinical research areas.",Actinobacteria; Fluxes/effluxes; Glycolysis; KEGG; Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; MVSP; Metabolic pathway; Multivariate Statistical Package; NAD+; NADPH; PEP; PRPP; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate dehydrogenase; phosphoenol pyruvate; phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate.,Mansi Verma;Devi Lal;Anjali Saxena;Shailly Anand;Jasvinder Kaur;Jaspreet Kaur;Rup Lal
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23133362/,Impact of stoichiometry representation on simulation of genotype-phenotype relationships in metabolic networks,"Genome-scale metabolic networks provide a comprehensive structural framework for modeling genotype-phenotype relationships through flux simulations. The solution space for the metabolic flux state of the cell is typically very large and optimization-based approaches are often necessary for predicting the active metabolic state under specific environmental conditions. The objective function to be used in such optimization algorithms is directly linked with the biological hypothesis underlying the model and therefore it is one of the most relevant parameters for successful modeling. Although linear combination of selected fluxes is widely used for formulating metabolic objective functions, we show that the resulting optimization problem is sensitive towards stoichiometry representation of the metabolic network. This undesirable sensitivity leads to different simulation results when using numerically different but biochemically equivalent stoichiometry representations and thereby makes biological interpretation intrinsically subjective and ambiguous. We hereby propose a new method, Minimization of Metabolites Balance (MiMBl), which decouples the artifacts of stoichiometry representation from the formulation of the desired objective functions, by casting objective functions using metabolite turnovers rather than fluxes. By simulating perturbed metabolic networks, we demonstrate that the use of stoichiometry representation independent algorithms is fundamental for unambiguously linking modeling results with biological interpretation. For example, MiMBl allowed us to expand the scope of metabolic modeling in elucidating the mechanistic basis of several genetic interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",,Ana Rita Brochado;Sergej Andrejev;Costas D Maranas;Kiran R Patil
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21276868/,Computation of metabolic fluxes and efficiencies for biological carbon dioxide fixation,"With rising energy prices and concern over the environmental impact of fossil fuel consumption, the push to develop biomass derived fuels has increased significantly. Although most global carbon fixation occurs via the Calvin Benson Bassham cycle, there are currently five other known pathways for carbon fixation; the goal of this study was to determine the thermodynamic efficiencies of all six carbon fixation pathways for the production of biomass using flux balance analysis. The three chemotrophic pathways, the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway, the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle and the dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle, were found to be more efficient than photoautotrophic carbon fixation pathways. However, as hydrogen is not freely available, the energetic cost of hydrogen production from sunlight was calculated and included in the overall energy demand, which results in a 5 fold increase in the energy demand of chemoautotrophic carbon fixation. Therefore, when the cost of hydrogen production is included, photoautotrophic pathways are more efficient. However, the energetic cost for the production of 12 metabolic precursors was found to vary widely across the different carbon fixation pathways; therefore, different pathways may be more efficient at producing products from a single precursor than others. The results of this study have significant impact on the selection or design of autotrophic organisms for biofuel or biochemical production. Overall biomass production from solar energy is most efficient in organisms using the reductive TCA cycle, however, products derived from one metabolic precursor may be more efficiently produced using other carbon fixation pathways.",,Nanette R Boyle;John A Morgan
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23326606/,Coevolution trumps pleiotropy: carbon assimilation traits are independent of metabolic network structure in budding yeast,"Phenotypic traits may be gained and lost together because of pleiotropy, the involvement of common genes and networks, or because of simultaneous selection for multiple traits across environments (multiple-trait coevolution). However, the extent to which network pleiotropy versus environmental coevolution shapes shared responses has not been addressed. To test these alternatives, we took advantage of the fact that the genus Saccharomyces has variation in habitat usage and diversity in the carbon sources that a given strain can metabolize. We examined patterns of gain and loss in carbon utilization traits across 488 strains of Saccharomyces to investigate whether the structure of metabolic pathways or selection pressure from common environments may have caused carbon utilization traits to be gained and lost together. While most carbon sources were gained and lost independently of each other, we found four clusters that exhibit non-random patterns of gain and loss across strains. Contrary to the network pleiotropy hypothesis, we did not find that these patterns are explained by the structure of metabolic pathways or shared enzymes. Consistent with the hypothesis that common environments shape suites of phenotypes, we found that the environment a strain was isolated from partially predicts the carbon sources it can assimilate.",,Dana A Opulente;Christopher M Morales;Lucas B Carey;Joshua S Rest

The distribution, overlap, and relationships of human metabolic pathways in this space are revealed using both visual and quantitative approaches. A set of selected physicochemical and topological descriptors is used to build a classifier, whose aim is to predict metabolic class and pathway membership of any small molecule. The classifier performs well for tightly clustered, isolated pathways but is, naturally, much less accurate for strongly overlapping pathways. Finally, the extent of overlap of a set of known drugs with the human metabolome is examined, and the classifier is used to predict likely cross-interactions between drugs and the major metabolic pathways in humans.",,Antonio Macchiarulo;Janet M Thornton;Irene Nobeli

In the presence of large parameter changes, a robust system should specifically avoid moving to an unstable region, an event that would dramatically change system behavior. Here we present an entropy-like index, denoted as S, for quantifying the bifurcational robustness of metabolic systems against loss of stability. We show that S enables the optimization of a metabolic model with respect to both bifurcational robustness and experimental data. We then demonstrate how the coupling of ensemble modeling and S enables us to discriminate alternative designs of a synthetic pathway according to bifurcational robustness. Finally, we show that S enables the identification of a key enzyme contributing to the bifurcational robustness of yeast glycolysis.

Here, we describe, and provide physiological examples of, a set of two-component controller motifs that show robust homeostasis. This basic set of controller motifs, which can be considered as complete, divides into two operational work modes, termed as inflow and outflow control. We show how controller combinations within a cell can integrate uptake and metabolization of a homeostatic controlled species and how pathways can be activated and lead to the formation of alternative products, as observed, for example, in the change of fermentation products by microorganisms when the supply of the carbon source is altered.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22984162/,Inhibitory cross-talk upon introduction of a new metabolic pathway into an existing metabolic network,"Evolution or engineering of novel metabolic pathways can endow microbes with new abilities to degrade anthropogenic pollutants or synthesize valuable chemicals. Most studies of the evolution of new pathways have focused on the origins and quality of function of the enzymes involved. However, there is an additional layer of complexity that has received less attention. Introduction of a novel pathway into an existing metabolic network can result in inhibitory cross-talk due to adventitious interactions between metabolites and macromolecules that have not previously encountered one another. Here, we report a thorough examination of inhibitory cross-talk between a novel metabolic pathway for synthesis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and the existing metabolic network of Escherichia coli. We demonstrate multiple problematic interactions, including (i) interference by metabolites in the novel pathway with metabolic processes in the existing network, (ii) interference by metabolites in the existing network with the function of the novel pathway, and (iii) diversion of metabolites from the novel pathway by promiscuous activities of enzymes in the existing metabolic network. Identification of the mechanisms of inhibitory cross-talk can reveal the types of adaptations that must occur to enhance the performance of a novel metabolic pathway as well as the fitness of the microbial host. These findings have important implications for evolutionary studies of the emergence of novel pathways in nature as well as genetic engineering of microbes for ""green"" manufacturing processes.",,Juhan Kim;Shelley D Copley
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21178111/,Metabolic amplification of insulin secretion by glucose is independent of β-cell microtubules,"Glucose-induced insulin secretion (IS) by β-cells is controlled by two pathways. The triggering pathway involves ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel-dependent depolarization, Ca(2+) influx, and rise in the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](c)), which triggers exocytosis of insulin granules. The metabolic amplifying pathway augments IS without further increasing [Ca(2+)](c). After exclusion of the contribution of actin microfilaments, we here tested whether amplification implicates microtubule-dependent granule mobilization. Mouse islets were treated with nocodazole or taxol, which completely depolymerized and polymerized tubulin. They were then perifused to measure [Ca(2+)](c) and IS. Metabolic amplification was studied during imposed steady elevation of [Ca(2+)](c) by tolbutamide or KCl or by comparing [Ca(2+)](c) and IS responses to glucose and tolbutamide. Nocodazole did not alter [Ca(2+)](c) or IS changes induced by the three secretagogues, whereas taxol caused a small inhibition of IS that is partly ascribed to a decrease in [Ca(2+)](c). When [Ca(2+)](c) was elevated and controlled by KCl or tolbutamide, the amplifying action of glucose was unaffected by microtubule disruption or stabilization. Both phases of IS were larger in response to glucose than tolbutamide, although triggering [Ca(2+)](c) was lower. This difference, due to amplification, persisted in nocodazole- or taxol-treated islets, even when IS was augmented fourfold by microfilament disruption with cytochalasin B or latrunculin B. In conclusion, metabolic amplification rapidly augments first and second phases of IS independently of insulin granule translocation along microtubules. We therefore extend our previous proposal that it does not implicate the cytoskeleton but corresponds to acceleration of the priming process conferring release competence to insulin granules.",,Nizar I Mourad;Myriam Nenquin;Jean-Claude Henquin

In particular, based on a recently proposed method, it is shown that it is possible to acquire a quantitative picture of the possible dynamics of metabolic systems, without assuming detailed knowledge of the underlying enzyme-kinetic rate equations and parameters. Rather, the method builds upon a statistical exploration of the comprehensive parameter space to evaluate the dynamic capabilities of a metabolic system, thus providing a first step towards the transition from topology to function of metabolic pathways.

However, daphnetin metabolism is still poorly documented. This study aimed to investigate daphnetin metabolism and its consequent effect on the bioactivity. Metabolic profiles obtained by human liver S9 fractions and human hepatocytes showed that daphnetin was metabolized by glucuronidation, sulfonation, and methylation to form 6 conjugates which were synthesized and identified as 7-O-glucuronide, 8-O-glucuronide, 7-O-sulfate and 8-O-sulfate, 8-O-methylate, and 7-O-suflo-8-O-methylate. Regioselective 8-O-methylation of daphnetin was investigated using in silico docking calculations, and the results suggested that a close proximity (2.03 Å) of 8-OH to the critical residue Lysine 144 might be the responsible mechanism. Compared with glucuronidation and sulfonation pathways, the methylation of daphnetin had a high clearance rate (470 μL/min/mg) in human liver S9 fractions and contributed to a large amount (37.3%) of the methyl-derived metabolites in human hepatocyte. Reaction phenotyping studies showed the major role of SULT1A1, -1A2, and -1A3 in daphnetin sulfonation, and soluble COMT in daphnetin 8-O-methylation.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23224080/,Systems-level characterization and engineering of oxidative stress tolerance in Escherichia coli under anaerobic conditions,"Despite many prior studies on microbial response to oxidative stress, our understanding of microbial tolerance against oxidative stress is currently limited to aerobic conditions, and few engineering strategies have been devised to resolve toxicity issues of oxidative stress under anaerobic conditions. Since biological processes, such as anaerobic fermentation, are frequently hampered by toxicity arising from oxidative stress, increased microbial tolerance against oxidative stress improves the overall productivity and yield of biological processes. Here, we show a systems-level analysis of oxidative stress response of Escherichia coli under anaerobic conditions, and present an engineering strategy to improve oxidative stress tolerance. First, we identified essential cellular mechanisms and regulatory factors underlying oxidative stress response under anaerobic conditions using a transcriptome analysis. In particular, we showed that nitrogen metabolisms and respiratory pathways were differentially regulated in response to oxidative stress under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Further, we demonstrated that among transcription factors with oxidative stress-derived perturbed activity, the deletion of arcA and arcB significantly improved oxidative stress tolerance under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively, whereas fnr was identified as an essential transcription factor for oxidative stress tolerance under anaerobic conditions. Moreover, we showed that oxidative stress increased the intracellular NADH : NAD(+) ratio under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, which indicates a regulatory role of NADH in oxidative stress tolerance. Based on this finding, we demonstrated that increased NADH availability through fdh1 overexpression significantly improved oxidative stress tolerance under aerobic conditions. Our results here provide novel insight into better understanding of cellular mechanisms underlying oxidative stress tolerance under anaerobic conditions, and into developing strain engineering strategies to enhance microbial tolerance against oxidative stress towards improved biological processes.",,Aram Kang;Mui Hua Tan;Hua Ling;Matthew Wook Chang

It is a single-compartment, variable-volume model to compute Ca mass balance during dialysis in its volume of distribution, the extracellular fluid. The model was used to analyze literature data which were suitable for the assessment of Ca mass balance over the course of dialysis. The modeled analyses predicted the serial plasma Ca concentrations very well. The mass balance analyses revealed a pool of rapidly diffusible Ca beyond the extracellular fluid distribution volume where Ca could be mobilized (M+(Ca)) or sequestered (M-(Ca)) very rapidly at rate equal but opposite in sign to dialyzer flux and thus effectively maintain near constant plasma Ca in the face of dialyzer Ca concentration gradients. This pool is likely the large pool of diffusible (miscible) Ca in connective tissue and on bone surfaces.

In particular, turning observed structural regularities into organizing principles underlying systemic functions is a crucial task that can be significantly addressed after endowing complex network representations of metabolism with the notion of geometric distance. Here, we design a cartographic map of metabolic networks by embedding them into a simple geometry that provides a natural explanation for their observed network topology and that codifies node proximity as a measure of hidden structural similarities. We assume a simple and general connectivity law that gives more probability of interaction to metabolite/reaction pairs which are closer in the hidden space. Remarkably, we find an astonishing congruency between the architecture of E. coli and human cell metabolisms and the underlying geometry.

We probed the role of VDR in developing zebrafish biology by examining changes in expression of RNA by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) in fish treated with picomolar concentrations of the VDR ligand and hormonal form of vitamin D(3), 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1α,25(OH)(2)D(3))].We observed significant changes in RNAs of transcription factors, leptin, peptide hormones, and RNAs encoding proteins of fatty acid, amino acid, xenobiotic metabolism, receptor-activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL), and calcitonin-like ligand receptor pathways. Early highly restricted, and subsequent massive changes in more than 10% of expressed cellular RNA were observed. At days post fertilization (dpf) 2 [24 h 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3)-treatment], only four RNAs were differentially expressed (hormone vs. vehicle). On dpf 4 (72 h treatment), 77 RNAs; on dpf 6 (120 h treatment) 1039 RNAs; and on dpf 7 (144 h treatment), 2407 RNAs were differentially expressed in response to 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3). Fewer RNAs (n = 481) were altered in dpf 7 larvae treated for 24 h with 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) vs. those treated with hormone for 144 h. At dpf 7, in 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3)-treated larvae, pharyngeal cartilage was larger and mineralization was greater. Changes in expression of RNAs for transcription factors, peptide hormones, and RNAs encoding proteins integral to fatty acid, amino acid, leptin, calcitonin-like ligand receptor, RANKL, and xenobiotic metabolism pathways, demonstrate heretofore unrecognized mechanisms by which 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) functions in vivo in developing eukaryotes.",,Theodore A Craig;Yuji Zhang;Melissa S McNulty;Sumit Middha;Hemamalini Ketha;Ravinder J Singh;Andrew T Magis;Cory Funk;Nathan D Price;Stephen C Ekker;Rajiv Kumar
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20679215/,Prediction of metabolic fluxes by incorporating genomic context and flux-converging pattern analyses,"Flux balance analysis (FBA) of a genome-scale metabolic model allows calculation of intracellular fluxes by optimizing an objective function, such as maximization of cell growth, under given constraints, and has found numerous applications in the field of systems biology and biotechnology. Due to the underdetermined nature of the system, however, it has limitations such as inaccurate prediction of fluxes and existence of multiple solutions for an optimal objective value. Here, we report a strategy for accurate prediction of metabolic fluxes by FBA combined with systematic and condition-independent constraints that restrict the achievable flux ranges of grouped reactions by genomic context and flux-converging pattern analyses. Analyses of three types of genomic contexts, conserved genomic neighborhood, gene fusion events, and co-occurrence of genes across multiple organisms, were performed to suggest a group of fluxes that are likely on or off simultaneously. The flux ranges of these grouped reactions were constrained by flux-converging pattern analysis. FBA of the Escherichia coli genome-scale metabolic model was carried out under several different genotypic (pykF, zwf, ppc, and sucA mutants) and environmental (altered carbon source) conditions by applying these constraints, which resulted in flux values that were in good agreement with the experimentally measured (13)C-based fluxes. Thus, this strategy will be useful for accurately predicting the intracellular fluxes of large metabolic networks when their experimental determination is difficult.",,Jong Myoung Park;Tae Yong Kim;Sang Yup Lee

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20957118/,Drug off-target effects predicted using structural analysis in the context of a metabolic network model,Recent advances in structural bioinformatics have enabled the prediction of protein-drug off-targets based on their ligand binding sites. Concurrent developments in systems biology allow for prediction of the functional effects of system perturbations using large-scale network models. Integration of these two capabilities provides a framework for evaluating metabolic drug response phenotypes in silico. This combined approach was applied to investigate the hypertensive side effect of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor torcetrapib in the context of human renal function. A metabolic kidney model was generated in which to simulate drug treatment. Causal drug off-targets were predicted that have previously been observed to impact renal function in gene-deficient patients and may play a role in the adverse side effects observed in clinical trials. Genetic risk factors for drug treatment were also predicted that correspond to both characterized and unknown renal metabolic disorders as well as cryptic genetic deficiencies that are not expected to exhibit a renal disorder phenotype except under drug treatment. This study represents a novel integration of structural and systems biology and a first step towards computational systems medicine.

Many metabolic pathway genes are targets of the c-myc oncogene and cell-cycle regulator. However, the contribution of c-Myc to the activation of cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolic networks during cell-cycle entry is unknown. Here, we report the metabolic fates of [U-(13)C] glucose in serum-stimulated myc(-/-) and myc(+/+) fibroblasts by (13)C isotopomer NMR analysis. We demonstrate that endogenous c-myc increased (13)C labeling of ribose sugars, purines and amino acids, indicating partitioning of glucose carbons into C1/folate and pentose phosphate pathways, and increased tricarboxylic acid cycle turnover at the expense of anaplerotic flux. Myc expression also increased global O-linked N-acetylglucosamine protein modification, and inhibition of hexosamine biosynthesis selectively reduced growth of Myc-expressing cells, suggesting its importance in Myc-induced proliferation. These data reveal a central organizing function for the Myc oncogene in the metabolism of cycling cells. The pervasive deregulation of this oncogene in human cancers may be explained by its function in directing metabolic networks required for cell proliferation.",,F Morrish;N Isern;M Sadilek;M Jeffrey;D M Hockenbery
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18045618/,Kinetic properties required for sustained or paradoxical control of metabolic fluxes under large changes in enzyme activities,"The effect that an increase in the activity of an enzyme has on its flux normally decreases with activity increase. To achieve a large increase in flux by manipulating a single step would therefore require a high initial effect that maintains or increases when the activity is increased, what has been called sustained or paradoxical control. Using metabolic control analysis for large responses, we derive conditions for sustained or paradoxical control in terms of elasticity coefficients. These are used to characterise types of rate laws contributing to this behaviour. The result that simple pathways, with normal kinetics, subject to large activity changes can lead to paradoxical control behaviour suggests that this type of pattern may be much more ubiquitous than could have, in principle, been suspected.",,Fernando Ortega;Marta Cascante;Luis Acerenza
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22360810/,Reverse TCA cycle flux through isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 and 2 is required for lipogenesis in hypoxic melanoma cells,"The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is the central hub of oxidative metabolism, running in the classic forward direction to provide carbon for biosynthesis and reducing agents for generation of ATP. Our metabolic tracer studies in melanoma cells showed that in hypoxic conditions the TCA cycle is largely disconnected from glycolysis. By studying the TCA branch point metabolites, acetyl CoA and citrate, as well as the metabolic endpoint glutamine and fatty acids, we developed a comprehensive picture of the rewiring of the TCA cycle that occurs in hypoxia. Hypoxic tumor cells maintain proliferation by running the TCA cycle in reverse. The source of carbon for acetyl CoA, citrate, and fatty acids switches from glucose in normoxia to glutamine in hypoxia. This hypoxic flux from glutamine into fatty acids is mediated by reductive carboxylation. This reductive carboxylation is catalyzed by two isocitrate dehydrogenases, IDH1 and IDH2. Their combined action is necessary and sufficient to effect the reverse TCA flux and maintain cellular viability.",,Fabian V Filipp;David A Scott;Ze'ev A Ronai;Andrei L Osterman;Jeffrey W Smith
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23883428/,Prediction of fraction metabolized via CYP3A in humans utilizing cryopreserved human hepatocytes from a set of 12 single donors,"1. It has previously been demonstrated that metabolism of drugs via a single enzymatic pathway, particularly CYP3A4, is associated with increased risk for drug-drug interactions (DDI). Quantitative experimental systems as well as integrated prediction models to assess such risk during the preclinical phase are highly warranted. 2. The present study was designed to systematically investigate the performance of human cryopreserved hepatocytes in suspension to predict fraction metabolized via CYP3A (fmCYP3A) by assessing the ketoconazole sensitive intrinsic clearance (CLint) for five prototypical CYP3A substrates with varying degree of CYP3A dependent CLint in twelve individual hepatocyte batches. 3. We demonstrate that in contrast to well predicted mean hepatic metabolic clearance (CLH) and mean fmCYP3A data, the variability in CYP3A contribution for compounds having multiple metabolic pathways cannot be predicted from inhibition experiments using ketoconazole as inhibitor. Instead, data in the present paper indicate that the variability is larger after inhibition of CYP3A for compounds having multiple metabolic pathways. 4. It is therefore recommended to estimate the average CLint and fmCYP3A for a given test compound in a series (n = 10) of individual human hepatocyte batches.",,C Desbans;C Hilgendorf;M Lutz;P Bachellier;T Zacharias;J C Weber;H Dolgos;L Richert;A-L Ungell

Plants grown at 21°C with a light intensity of 150 μE m⁻² sec⁻¹ were either kept at this condition or transferred into seven different environments (4°C, darkness; 21°C, darkness; 32°C, darkness; 4°C, 85 μE m⁻² sec⁻¹; 21 °C, 75 μE m⁻² sec⁻¹; 21°C, 300 μE m⁻² sec⁻¹ ; 32°C, 150 μE m⁻² sec⁻¹). Samples were taken before (0 min) and at 22 time points after transfer resulting in (8×) 22 time points covering both a linear and a logarithmic time series totaling 177 states. Hierarchical cluster analysis shows that individual conditions (defined by temperature and light) diverge into distinct trajectories at condition-dependent times and that the metabolome follows different kinetics from the transcriptome. The metabolic responses are initially relatively faster when compared with the transcriptional responses. Gene Ontology over-representation analysis identifies a common response for all changed conditions at the transcriptome level during the early response phase (5-60 min). Metabolic networks reconstructed via metabolite-metabolite correlations reveal extensive environment-specific rewiring. Detailed analysis identifies conditional connections between amino acids and intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Parallel analysis of transcriptional changes strongly support a model where in the absence of photosynthesis at normal/high temperatures protein degradation occurs rapidly and subsequent amino acid catabolism serves as the main cellular energy supply. These results thus demonstrate the engagement of the electron transfer flavoprotein system under short-term environmental perturbations.",,Camila Caldana;Thomas Degenkolbe;Alvaro Cuadros-Inostroza;Sebastian Klie;Ronan Sulpice;Andrea Leisse;Dirk Steinhauser;Alisdair R Fernie;Lothar Willmitzer;Matthew A Hannah

After 3 days of hydroponic exposure, AgNPs (1.0 and 2.5 mg/L) exerted more severe inhibitory effects on plant (shoot and root) growth and photosynthesis than the same concentrations of Ag+ ions. In soil cultivation, the photoperiod, the autonomous, and the vernalization pathways were down-regulated to 0.15- to 0.5-fold of the control after 12.5 mg/kg AgNPs treatment. This exposure caused a decrease of approximately 25%-40% as compared to the control of the transcription of flowering key genes including AP1, LFY, FT and SOC1, and finally resulted in a delayed flowering time of 5 days. Only autonomous and vernalization pathways were inhibited by Ag+ ion treatment and ultimately the time of flowering in treated plants was delayed by 3 days. The energy production related metabolic pathways in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and in sugar metabolism were stimulated stronger by AgNPs than by Ag+ ion treatment, thus releasing more energy and accelerating the physiological metabolic responses against stress in the AgNPs treatment while subsequently reducing the plant growth and yield at the maturation stage. Importantly, shikimate-phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and tryptophan and galactose metabolisms were regulated only by the AgNPs treatment, which was a specific effect of nanoparticles.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17638323/,ADME investigations of unnatural peptides: distribution of a 14C-labeled beta 3-octaarginine in rats,"The highly positively charged, cell-penetrating beta3-octaarginine has been prepared with a radioactive label by acetylation at the N-terminus with a doubly (14)C-labeled acetyl group ((14)CH3-(14)CO). With the radioactive compound, an ADME study (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion) was performed in male rats following an intravenous or oral dose of 1 mg/kg. Sampling was carried out after periods ranging from 5 min to 4 d or 7 d for blood/excretia and quantitative whole-body autoradioluminography (QWBA), respectively. After p.o. dosing, no systemic exposure to peptide-related radioactivity was observed, and the dose was completely excreted in the feces within 24 h suggesting the absence of relevant absorption; less than 3% of the i.v. dose was excreted from the animals within 4 d. Blood levels, after i.v. dosing, dropped within 4 d to less than 2% of Cmax and decreased afterwards only very slowly. No metabolites were observed in the systemic circulation. QWBA Data indicated that the distribution of the acetyl-beta-octaarginine-related radioactivity in the organs and tissues shifted over time. Notably, after 7 d, the highest concentration was measured in the lymph nodes, and the largest amount was found in the liver. A comparison with the results of two previous ADME investigations of beta-peptides (cf. Table 1) reveals that the distribution of the compounds within the animals is structure-dependent, and that there is a full range from oral availability with rather rapid excretion (of a tetrapeptide) to essentially complete lack of both oral absorption and excretion after i.v. administration (of a highly charged octapeptide). A discussion is presented about the in vivo stability and 'drug-ability' of peptides. In general, beta-peptides bearing proteinogenic side chains are compared with peptides consisting entirely of D-alpha-amino acid residues (the enantiomers of the 'natural' building blocks), and suggestions are made regarding a possible focus of future biomedical investigations with beta-peptides.",,H Markus Weiss;Bernard Wirz;Alain Schweitzer;René Amstutz;Maria I Rodriguez Perez;Hendrik Andres;Yves Metz;James Gardiner;Dieter Seebach

Metabolic exchanges occur between host and bacteria but also between different endocytobionts. Since a complete genome annotation is available for both, we built the metabolic network of two endosymbiotic bacteria, Sulcia muelleri and Baumannia cicadellinicola, that live inside specific cells of the sharpshooter Homalodisca coagulata and studied the metabolic exchanges involving transfers of carbon atoms between the three. We automatically determined the set of metabolites potentially exogenously acquired (seeds) for both metabolic networks. We show that the number of seeds needed by both bacteria in the carbon metabolism is extremely reduced. Moreover, only three seeds are common to both metabolic networks, indicating that the complementarity of the two metabolisms is not only manifested in the metabolic capabilities of each bacterium, but also by their different use of the same environment. Furthermore, our results show that the carbon metabolism of S. muelleri may be completely independent of the metabolic network of B. cicadellinicola. On the contrary, the carbon metabolism of the latter appears dependent on the metabolism of S. muelleri, at least for two essential amino acids, threonine and lysine. Next, in order to define which subsets of seeds (precursor sets) are sufficient to produce the metabolites involved in a symbiotic function, we used a graph-based method, PITUFO, that we recently developed. Our results highly refine our knowledge about the complementarity between the metabolisms of the two bacteria and their host. We thus indicate seeds that appear obligatory in the synthesis of metabolites are involved in the symbiotic function. Our results suggest both B. cicadellinicola and S. muelleri may be completely independent of the metabolites provided by the co-resident endocytobiont to produce the carbon backbone of the metabolites provided to the symbiotic system (., thr and lys are only exploited by B. cicadellinicola to produce its proteins).",,Ludovic Cottret;Paulo Vieira Milreu;Vicente Acuña;Alberto Marchetti-Spaccamela;Leen Stougie;Hubert Charles;Marie-France Sagot

In order to predict drug targets in silico, a useful model for the metabolism is needed. However, automatically reconstructed network models typically cover more non-confirmed enzymes than confirmed enzymes of known gene products. Furthermore, it needs to be considered that the parasite takes advantage of the metabolism of the host. We compared several reconstructed network models and aimed to find the best suitable reconstruction for detecting drug targets in silico. We computationally reconstructed the metabolism based on automatically inferred enzymes and compared this with a reconstructed model that was based only on enzymes whose coding genes are known. Additionally, we tested if integrating enzymes of the host cell is beneficial for such an analysis. We employed several well established criteria for defining essential enzymes including chokepoints, betweenness centrality (or load-points), connectivity and the diameter of the networks. Comparing the modeling results with a comprehensive list of known drug targets for P. falciparum, showed that we had the best discovery success with a network model consisting only of enzymes from the parasite alone which coding genes were known.",,Segun Fatumo;Kitiporn Plaimas;Ezekiel Adebiyi;Rainer König

The objectives of this study were to examine metabolic profiles altered by exogenous treatment of creeping bentgrass with an ethylene inhibitor, cytokinin or nitrogen under heat stress and to determine metabolic pathways regulated by those compounds in association with their effectiveness for improving heat tolerance. Creeping bentgrass (Agostis stolonifera) plants (cv. Penncross) were foliar sprayed with 18 mM carbonyldiamide (N source), 25 μM aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG, ethylene inhibitor), 25 μM zeatin riboside (ZR, cytokinin), or a water control, and then exposed to 20/15°C (day/night) or 35/30°C (heat stress) in growth chambers. All three exogenous treatments suppressed leaf senescence, as manifested by increased turf quality and chlorophyll content, and reduced electrolyte leakage under heat stress. Polar metabolite profiling identified increases in the content of certain organic acids (i.e. citric and malic acid), sugar alcohols, disaccharides (sucrose), and decreased accumulations of monosaccharides (i.e. glucose and fructose) with exogenous treatment of N, AVG, or ZR at the previously mentioned concentrations when compared to the untreated control under heat stress. Nitrogen stimulated amino acid accumulation whereas AVG and ZR reduced amino acid accumulation compared to the untreated control under heat stress. These results revealed that the alleviation of heat-induced leaf senescence by N, AVG, and ZR could be due to changes in the accumulation of metabolites involved in osmoregulation, antioxidant metabolism, carbon and nitrogen metabolism, as well as stress signaling molecules.",,David Jespersen;Jingjin Yu;Bingru Huang

Infection with A. hydrophila results in severe economic losses to the aquaculture industry. In humans, Aeromonas hydrophila infections are known to cause gastroenteritis and wound infections. Investigations for developing a potential vaccine for its control are underway. The availability of the complete sequence information of A. hydrophila strain ATCC 7966T genome has made it possible to carry out the in silico analysis of its genome for various aspects of its biology. Keeping in view the possible risks that A. hydrophila poses to humans, in silico analysis of the A. hydrophila genome was carried out for the identification of potential vaccine and drug targets.

Screening these genes using the Database of Essential Genes (DEG) resulted in the identification of 379 genes as essential genes of the bacteria. Further analysis of the identified essential genes, using the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways database, revealed 87 enzymes of A. hydrophila that may be used as drug targets, as they are not present in humans. Of these, 15 enzymes belong to pathways present only in the bacteria, whereas 72 enzymes are from the pathways that are common to both human and the bacteria.

We have used an integrated, untargeted metabolic footprinting approach to systematically evaluate the uptake and release of metabolites between a model marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp.

Surprisingly, Synechococcus was found to uptake a great diversity of metabolites dominant in and specific to its own metabolite extract including histidine betaine (hercynine), γ-glutamyl phenylalanine and a hexosamine-based trisaccharide. This provides Synechococcus a mechanism to benefit from the lysis of part of their population (i.e. due to environmental stress or predation). Additionally, stable isotope probing was used to show that adenine and glutamate are actively metabolized following uptake. A significant turnover of glucosylglycerol, a cyanobacterial compatible solute, as opposed to a negligible turnover of the hexosamine-based trisaccharide were also observed using stable isotope probing.

However, some bacteria can grow well due to their adaptive mechanisms. Our goal was to characterize the adaptations required for Pseudomonas aeruginosa proliferation in fuel. We have used DNA-microarrays and RT-PCR to characterize the transcriptional response of P. aeruginosa to fuel. Transcriptomics revealed that genes essential for medium- and long-chain n-alkane degradation including alkB1 and alkB2 were transcriptionally induced. Gas chromatography confirmed that P. aeruginosa possesses pathways to degrade different length n-alkanes, favoring the use of n-C11-18. Furthermore, a gamut of synergistic metabolic pathways, including porins, efflux pumps, biofilm formation, and iron transport, were transcriptionally regulated. Bioassays confirmed that efflux pumps and biofilm formation were required for growth in jet fuel. Furthermore, cell homeostasis appeared to be carefully maintained by the regulation of porins and efflux pumps. The Mex RND efflux pumps were required for fuel tolerance; blockage of these pumps precluded growth in fuel.

Nonlactating, pregnant (208 ± 19 d of gestation or approximately 75 d precalving) dairy cows (n = 90) were randomly allocated to either a control diet (i.e., offered fresh autumn pasture to maintenance requirements: 0.55 MJ ME/kg of measured metabolic BW [BW0.75] per day) or, in addition to the control diet, 1 of 2 supplement amounts (2.5 and 5.0 kg DM/d) of autumn pasture or 1 of 4 supplementary feeds (i.e., a control and 2 levels of feeding for each of 5 feeds: 11 groups of cows). Along with autumn pasture, evaluated feeds included spring pasture silage, maize silage, maize grain, and palm kernel expeller. Adipose and liver tissues were biopsied in wk 4 of the experiment and transcript abundance of genes involved in metabolic pathways associated with energy metabolism, lipolysis, and lipogenesis was determined. Additional feed, irrespective of type, increased BW gain (P < 0.01) and this effect was reflected in the expression of genes in adipose and liver tissue. However, autumn pasture had lower energy-use efficiency than the other feeds. Genes involved in both lipogenesis (ACACA, THRSP, GPAM, GPD1, and LPL) and lipolysis (PNPLA2) were upregulated (P < 0.05) in adipose tissue in response to increased ME intake/kilogram BW0.75. Hepatic expression of APOA1 decreased and that of APOB increased (P < 0.05) in cows offered maize grain and maize silage (i.e., starch-containing feeds). In comparison, pasture-fed cows demonstrated a degree of uncoupling of the somatotropic axis, with lower hepatic transcript abundance of both GHR1A and IGF-1 compared with cows offered any of the other 4 feeds.

Here, we demonstrate that a single TrmB family transcription factor in Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 globally coordinates functionally linked enzymes of diverse phylogeny in response to changes in carbon source availability. Specifically, during nutritional limitation, TrmB binds a cis-regulatory element to activate or repress 113 promoters of genes encoding enzymes in diverse metabolic pathways. By this mechanism, TrmB coordinates the expression of glycolysis, TCA cycle, and amino-acid biosynthesis pathways with the biosynthesis of their cognate cofactors (e.g. purine and thiamine). Notably, the TrmB-regulated metabolic network includes enzyme-coding genes that are uniquely archaeal as well as those that are conserved across all three domains of life. Simultaneous analysis of metabolic and gene regulatory network architectures suggests an ongoing process of co-evolution in which TrmB integrates the expression of metabolic enzyme-coding genes of diverse origins.",,Amy K Schmid;David J Reiss;Min Pan;Tie Koide;Nitin S Baliga
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19541909/,Can the whole be less than the sum of its parts? Pathway analysis in genome-scale metabolic networks using elementary flux patterns,"Elementary modes represent a valuable concept in the analysis of metabolic reaction networks. However, they can only be computed in medium-size systems, preventing application to genome-scale metabolic models. In consequence, the analysis is usually constrained to a specific part of the known metabolism, and the remaining system is modeled using abstractions like exchange fluxes and external species. As we show by the analysis of a model of the central metabolism of Escherichia coli that has been previously analyzed using elementary modes, the choice of these abstractions heavily impacts the pathways that are detected, and the results are biased by the knowledge of the metabolic capabilities of the network by the user. In order to circumvent these problems, we introduce the concept of elementary flux patterns, which explicitly takes into account possible steady-state fluxes through a genome-scale metabolic network when analyzing pathways through a subsystem. By being similar to elementary mode analysis, our concept now allows for the application of many elementary-mode-based tools to genome-scale metabolic networks. We present an algorithm to compute elementary flux patterns and analyze a model of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and adjacent reactions in E. coli. Thus, we detect several pathways that can be used as alternative routes to some central metabolic pathways. Finally, we give an outlook on further applications like the computation of minimal media, the development of knockout strategies, and the analysis of combined genome-scale networks.",,Christoph Kaleta;Luís Filipe de Figueiredo;Stefan Schuster
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24971802/,Transient and sustained elementary flux mode networks on a catalytic string-based chemical evolution model,"Theoretical models designed to test the metabolism-first hypothesis for prebiotic evolution have yield strong indications about the hypothesis validity but could sometimes use a more extensive identification between model objects and real objects towards a more meaningful interpretation of results. In an attempt to go in that direction, the string-based model SSE (""steady state evolution"") was developed, where abstract molecules (strings) and catalytic interaction rules are based on some of the most important features of carbon compounds in biological chemistry. The system is open with a random inflow and outflow of strings but also with a permanent string food source. Although specific catalysis is a key aspect of the model, used to define reaction rules, the focus is on energetics rather than kinetics. Standard energy change tables were constructed and used with standard formation reactions to track energy flows through the interpretation of equilibrium constant values. Detection of metabolic networks on the reaction system was done with elementary flux mode (EFM) analysis. The combination of these model design and analysis options enabled obtaining metabolic and catalytic networks showing several central features of biological metabolism, some more clearly than in previous models: metabolic networks with stepwise synthesis, energy coupling, catalysts regulation, SN2 coupling, redox coupling, intermediate cycling, coupled inverse pathways (metabolic cycling), autocatalytic cycles and catalytic cascades. The results strongly suggest that the main biological metabolism features, including the genotype-phenotype interpretation, are caused by the principles of catalytic systems and are prior to modern genetic systems principles. It also gives further theoretical support to the thesis that the basic features of biologic metabolism are a consequence of the time evolution of a random catalyst search working on an open system with a permanent food source. The importance of the food source characteristics and evolutionary possibilities are discussed.",Artificial chemistry; Catalytic network model; Chemical evolution model; Elementary flux modes; Metabolism-first; Pattern-matching catalysis.,José A Pereira

The models are based either on metabolic control theory (MCT), with the assumption that enzymes are far from saturation, or on Michaelis-Menten kinetics, which allows for saturation and near saturation. Several predictions emerge from the models: (1) flux control evolves to be concentrated at pathway branch points, including the first enzyme in the pathway. (2) When flux is far from its optimum, adaptive substitutions occur disproportionately often in branching enzymes. (3) When flux is near its optimum, adaptive substitutions occur disproportionately often in nonbranching enzymes. (4) Slightly deleterious substitutions occur disproportionately often in nonbranching enzymes. (5) In terms of both flux control and patterns of substitution, pathway branches are similar to those predicted for linear pathways.

Previous studies have developed efficient MFC configurations to convert metabolic electron shuttles, such as cytoplasmic NADH, into usable electric current. However, no studies have elucidated the maximum potential of S. cerevisiae for current output and the underlying metabolic pathways, resulting from the interaction of thousands of reactions inside the cell during MFC operation. To address these two key issues, this study used in silico metabolic engineering techniques, flux balance analysis (FBA), and flux variability analysis with target flux minimization (FATMIN), to model the metabolic perturbation of S. cerevisiae under the MFC-energy extraction. The FBA results showed that, in the cytoplasmic NADH-dependent mediated electron transfer (MET) mode, S. cerevisiae had a potential to produce currents at up to 5.781 A/gDW for the anaerobic and 6.193 A/gDW for the aerobic environments. The FATMIN results showed that the aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms are resilient, relying on six and five contributing reactions respectively for high current production. Two reactions, catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase (NAD) (EC 1.4.1.3) and methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NAD) (EC 1.5.1.5), were shared in both current-production modes and contributed to over 80% of the identified maximum current outputs. It is also shown that the NADH regeneration was much less energy costly than biomass production rate. Taken together, our finding suggests that S. cerevisiae should receive more research effort for MFC electricity production.",FATMIN; MFC; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; bioelectricity; flux balance analysis; flux minimization; flux variability analysis; microbial fuel cell.,Longfei Mao;Wynand S Verwoerd

Thus, knowledge about metabolic fluxes on a large scale provides an integrated view on the functional state of a metabolically active cell, organ, or system.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17503366/,Structural analysis of expressed metabolic subnetworks,"Expression of metabolic enzymes increases the metabolic capabilities of the cell, but it also consumes resources, and the gene regulatory systems of cells have to handle this tradeoff. To study whether gene expression patterns reflect the varying metabolic needs of the cell, we translated gene expression profiles into sets of active biochemical reactions, which constitute the expressed metabolic subnetworks. The metabolic capacity of a carbon source denotes the number of metabolites that can be produced from this carbon source and some inorganic nutrients. We studied the metabolic subnetworks that are expressed during diauxic shift in yeast and found that the capacities of different carbon sources tend to decrease during the diauxic shift. The subnetwork expressed in the initial glucose environment shows a high capacity of glucose, much higher than networks of the same size arising in later stages of the diauxic shift or from a random selection of reactions. The same holds for the essential capacity, the number of important, constitutive compounds that can be produced from glucose. These findings indicate that gene regulation increases the range of essential compounds that can be obtained from the available nutrients, while minimising the number of expressed enzymes and therefore the burden of protein synthesis.",,Oliver Ebenhöh;Wolfram Liebermeister

Alteration of these performances results from microorganism ability to modulate their physiology at metabolic and/or transcriptional levels in order to survive in a given environment. Until now, dynamics of both metabolic and transcriptional microbial response to external stimuli have been investigated using mainly ex situ measurements with sampling and/or quenching constraints. This work showed an in situ bioluminescence approach for real-time monitoring of characteristic stress responses of Escherichia coli containing yciG::luxCDABE reporter to glucose pulses in well-controlled steady-state chemostat cultures. Reproducibility of in situ bioluminescence profiles was assessed. A dramatic transient increase in the bioluminescence intensity (sharp peak) was observed for a complete depletion of sugars and for a sudden decrease in the dilution rate. This response was connected to a sudden change of the metabolic activity. On the contrary a bell curve of bioluminescence intensity, dose-dependent, was related to an induction of transcriptional activity. Real-time monitoring of the bioluminescence signal with time-span less than a second gave access to the characteristic times of the metabolic shift and transcriptional induction of the stress response.",,Sirichai Sunya;Nathalie Gorret;Frank Delvigne;Jean-Louis Uribelarrea;Carole Molina-Jouve

Thus, reliable preclinical tools for the detection of major human metabolites are of high importance. The aim of this study was to compare major drug metabolic pathways in HepaRG cells, a human hepatoma cell line, to fresh human hepatocytes, cryopreserved human hepatocytes, and human in vivo data. Furthermore, the maintenance of cytochrome P450 (P450) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) activities in a dynamic three-dimensional (3D) bioreactor were evaluated over time by using HepaRG cells and human hepatocytes. (14)C-diclofenac and a candidate from AstraZeneca's drug development program, (14)C-AZD6610, which are metabolized by P450 and UGT in vivo, were used as model substrates. The proportion of relevant biotransformation pathways of the investigated drug was clearly different in the various cell systems. The hydroxylation route was favored in primary human hepatocytes, whereas the glucuronidation route was favored in HepaRG cells. The human in vivo metabolite profile of AZD6610 was best represented by human hepatocytes, whereas all major diclofenac metabolites were detected in HepaRG cells. Moreover, the metabolite profiles in cryopreserved and fresh human hepatocytes were essentially the same. The liver bioreactor using both fresh human hepatocytes and HepaRG cells retained biotransformation capacity over 1 week.

However, how to quantify the global stability of the metabolic networks is still challenging. We develop a probabilistic landscape approach to investigate the global natures of the metabolic system under external fluctuations. As an example, we choose a model of the carbohydrate metabolism and the anaplerotic synthesis of oxalacetate in Aspergillus niger under conditions of citric acid accumulation to explore landscape topography. The landscape has a funnel shape, which guarantees the robustness of system under fluctuations and perturbations. Robustness ratio (RR), defined as the ratio of gap between lowest potential and average potential versus roughness measured by the dispersion or square root of variations of potentials, can be used to quantitatively evaluate the global stability of metabolic networks, and the larger the RR value, the more stable the system. Results of the entropy production rate imply that nature might evolve such that the network is robust against perturbations from environment or network wirings and performs specific biological functions with less dissipation cost. We also carried out a sensitivity analysis of parameters and uncovered some key network structure factors such as kinetic rates or wirings connecting the protein species nodes, which influence the global natures of the system. We found there is a strong correlation between the landscape topography and the input-output response. The more stable and robust the metabolic network is, the sharper the response is.",,Chunhe Li;Erkang Wang;Jin Wang

This mutant exhibited differences in germination rate, plant height, and root length in seedlings compared to the wild-type plants. We found 1645 different expressed probes of MT by microarray hybridization. To identify the modified metabolic pathways, we conducted integrated genomic analysis such as weighted correlation network analysis with a module detection method of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in MT on the basis of large-scale microarray transcriptional profiling. These modules are largely divided into three subnetworks and mainly exhibit overrepresented gene ontology functions such as oxidation-related function, ion-binding, and kinase activity (phosphorylation), and the expressional coherences of module genes mainly exhibited in vegetative and maturation stages. Through a metabolic pathway analysis, we detected the significant DEGs involved in the major carbohydrate metabolism (starch degradation), protein degradation (aspartate protease), and signaling in sugars and nutrients. Furthermore, the accumulation of amino acids (asparagine and glutamic acid), sucrose, and starch in MT were affected by gamma rays.

Presented herein is a genome-scale mouse metabolic model that was systematically reconstructed by improving and expanding the previous generic model based on integrated biochemical and genomic data of Mus musculus. The key features of the updated model include additional information on gene-protein-reaction association, and improved network connectivity through lipid, amino acid, carbohydrate and nucleotide biosynthetic pathways. After examining the model predictability both quantitatively and qualitatively using constraints-based flux analysis, the structural and functional characteristics of the mouse metabolism were investigated by evaluating network statistics/centrality, gene/metabolite essentiality and their correlation. The results revealed that overall mouse metabolic network is topologically dominated by highly connected and bridging metabolites, and functionally by lipid metabolism that most of essential genes and metabolites are from.

In contrast to previous approaches, the method described here takes into account the fact that, in a viable network, reactions must be capable of sustaining a steady-state flux. In order to achieve this decomposition we introduce a new concept--the reaction correlation coefficient, phi, and show that this is a logical extension of the concept of enzyme (or reaction) subsets. In addition to their application to modular decomposition, reaction correlation coefficients have a number of other interesting properties, including a convenient means for identifying disconnected subnetworks in a system and potential applications to metabolic engineering. The method computes reaction correlation coefficients from an orthonormal basis of the null-space of the stoichiometry matrix. We show that reaction correlation coefficients are uniquely defined, even though the basis of the null-space is not. Once a complete set of reaction correlation coefficients is calculated, a metabolic reaction tree can be determined through the application of standard programming techniques.

The robustness measures are based on the ratio of the number of remaining EFMs after knockout vs. the number of EFMs in the unperturbed situation, averaged over all combinations of knockouts. With the help of simple examples we demonstrate that consideration of multiple knockouts yields additional information going beyond single-knockout results. It is proven that the robustness score decreases as the knockout depth increases. We apply our extended framework to metabolic networks representing amino acid anabolism in Escherichia coli and human hepatocytes, and the central metabolism in human erythrocytes. Moreover, in the E. coli model the two subnetworks synthesising amino acids that are essential and those that are non-essential for humans are studied separately. The results are discussed from an evolutionary viewpoint. We find that E. coli has the most robust metabolism of all the cell types studied here.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27870845/,Identification of Conserved Moieties in Metabolic Networks by Graph Theoretical Analysis of Atom Transition Networks,"Conserved moieties are groups of atoms that remain intact in all reactions of a metabolic network. Identification of conserved moieties gives insight into the structure and function of metabolic networks and facilitates metabolic modelling. All moiety conservation relations can be represented as nonnegative integer vectors in the left null space of the stoichiometric matrix corresponding to a biochemical network. Algorithms exist to compute such vectors based only on reaction stoichiometry but their computational complexity has limited their application to relatively small metabolic networks. Moreover, the vectors returned by existing algorithms do not, in general, represent conservation of a specific moiety with a defined atomic structure. Here, we show that identification of conserved moieties requires data on reaction atom mappings in addition to stoichiometry. We present a novel method to identify conserved moieties in metabolic networks by graph theoretical analysis of their underlying atom transition networks. Our method returns the exact group of atoms belonging to each conserved moiety as well as the corresponding vector in the left null space of the stoichiometric matrix. It can be implemented as a pipeline of polynomial time algorithms. Our implementation completes in under five minutes on a metabolic network with more than 4,000 mass balanced reactions.

We propose a very accurate strategy to overcome this challenge. Its core concept is the conversion of the model into the format of biochemical systems theory (BST), which greatly facilitates the computation of sensitivities. First, the steady state of interest is determined by integrating the model equations toward the steady state and then using a Newton-Raphson method to fine-tune the result. The second step of conversion into the BST format requires several instances of numerical differentiation. The accuracy of this task is ensured by the use of a complex-variable Taylor scheme for all differentiation steps. The proposed strategy is implemented in a new software program, COSMOS, which automates the stability and sensitivity analysis of essentially arbitrary ODE models in a quick, yet highly accurate manner. The methods underlying the process are theoretically analyzed and illustrated with four representative examples: a simple metabolic reaction model; a model of aspartate-derived amino acid biosynthesis; a TCA-cycle model; and a modified TCA-cycle model.

It turns out that our reaction classifier, which is blind to the biochemical role of pathways, leads to three functionally relevant subnetworks that correspond to input, output, and intermediate parts of the metabolic network with distinct structural characteristics. Our decomposition method unveils a functional bow-tie organization of metabolic networks that is different from the bow-tie structure determined by graph-theoretic methods that do not incorporate functionality.",,Shalini Singh;Areejit Samal;Varun Giri;Sandeep Krishna;Nandula Raghuram;Sanjay Jain
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18451861/,Hierarchical structure and the prediction of missing links in networks,"Networks have in recent years emerged as an invaluable tool for describing and quantifying complex systems in many branches of science. Recent studies suggest that networks often exhibit hierarchical organization, in which vertices divide into groups that further subdivide into groups of groups, and so forth over multiple scales. In many cases the groups are found to correspond to known functional units, such as ecological niches in food webs, modules in biochemical networks (protein interaction networks, metabolic networks or genetic regulatory networks) or communities in social networks. Here we present a general technique for inferring hierarchical structure from network data and show that the existence of hierarchy can simultaneously explain and quantitatively reproduce many commonly observed topological properties of networks, such as right-skewed degree distributions, high clustering coefficients and short path lengths. We further show that knowledge of hierarchical structure can be used to predict missing connections in partly known networks with high accuracy, and for more general network structures than competing techniques. Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchy is a central organizing principle of complex networks, capable of offering insight into many network phenomena.",,Aaron Clauset;Cristopher Moore;M E J Newman
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18075678/,Proximate parameter tuning for biochemical networks with uncertain kinetic parameters,"It is commonly the case in biochemical modelling that we have knowledge of the qualitative 'structure' of a model and some measurements of the time series of the variables of interest (concentrations and fluxes), but little or no knowledge of the model's parameters. This is, then, a system identification problem, that is commonly addressed by running a model with estimated parameters and assessing how far the model's behaviour is from the 'target' behaviour of the variables, and adjusting parameters iteratively until a good fit is achieved. The issue is that most of these problems are grossly underdetermined, such that many combinations of parameters can be used to fit a given set of variables. We introduce the constraint that the estimated parameters should be within given bounds and as close as possible to stated nominal values. This deterministic 'proximate parameter tuning' algorithm turns out to be exceptionally effective, and we illustrate its utility for models of p38 signalling, of yeast glycolysis and for a benchmark dataset describing the thermal isomerisation of alpha-pinene.",,Stephen J Wilkinson;Neil Benson;Douglas B Kell

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25927705/,A comparison of aggregate p-value methods and multivariate statistics for self-contained tests of metabolic pathway analysis,"For pathway analysis of genomic data, the most common methods involve combining p-values from individual statistical tests. However, there are several multivariate statistical methods that can be used to test whether a pathway has changed. Because of the large number of variables and pathway sizes in genomics data, some of these statistics cannot be computed. However, in metabolomics data, the number of variables and pathway sizes are typically much smaller, making such computations feasible. Of particular interest is being able to detect changes in pathways that may not be detected for the individual variables. We compare the performance of both the p-value methods and multivariate statistics for self-contained tests with an extensive simulation study and a human metabolomics study. Permutation tests, rather than asymptotic results are used to assess the statistical significance of the pathways. Furthermore, both one and two-sided alternatives hypotheses are examined. From the human metabolomic study, many pathways were statistically significant, although the majority of the individual variables in the pathway were not. Overall, the p-value methods perform at least as well as the multivariate statistics for these scenarios.",,Matthew W Mitchell

Two different chiral isomers are simultaneously present in Astacid crayfish and their specific biological functions are still poorly understood. The present study is aimed at better understanding the potentially different effect of each of the isomers on the hepatopancreatic gene expression profile in the crayfish Pontastacus leptodactylus, in the context of short term hyperglycemia. Hence, two different chemically synthesized cHH enantiomers, containing either L- or D-Phe(3), were injected to the circulation of intermolt females following removal of their X organ-Sinus gland complex. The effects triggered by the injection of the two alternate isomers were detected after one hour through measurement of circulating glucose levels. Triggered changes of the transcriptome expression profile in the hepatopancreas were analyzed by RNA-seq. A whole transcriptome shotgun sequence assembly provided the assumedly complete transcriptome of P. leptodactylus hepatopancreas, followed by RNA-seq analysis of changes in the expression level of many genes caused by the application of each of the hormone isomers. Circulating glucose levels were much higher in response to the D-isoform than to the L-isoform injection, one hour from injection. Similarly, the RNA-seq analysis confirmed a stronger effect on gene expression following the administration of D-cHH, while just limited alterations were caused by the L-isomer. These findings demonstrated a more prominent short term effect of the D-cHH on the transcription profile and shed light on the effect of the D-isomer on specific functional gene groups. Another contribution of the study is the construction of a de novo assembly of the hepatopancreas transcriptome, consisting of 39,935 contigs, that dramatically increases the molecular information available for this species and for crustaceans in general, providing an efficient tool for studying gene expression patterns in this organ.",,Chiara Manfrin;Moshe Tom;Gianluca De Moro;Marco Gerdol;Corrado Guarnaccia;Alessandro Mosco;Alberto Pallavicini;Piero Giulio Giulianini
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27071188/,Search for a Minimal Set of Parameters by Assessing the Total Optimization Potential for a Dynamic Model of a Biochemical Network,"Selecting an efficient small set of adjustable parameters to improve metabolic features of an organism is important for a reduction of implementation costs and risks of unpredicted side effects. In practice, to avoid the analysis of a huge combinatorial space for the possible sets of adjustable parameters, experience-, and intuition-based subsets of parameters are often chosen, possibly leaving some interesting counter-intuitive combinations of parameters unrevealed. The combinatorial scan of possible adjustable parameter combinations at the model optimization level is possible; however, the number of analyzed combinations is still limited. The total optimization potential (TOP) approach is proposed to assess the full potential for increasing the value of the objective function by optimizing all possible adjustable parameters. This seemingly unpractical combination of adjustable parameters allows assessing the maximum attainable value of the objective function and stopping the combinatorial space scanning when the desired fraction of TOP is reached and any further increase in the number of adjustable parameters cannot bring any reasonable improvement. The relation between the number of adjustable parameters and the reachable fraction of TOP is a valuable guideline in choosing a rational solution for industrial implementation. The TOP approach is demonstrated on the basis of two case studies.",,Egils Stalidzans;Ivars Mozga;Jurijs Sulins;Peteris Zikmanis

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17692871/,Isotopomer subspaces as indicators of metabolic-pathway structure,"The relative abundances and rates of formation of particular isotopic isomers (isotopomers) of metabolic intermediates from (13)C-labelled substrates in living cells provide information on the routes taken by the initial (13)C-atoms. When a primary substrate such as [U,(13)C] d-glucose is added to human erythrocytes, the pattern of labels in terminal metabolites is determined by a set of carbon-group exchange reactions in both glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Of a given terminal metabolite, not all possible isotopomers will be produced from each possible primary substrate isotopomer. There are only 8 different (13)C-isotopomers of lactate but not all of these are produced when one of the 64 possible (13)C-isotopomers of glucose is used as the input substrate; thus a subset of all 63 glucose isotopomers x 8 lactate isotopomers+1 unlabelled glucose x 1 unlabelled lactate=505 pattern associations, would be produced if a complete experimental analysis were performed with all the glucose variants. The pattern of labelling in this isotopomer subspace reflects the nature of the re-ordering reactions that 'direct' the metabolism. Predicting the combinatorial rearrangements for particular sets of reactions and comparing these with real data should enable conclusions to be drawn about which enzymes are involved in the real metabolic system. An example of the glycolysis-PPP system is discussed in the context of a debate that occurred around the F- and L-type PPPs and which one actually operates in the human RBC. As part of this discussion we introduce the term 'combinatorial deficit' of all possible isotopomers and we show that this deficit is less for the F- than the L-type pathway.",,Philip W Kuchel;David J Philp
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22782002/,Inferring differences in the distribution of reaction rates across conditions,"Elucidating changes in the distribution of reaction rates in metabolic pathways under different conditions is a central challenge in systems biology. Here we present a method for inferring regulation mechanisms responsible for changes in the distribution of reaction rates across conditions from correlations in time-resolved data. A reversal of correlations between conditions reveals information about regulation mechanisms. With the use of a small in silico hypothetical network, based on only the topology and directionality of a known pathway, several regulation scenarios can be formulated. Confronting these scenarios with experimental data results in a short list of possible pathway regulation mechanisms associated with the reversal of correlations between conditions. This procedure allows for the formulation of regulation scenarios without detailed prior knowledge of kinetics and for the inference of reaction rate changes without rate information. The method was applied to experimental time-resolved metabolomics data from multiple short-term perturbation-response experiments in S. cerevisiae across aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The method's output was validated against a detailed kinetic model of glycolysis in S. cerevisiae, which showed that the method can indeed infer the correct regulation scenario.",,Diana M Hendrickx;Huub C J Hoefsloot;Margriet M W B Hendriks;Daniël J Vis;André B Canelas;Bas Teusink;Age K Smilde
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26274227/,Phenotypic constraints promote latent versatility and carbon efficiency in metabolic networks,"System-level properties of metabolic networks may be the direct product of natural selection or arise as a by-product of selection on other properties. Here we study the effect of direct selective pressure for growth or viability in particular environments on two properties of metabolic networks: latent versatility to function in additional environments and carbon usage efficiency. Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling based on flux balance analysis (FBA), we sample from a known biochemical universe random viable metabolic networks that differ in the number of directly constrained environments. We find that the latent versatility of sampled metabolic networks increases with the number of directly constrained environments and with the size of the networks. We then show that the average carbon wastage of sampled metabolic networks across the constrained environments decreases with the number of directly constrained environments and with the size of the networks. Our work expands the growing body of evidence about nonadaptive origins of key functional properties of biological networks.",,Marco Bardoscia;Matteo Marsili;Areejit Samal

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17503370/,Patterns of interactions of reaction pairs in metabolic networks,A large scale structural analysis of metabolic networks is presented focusing on neighbourhood relationships between individual reactions. We define two reactions to be neighbored if one of them provides the necessary set of substances for the other to proceed. A method is developed which allows determining all possible neighborhood relationships categorized as interaction patterns. These patterns differ in the types of participating reactions and in the way they share their reactants. The method is applied to a set of 4795 metabolic reactions contained in the KEGG database. We show that from the 1547 theoretically possible types of interactions 282 patterns are found in metabolism. More than 55% of all interactions occur between reactions with at most two reactants on one side. In these interactions only 25 different patterns play a role. We propose to use these neighborhood relationships as a concept of adjacency in large scale graph theoretical analyses of metabolism.,,József Bruck;Oliver Ebenhöh;Reinhart Heinrich

Bacteriology (and possibly all biology) from an overall perspective can be researched and understood as observations and experimentations on mass and energy, which are themselves the products of evolutionary change for about 3.5-3.9 billion years. All organisms have mass, transform, store and use biochemical energy and obey the most fundamental of all laws--the laws of thermodynamics. Bacteria can be viewed as semi-permeable, thermodynamically open systems of mass, controlled by relatively small amounts of genetic instructions with lower entropy than their higher entropy, surrounding environments. Some fundamental properties describing bacterial life are also presented.",,J T Trevors
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17701402/,Proof of principle of a generalized fuzzy Hough transform approach to peak alignment of one-dimensional 1H NMR data,"In metabolic profiling, multivariate data analysis techniques are used to interpret one-dimensional (1D) 1H NMR data. Multivariate data analysis techniques require that peaks are characterised by the same variables in every spectrum. This location constraint is essential for correct comparison of the intensities of several NMR spectra. However, variations in physicochemical factors can cause the locations of the peaks to shift. The location prerequisite may thus not be met, and so, to solve this problem, alignment methods have been developed. However, current state-of-the-art algorithms for data alignment cannot resolve the inherent problems encountered when analysing NMR data of biological origin, because they are unable to align peaks when the spatial order of the peaks changes-a commonly occurring phenomenon. In this paper a new algorithm is proposed, based on the Hough transform operating on an image representation of the NMR dataset that is capable of correctly aligning peaks when existing methods fail. The proposed algorithm was compared with current state-of-the-art algorithms operating on a selected plasma dataset to demonstrate its potential. A urine dataset was also processed using the algorithm as a further demonstration. The method is capable of successfully aligning the plasma data but further development is needed to address more challenging applications, for example urine data.",,Leonard Csenki;Erik Alm;Ralf J O Torgrip;K Magnus Aberg;Lars I Nord;Ina Schuppe-Koistinen;Johan Lindberg
