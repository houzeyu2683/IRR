https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31726779/,Biomaterials in Gastroenterology: A Critical Overview,"In spite of the large diversity of diagnostic and interventional devices associated with gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures, there is little information on the impact of the biomaterials (metals, polymers) contained in these devices upon body tissues and, indirectly, upon the treatment outcomes. Other biomaterials for gastroenterology, such as adhesives and certain hemostatic agents, have been investigated to a greater extent, but the information is fragmentary. Much of this situation is due to the paucity of details disclosed by the manufacturers of the devices. Moreover, for most of the applications in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, there are no studies available on the biocompatibility of the device materials when in intimate contact with mucosae and other components of the GI tract. We have summarized the current situation with a focus on aspects of biomaterials and biocompatibility related to the device materials and other agents, with an emphasis on the GI endoscopic procedures. Procedures and devices used for the control of bleeding, for polypectomy, in bariatrics, and for stenting are discussed, particularly dwelling upon the biomaterial-related features of each application. There are indications that research is progressing steadily in this field, and the establishment of the subdiscipline of ""gastroenterologic biomaterials"" is not merely a remote projection. Upon the completion of this article, the gastroenterologist should be able to understand the nature of biomaterials and to achieve a suitable and beneficial perception of their significance in gastroenterology. Likewise, the biomaterialist should become aware of the specific tasks that the biomaterials must fulfil when placed within the GI tract, and regard such applications as both a challenge and an incentive for progressing the research in this field.",bariatric devices; biocompatibility; biomaterials; endoscopic devices; gastrointestinal tract; hemostasis; stents; surgical adhesives.,Adrian Goldis;Ramona Goldis;Traian V Chirila

OBJECTIVES Describe the history of pediatric gastroenterology's development in Cuba since its inception at the National Gastroenterology Institute in the early 1970s, its contributions, and efforts to extend it to pediatric hospitals throughout Cuba. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION This is a historical review based on document analysis. Institutional sources from the National Gastroenterology Institute and Ministry of Public Health were reviewed, as well as international and national literature on the history of pediatric gastroenterology and unpublished texts since its emergence in 1972. DEVELOPMENT Although pediatric gastroenterology has not been formally recognized as a medical specialty in Cuba, there have been important achievements in establishing a network of specialized health care services for digestive diseases of children and adolescents. Gastrointestinal endoscopy and other auxiliary diagnostic modalities have been introduced for children and play a major role in clinical trials and research. This article describes the international context that promoted the specialty's development in Cuba. Reference is made to specialized training from its initial stages in 1972, its consolidation as an emerging discipline in Cuban medicine, and its diffusion in Latin American and Caribbean countries. Professional development and specialized training to meet health human resource needs in pediatric hospitals are described, as well as Cuban participation in the Latin American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition. National and international milestones, publications, awards and recognitions that indicate advances despite difficulties are also presented. CONCLUSIONS Since 1972, there have been major strides in the development of pediatric gastroenterology practice in Cuba. The establishment of a national network of specialized services in pediatric hospitals throughout Cuba has provided quality health care for digestive diseases of childhood. Pediatric gastroenterology's development and achievements in healthcare and research are such that it deserves official recognition as a medical specialty Cuba.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32022720/,ACG Clinical Guideline: Chronic Pancreatitis,"Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is historically defined as an irreversible inflammatory condition of the pancreas leading to varying degrees of exocrine and endocrine dysfunction. Recently however, the paradigm for the diagnosis has changed in that it breaks with the traditional clinicopathologic-based definition of disease, focusing instead on diagnosing the underlying pathologic process early in the disease course and managing the syndrome more holistically to change the natural course of disease and minimize adverse disease effects. Currently, the most accepted mechanistically derived definition of CP is a pathologic fibroinflammatory syndrome of the pancreas in individuals with genetic, environmental, and/or other risk factors who develop persistent pathologic responses to parenchymal injury or stress. The most common symptom of CP is abdominal pain, with other symptoms such as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and diabetes developing at highly variable rates. CP is most commonly caused by toxins such as alcohol or tobacco use, genetic polymorphisms, and recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis, although no history of acute pancreatitis is seen in many patients. Diagnosis is made usually on cross-sectional imaging, with modalities such as endoscopic ultrasonography and pancreatic function tests playing a secondary role. Total pancreatectomy represents the only known cure for CP, although difficulty in patient selection and the complications inherent to this intervention make it usually an unattractive option. This guideline will provide an evidence-based practical approach to the diagnosis and management of CP for the general gastroenterologist.",,Timothy B Gardner;Douglas G Adler;Chris E Forsmark;Bryan G Sauer;Jason R Taylor;David C Whitcomb

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28073146/,Value-based care in hepatology,"The migration from legacy fee-for-service reimbursement to payments linked to high-value health care is accelerating in the United States because of new legislation and redesign of payments from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Because patients with chronic diseases account for substantial use of health care resources, payers and health systems are focusing on maximizing the value of care for these patients. Because chronic liver diseases impose a major health burden worldwide affecting the health and lives of many individuals and families as well as substantial costs for individuals and payers, hepatologists must understand how they can improve their practices. Hepatologists practice a high-intensity cognitive subspecialty, using complex and costly procedures and medications. High-value patient care requires multidisciplinary coordination, labor-intensive support for critically ill patients, and effective chronic disease management. Under current fee-for-service reimbursement, patient values, medical success, and financial success can all be misaligned. Many current attempts to link health outcomes to reimbursement are based on compliance with process measures, with less emphasis on outcomes that matter most to patients, thus slowing transformation to higher-value team-based care. Outcome measures that reflect the entire cycle of care are needed to assist both clinicians and administrators in improving the quality and value of care. A comprehensive set of outcome measures for liver diseases is not currently available. Numerous researchers now are attempting to fill this gap by devising and testing outcome indicators and patient-reported outcomes for the major liver conditions. These indicators will provide tools to implement a value-based approach for patients with chronic liver diseases to compare results and value of care between referral centers, to perform health technology assessment, and to guide decision-making processes for health authorities. This review sets the groundwork for implementing a value-based, patient-centered approach to chronic liver diseases within a health system.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32107677/,Evolving Role and Future Directions of Natural Language Processing in Gastroenterology,"In line with the current trajectory of healthcare reform, significant emphasis has been placed on improving the utilization of data collected during a clinical encounter. Although the structured fields of electronic health records have provided a convenient foundation on which to begin such efforts, it was well understood that a substantial portion of relevant information is confined in the free-text narratives documenting care. Unfortunately, extracting meaningful information from such narratives is a non-trivial task, traditionally requiring significant manual effort. Today, computational approaches from a field known as Natural Language Processing (NLP) are poised to make a transformational impact in the analysis and utilization of these documents across healthcare practice and research, particularly in procedure-heavy sub-disciplines such as gastroenterology (GI). As such, this manuscript provides a clinically focused review of NLP systems in GI practice. It begins with a detailed synopsis around the state of NLP techniques, presenting state-of-the-art methods and typical use cases in both clinical settings and across other domains. Next, it will present a robust literature review around current applications of NLP within four prominent areas of gastroenterology including endoscopy, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreaticobiliary, and liver diseases.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16981073/,[Ultrasound in gastroenterology--liver and spleen],"Conventional B-mode and colour duplex imaging is the first choice imaging technique after history taking and physical examination and for the interpretation of laboratory parameters. In the hands of a gastroenterologist ultrasound has become an equally important diagnostic tool as endoscopy. The constantly evolving technique with its possibility of higher resolution by use of ""harmonic imaging"" and signal enhancement with contrast medium is the reason for a practically relevant review of the situation. Practical references will be given for diagnostics of the liver and portal system including the spleen. The significance of the sonographic diagnosis of ""fatty liver"" is critically discussed. The overall importance of ultrasound to distinguish different aetiologies of diffuse liver diseases is relatively low. Nevertheless, it is a very sensitive means to detect complications of liver cirrhosis. Portosystemic shunts and typical changes in blood vessel morphology can be diagnosed by colour duplex sonography and used as indirect signs of advanced damage to liver parenchyma. In addition, ultrasound has its value in the confirmation or exclusion of dilated bile ducts as well as in the detection and differentiation of circumscribed liver lesions. The characterisation of focal liver lesions by ultrasound is sufficient in typical cases. The use of ultrasound contrast media (signal enhancers) raises the rate of differentiation and can avoid the uncritical and sequential application of radiological imaging (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). If in doubt about the nature of a lesion, a histological diagnosis remains indispensable. The examination of the spleen and its feeding vessels is regularly done in cases of diffuse parenchymal liver disease when searching for its complications, e. g., portal hypertension. Focal spleen lesions can be observed especially in the context of lymphoma (infiltration) and other bone marrow diseases. Through the application of contrast media, changes of vascularisation (e. g., infarcts) can be visualised and traumatic lesions can be diagnosed more precisely.",,D Nuernberg;A Ignee;C F Dietrich
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28484687/,Gastroenterology Curriculum in the Canadian Medical School System,"Background and Purpose. Gastroenterology is a diverse subspecialty that covers a wide array of topics. The preclinical gastroenterology curriculum is often the only formal training that medical students receive prior to becoming residents. There is no Canadian consensus on learning objectives or instructional methods and a general lack of awareness of curriculum at other institutions. This results in variable background knowledge for residents and lack of guidance for course development. Objectives. (1) Elucidate gastroenterology topics being taught at the preclinical level. (2) Determine instructional methods employed to teach gastroenterology content. Results. A curriculum map of gastroenterology topics was constructed from 10 of the medical schools that responded. Topics often not taught included pediatric GI diseases, surgery and trauma, food allergies/intolerances, and obesity. Gastroenterology was taught primarily by gastroenterologists and surgeons. Didactic and small group teaching was the most employed teaching method. Conclusion. This study is the first step in examining the Canadian gastroenterology curriculum at a preclinical level. The data can be used to inform curriculum development so that topics generally lacking are better incorporated in the curriculum.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29702296/,Advances in Management of Esophageal Motility Disorders,"The widespread adoption of high-resolution manometry (HRM) has led to a restructuring in the classification of esophageal motility disorder classification summarized in the Chicago Classification, currently in version 3.0. It has become apparent that the cardinal feature of achalasia, impaired lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, can occur in several disease phenotypes: without peristalsis, with premature (spastic) distal esophageal contractions, with panesophageal pressurization, or even with preserved peristalsis. Furthermore, despite these advances in diagnostics, no single manometric pattern is perfectly sensitive or specific for idiopathic achalasia and complimentary assessments with provocative maneuvers during HRM or interrogating the esophagogastric junction with the functional luminal imaging probe during endoscopy can be useful in clarifying equivocal or inexplicable HRM findings. Using these tools, we have come to conceptualize esophageal motility disorders as characterized by obstructive physiology at the esophagogastric junction, smooth muscle esophagus, or both. Recognizing obstructive physiology as a primary target of therapy has become particularly relevant with the development of a minimally invasive technique for performing a calibrated myotomy of the esophageal circular muscle, the POEM procedure. Now and going forward, optimal management is to render treatment in a phenotype-specific manner: e.g. POEM calibrated to patient-specific physiology for spastic achalasia and spastic disorders of the smooth muscle esophagus, more conservative strategies (pneumatic dilation) for the disorders limited to the sphincter.",Dysphagia; Esophageal Motility Disorders; Esophagus; High-Resolution Manometry.,Peter J Kahrilas;Albert J Bredenoord;Dustin A Carlson;John E Pandolfino

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16456761/,[Perspectives of cannabinoids in gastroenterology],"In early cultures, extracts of the plant Cannabis sativa were medically used for the treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. In the United States cannabis extracts were frequently used as drugs, e. g., for the treatment of diarrhoea, until around 1920. The possibility of cannabis abuse resulted in a worldwide prohibition and thus the temporary ending of the medical use of cannabinoids. The characterisation of an endogenous cannabinoid system consisting of receptors, endogenous agonists, antagonists and degrading enzymes opens the door for a comeback of cannabinoids in medicine. The clinically proven effects in the treatment of pain, cachexia in conjunction with HIV, or malignant disease and treatment of nausea and vomiting in conjunction with chemotherapy now result in the prescription of cannabinoids as valuable medication. This review will discuss the value of cannabinoids in the treatment of nausea and vomiting, i. e., the indications for which cannabinoids are presently used in gastroenterology. Additionally, this review will discuss potential indications within gastroenterology, where results from basic research or individual observations suggest that a future use of cannabinoids in gastroenterology seems possible.",,M Storr;B Yüce;B Göke
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9195395/,Development of gastroenterology in Bangladesh,"Diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and liver are very common in Bangladesh. Gastroenterology as a dedicated specialty was initiated in 1977 at the Institute of Postgraduate Medicine and Research in Dhaka. One more centre was set up later and these centres are providing specialized diagnostic and therapeutic services. These centres are also imparting training in endoscopy and 49 endoscopists trained so far are providing services in 22 centres around the country. Clinical gastroenterologists are also being trained in a 3 year Master's degree course and three specialists have already completed this. A Gastroenterology Society was formed in 1988 and has held three national scientific conferences and 20 regional meetings. Research in special problems of the country has also been initiated and work on aspects of peptic ulcer disease, chronic calcific pancreatitis and chronic viral hepatitis has been conducted. The demand for gastrointestinal services is high and the specialty has attracted a good number of young doctors.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26122765/,Shifting Away From Fee-For-Service: Alternative Approaches to Payment in Gastroenterology,"Fee-for-service payments encourage high-volume services rather than high-quality care. Alternative payment models (APMs) aim to realign financing to support high-value services. The 2 main components of gastroenterologic care, procedures and chronic care management, call for a range of APMs. The first step for gastroenterologists is to identify the most important conditions and opportunities to improve care and reduce waste that do not require financial support. We describe examples of delivery reforms and emerging APMs to accomplish these care improvements. A bundled payment for an episode of care, in which a provider is given a lump sum payment to cover the cost of services provided during the defined episode, can support better care for a discrete procedure such as a colonoscopy. Improved management of chronic conditions can be supported through a per-member, per-month (PMPM) payment to offer extended services and care coordination. For complex chronic conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, in which the gastroenterologist is the principal care coordinator, the PMPM payment could be given to a gastroenterology medical home. For conditions in which the gastroenterologist acts primarily as a consultant for primary care, such as noncomplex gastroesophageal reflux or hepatitis C, a PMPM payment can support effective care coordination in a medical neighborhood delivery model. Each APM can be supplemented with a shared savings component. Gastroenterologists must engage with and be early leaders of these redesign discussions to be prepared for a time when APMs may be more prevalent and no longer voluntary.","Bundled Payments; Health Care Reform; Medical Home; Per-Member, Per-Month.",Kavita Patel;Elise Presser;Meaghan George;Mark McClellan

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8409324/,Implications for the ligase chain reaction in gastroenterology,"The ligase chain reaction (LCR) is a new DNA detection method that uses thermostable ligase to discriminate exquisitely and amplify single base changes in genes of medical interest. This enzyme specifically links two adjacent oligonucleotides when hybridized to a complementary target only when the nucleotides are perfectly base-paired at the junction. Oligonucleotide products are exponentially amplified by thermal cycling of the ligation reaction in the presence of a second set of adjacent oligonucleotides, complementary to the first set and the target. A single-base mismatch prevents ligation and amplification, thus distinguishing a single base mutation from the normal allele. The use of a thermostable ligase allows the enzyme to survive thermal cycling in a fashion analogous to Taq polymerase in the polymerase chain reaction. The assay is compatible with nonradioactive detection and has the potential for automation.

It addresses the removal of foreign bodies in the upper gastrointestinal tract in adults. Recommendations Nonendoscopic measures 1 ESGE recommends diagnostic evaluation based on the patient's history and symptoms. ESGE recommends a physical examination focused on the patient's general condition and to assess signs of any complications (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). 2 ESGE does not recommend radiological evaluation for patients with nonbony food bolus impaction without complications. We recommend plain radiography to assess the presence, location, size, configuration, and number of ingested foreign bodies if ingestion of radiopaque objects is suspected or type of object is unknown (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). 3 ESGE recommends computed tomography (CT) scan in all patients with suspected perforation or other complication that may require surgery (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). 4 ESGE does not recommend barium swallow, because of the risk of aspiration and worsening of the endoscopic visualization (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). 5 ESGE recommends clinical observation without the need for endoscopic removal for management of asymptomatic patients with ingestion of blunt and small objects (except batteries and magnets). If feasible, outpatient management is appropriate (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). 6 ESGE recommends close observation in asymptomatic individuals who have concealed packets of drugs by swallowing (""body packing""). We recommend against endoscopic retrieval. We recommend surgical referral in cases of suspected packet rupture, failure of packets to progress, or intestinal obstruction (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). Endoscopic measures 7 ESGE recommends emergent (preferably within 2 hours, but at the latest within 6 hours) therapeutic esophagogastroduodenoscopy for foreign bodies inducing complete esophageal obstruction, and for sharp-pointed objects or batteries in the esophagus. We recommend urgent (within 24 hours) therapeutic esophagogastroduodenoscopy for other esophageal foreign bodies without complete obstruction (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). 8 ESGE suggests treatment of food bolus impaction in the esophagus by gently pushing the bolus into the stomach. If this procedure is not successful, retrieval should be considered (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). The effectiveness of medical treatment of esophageal food bolus impaction is debated. It is therefore recommended, that medical treatment should not delay endoscopy (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). 9 In cases of food bolus impaction, ESGE recommends a diagnostic work-up for potential underlying disease, including histological evaluation, in addition to therapeutic endoscopy (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). 10 ESGE recommends urgent (within 24 hours) therapeutic esophagogastroduodenoscopy for foreign bodies in the stomach such as sharp-pointed objects, magnets, batteries and large/long objects. We suggest nonurgent (within 72 hours) therapeutic esophagogastroduodenoscopy for medium-sized blunt foreign bodies in the stomach (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). 11 ESGE recommends the use of a protective device in order to avoid esophagogastric/pharyngeal damage and aspiration during endoscopic extraction of sharp-pointed foreign bodies. Endotracheal intubation should be considered in the case of high risk of aspiration (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). 12 ESGE suggests the use of suitable extraction devices according to the type and location of the ingested foreign body (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). 13 After successful and uncomplicated endoscopic removal of ingested foreign bodies, ESGE suggests that the patient may be discharged. If foreign bodies are not or cannot be removed, a case-by-case approach depending on the size and type of the foreign body is suggested (weak recommendation, low quality evidence).",,Michael Birk;Peter Bauerfeind;Pierre H Deprez;Michael Häfner;Dirk Hartmann;Cesare Hassan;Tomas Hucl;Gilles Lesur;Lars Aabakken;Alexander Meining

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21633594/,Gastroenterology training in Latin America,"Latin America is characterized by ethnic, geographical, cultural, and economic diversity; therefore, training in gastroenterology in the region must be considered in this context. The continent's medical education is characterized by a lack of standards and the volume of research continues to be relatively small. There is a multiplicity of events in general gastroenterology and in sub-disciplines, both at regional and local levels, which ensure that many colleagues have access to information. Medical education programs must be based on a clinical vision and be considered in close contact with the patients. The programs should be properly supervised, appropriately defined, and evaluated on a regular basis. The disparity between the patients' needs, the scarce resources available, and the pressures exerted by the health systems on doctors are frequent cited by those complaining of poor professionalism. Teaching development can play a critical role in ensuring the quality of teaching and learning in universities. Continuing professional development programs activities must be planned on the basis of the doctors' needs, with clearly defined objectives and using proper learning methodologies designed for adults. They must be evaluated and accredited by a competent body, so that they may become the basis of a professional regulatory system. The specialty has made progress in the last decades, offering doctors various possibilities for professional development. The world gastroenterology organization has contributed to the speciality through three distinctive, but closely inter-related, programs: Training Centers, Train-the-Trainers, and Global Guidelines, in which Latin America is deeply involved.",Gastroenterology; Latin America; Training.,Henry Cohen;Roque Saenz;Luiz E de Almeida Troncon;Maribel Lizarzabal;Carolina Olano

While there have been significant efforts to develop quality metrics that ensure high-value care of these patients, wide variations in clinical practice exist. In this opinion review, we discuss the quality gap in the care of patients with cirrhosis, including low levels of compliance with recommended cancer screening and other clinical outcome and patient-reported outcome measures. We posit that innovations in telemedicine and mobile health (mHealth) should play a key role in closing the quality gaps in liver disease management. We highlight interventions that have been performed to date in liver disease and heart failure-from successful teleconsultation interventions in the care of veterans with cirrhosis to the use of telemonitoring to reduce hospital readmissions and decrease mortality rates in heart failure. Telemedicine and mHealth can effectively address unmet needs in the care of patients with cirrhosis by increasing preventative care, expanding outreach to rural communities, and increasing high-value care. We aim to highlight the benefits of investing in innovative solutions in telemedicine and mHealth to improve care for patients with cirrhosis and create downstream cost savings.",Cirrhosis; Liver disease; Mobile health; Quality improvement; Telemedicine; Telemonitoring.,Matthew Jonathon Stotts;Justin Alexander Grischkan;Vandana Khungar

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8580264/,Review article: drug development in gastroenterology--the changing view of industry,"Rationalization within the pharmaceutical industry to combat escalating costs has included the close examination of research portfolios. Gastroenterology has been one of the casualties of this exercise and few companies currently retain a specific gastrointestinal research programme. Acid-peptic disease has been the victim of its own success, since the availability of a range of extremely effective drugs largely satisfies current medical needs. A safe, convenient and effective monotherapy able to eradicate Helicobacter pylori would be a commercially viable alternative to antisecretory drugs, leading to further expansion of the anti-ulcer market. The irritable bowel syndrome is probably too diverse a target for logical research: inflammatory bowel disease is probably too small a market to be attractive. Potentially effective drugs to treat these and other gastrointestinal diseases could emerge from broader research programmes, provided that companies retain the expertise and desire to develop such agents for gastrointestinal indications. Cancer of the gastrointestinal tract and associated organs undoubtedly represents a commercially attractive target, but new anti-tumour drugs are more likely to arise from generic research rather than programmes specifically directed at tumours of the gastrointestinal tract. The changing view of the pharmaceutical industry towards the development of gastrointestinal drugs is likely to have a negative impact on both fundamental and clinical research in gastroenterology.",,M E Parsons;A Garner

Although pediatric gastroenterology fellows are expected to obtain training in the diagnosis and management of patients with these disorders, there is an ongoing concern for unmet needs and lack of exposure and standardized curriculum. In the context of tailoring training components, outcome and expressed needs of pediatric gastroenterology fellows and programs, members of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) and American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society (ANMS) developed guidelines for NGM training in North America in line with specific expectations and goals of training as delineated through already established entrustable professional activities (EPAs). Members of the joint task force applied their expertise to identify the components of knowledge, skills, and management, which are expected of NGM consultants.

At the 2017 Annual North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition meeting, the Pancreas Committee held a full day symposium on pediatric pancreatic diseases, entitled, ""Frontiers in Pediatric Pancreatology."" The symposium served as a timely and novel academic meeting that brought together individuals with a vested interest in the care of children with pancreatic disorders. The objective of this day-long course was to update practicing gastroenterologists on the latest advances in research, management algorithms, endoscopic therapies, radiographic resources, surgical approaches, and novel drug therapies targeted to pediatric pancreatitis. Presentations were divided into 4 modules: diagnosis, risk factors, and natural history of pancreatitis; pancreatic imaging and exocrine function; management of pancreatitis; and new frontiers in pediatric pancreatitis research. The course fostered a unique ecosystem for interdisciplinary collaboration, in addition to promoting discussion and stimulating new research hypotheses regarding pediatric pancreatic disorders. Oral presentations by experts in various fields of pancreatology led to thought-provoking discussion; in addition, a meet-the-professor luncheon stimulated critical evaluation of current research in pediatric pancreatic diseases, highlighting knowledge gaps and future research endeavors.

Gastroenterology has in the last 50 years evolved into a major specialty, covering not only complex clinical and diagnostic areas, but inclusive of sophisticated investigative work and major therapeutic endoscopic technology. Unfortunately, the evolution of gastrointestinal surgery has lagged behind. The scope of the gastrointestinal surgeon has become more limited, as potent pharmacotherapeutic probes, invasive radiological techniques and diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic advances have been implemented. The development of minimally invasive surgical techniques has introduced a new era in surgical management. However, the establishment of new training programs and the acquisition of skills requiring the acquisition of costly equipment are major issues which surgical departments need to address. A novel training and programmatic configuration for the group of physicians involved in the management of gastrointestinal disease is required to meet this challenge. In particular, internists and surgeons must focus on the development of cost and time effective strategies for the management of clinical gastrointestinal disease.

This system provided a single point of entry model (SEM) for referrals rather than the traditional system of individual practitioners managing their own referrals and queues. The goal of central triage was to improve wait times and referral management. In 2008, a similar system was developed in Edmonton at the University of Alberta Hospital (Edmonton, Alberta). SEMs have subsequently been adopted by numerous subspecialties throughout Alberta. There are many benefits of SEMs including improved access and reduced wait times. Understanding and measuring complex patient flow systems is key to improving access, and centralized intake systems provide an opportunity to better understand total demand and system bottlenecks. This knowledge is particularly important for specialties such as gastroenterology (GI), in which demand exceeds supply.

The requirements for being acknowledged as a specialist vary from 1 1/2 to 4 years of training and education in gastroenterology in addition to 1-6 years of training and education in internal medicine/surgery. The requirement of theoretical education varying from 40 to 300 h is practiced in some countries only. In some countries training in endoscopy is separated from gastroenterology. A formal examination and post-specialization training program is required in only some of the countries answering the questionnaire. The number of centres per million inhabitants recognized for training and education also varied greatly. The number of specialists per million inhabitants was 3.6 to 15. In the Middle and Far East the organisation of gastroenterology was much inferior to that in Europe and North America because of insufficient education and organization programs and lack of economic support to perform them. The answers from the gastroenterological associations and personal reporters agreed on the following: A speciality in medical and surgical gastroenterology should be established in all countries around the world. Programs for training and education should be agreed upon in recognized teaching and training institutions of gastroenterology, probably of 3 years' duration in combination with a speciality in internal medicine. A gastroenterologist will in most cases be dealing with other diseases as well.

Two-thirds of these physicians regard their post as that of general physician with a special interest in gastroenterology and a quarter as general physician. Very few physicians (nine) practise gastroenterology alone. Most physicians devote between three and six sessions to gastroenterology; this time is divided between inpatient care, outpatient consultation, and endoscopy in roughly equal proportions. Most physicians spend one to two sessions performing endoscopy. Nearly all district general hospitals, except the smallest with a staff of two or three physicians, have a physician with a special interest in gastroenterology on their staff. Some district general hospitals and most university hospitals have two such physicians. The number of likely consultant vacancies by retirement on grounds of age is small in the next five years (14) and then rises progressively, reaching about eight per annum in 1991-95 and more than 10 per annum thereafter. There are about 90 trainees of senior registrar status who aspire to a career as consultant physician with a special interest in gastroenterology, or an academic career in gastroenterology, distributed throughout the country. There are also eight trainees of senior registrar status who wish to obtain a post as general physician with gastroenterology as one of two or more special interests. There are known to be about 70 trainees of registrar status who wish to train in general medicine with a special interest in gastroenterology and another 24 who wish to make gastroenterology one of their special interests.",,Committee on Gastroenterology of the Royal College of Physicians (London)

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31701137/,Is Crohn's Disease a Rightly Used Eponym?,"In 1932 Burrill B. Crohn, a gastroenterologist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, described, together with two surgical colleagues, a series of 14 patients with an inflammatory condition of the terminal ileum. All patients were operated on by Dr Albert Berg, the Chief Surgeon of the hospital, whose name did not appear on the initial publication. The 'new' disease was called 'regional ileitis', but was rapidly referred to as 'Crohn's disease'. From earlier accounts and publications it has become clear that the condition had already existed for many centuries and was 'discovered' several times before 1932, most notably by Giovanni Morgagni in 1769, Antoni Lesniowski in 1903 and Thomas K. Dalziel in 1913. 'Crohn's disease' might reasonably be known by another eponym. Nevertheless, the 1932 publication of Crohn was pivotal, as were his later contributions to the knowledge of 'his' disease. Therefore the worldwide use of the eponym is rightly to be continued. Present researchers and clinicians with an interest in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] might learn from the complicated story summarised in this contribution. Apart from an interesting historical overview, there are some lessons for today: the importance of thorough clinical observation and pattern recognition, the need for communication between colleagues and multidisciplinary approaches, and the need for broad access to valuable data, past or present, regardless of the journal or language of publication. It should ultimately bring us some humility, despite great achievements in treating this chronic disease, which defies all our efforts yet to find a cure.",Crohn’s disease; eponym; history.,Philippe Van Hootegem;Simon Travis

L. Panum et al.). The antitoxic function of the liver has been investigated by I. P. Pawlow in 1893. At the turn of the last century the theory of ""auto-intoxication"" (C. Bouchard, I. I. Metschnikoff et al.) was well known, but there were also first systematic studies of the facultatively pathogenic intestinal bacteria (T. Escherich, H. Tissier, J. Strasburger). In the twenties of our century V. van der Reis and L. Bogendoerfer worked out important fundamentals of human gastrointestinal microecology. Endotoxins as component of cellular wall of gram-negative bacteria are found by A. Boivin et al., J. W. Walker et al. First applicable proof for the detection of endotoxins was the pyrogen test with rabbits. The Limulus amoebocyte lysate test (J. Levin and F. B.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16865585/,The effect of Nazism on medical progress in gastroenterology: the inefficiency of evil,"While Nazism is almost universally recognized as a great evil, control of science and medicine by the totalitarian Nazi state might be viewed as increasing efficiency. Scientific methods are applied to semiquantitatively analyze the effects of Nazism on medical progress in gastroenterology to document its pernicious effects, and to honor outstanding gastroenterologists persecuted or murdered by the Nazis. This is a retrospective, quasi-case-controlled study. To disprove the null hypothesis that Nazism was efficient, retarded progress in gastroenterology is demonstrated by (1) enumerating the loss to Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1944 due to violent death, incarceration, or forced exile of key researchers in gastroenterology, defined by authorship of at least one book or 10 articles in peer-reviewed journals or other outstanding scholarship; (2) demonstrating a statistically significantly greater loss in Nazi Germany than in non-Nazi (Weimar German Republic from 1921 to 1932) or anti-Nazi (democratic America from 1933 to 1944) control groups; and (3) demonstrating that each loss was directly due to Nazism (murder, incarceration, or exile due to documented threat of violence/death or revocation of medical license). Sources of error in analyzing events from 70 years ago are described. Nazi Germany and Nazi-occupied Europe gained 0 and lost 53 key gastroenterology researchers, including 32 lost due to forced exile, 11 murdered by the Nazis, 5 lost due to suicide under threat of violence, 3 in hiding from the Gestapo, and 2 for other reasons. Fifty-two of the gastroenterologists were persecuted solely because they were Jewish or of Jewish descent and one because he was a Christian anti-Nazi Polish patriot. Particularly severe losses occurred in endoscopy. The loss in Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1944 was significantly greater than that in non-Nazi Germany and Austria from 1921 to 1932 (53 versus 4; odds ratio = 25.27; 95% CI: 9.01-70.48; P < 0.0001) and was significantly greater than that in anti-Nazi America from 1933 to 1944 (53 versus 0; odds ratio > 104.0; 95% CI: 17.62-608.95; P < 0.0001). Lost physicians in Nazi Germany (with reasons for loss) included Ismar Boas, the father of modern gastroenterology (suicide after medical license revoked); Hans Popper, the father of hepatopathology (fled impending arrest); Rudolph Nissen, the father of antireflux surgery (fled after job dismissal); Rudolph Schindler, the father of semiflexible endoscopy (fled after incarceration); Heinrich Lamm, the first to experimentally demonstrate fiberoptic transmission and the first to suggest its applicability for gastroscopy (fled after medical license revoked); Hermann Strauss, a pioneer in rigid sigmoidoscopy (suicide in a concentration camp); A.A.H. van den Bergh, who discovered the van den Bergh reaction to differentiate indirect from direct bilirubin (died in hiding in Nazi-occupied Holland); and Kurt Isselbacher, subsequently the Chief of Gastroenterology at Harvard Medical School (fled in childhood after a grandfather murdered by Nazis). All four refugee physicians who were reexposed to Nazi domination, after a regime change in their country of refuge, fled again or committed suicide. The Nazi damage to German and Austrian gastroenterology was immense, e.g., 13 of 14 major international discoveries in diagnostic gastroscopy were made by Germans or Austrians before the Third Reich, versus only 1 of 8 subsequently (odds ratio = 91; 95% CI: 3.58-13,887.61; P < 0.001). Eighteen (34%) of the persecuted physicians immigrated to America, thereby contributing to the postwar flourishing of American gastroenterology, particularly gastrointestinal endoscopy. In conclusion, the Third Reich severely retarded and reversed medical progress in gastroenterology in Germany. The inefficiency of Nazism, as herein documented, is attributable to the Nazi commitment of so much human, economic, and social resources to the military to wage wars of aggression, to the secret police (Gestapo) to pursue and exterminate perceived internal enemies, and to the Party to control and regiment civil society. Most inefficient is the incarceration, exile, or murder of Germany's most trained physicians and talented researchers because of religion or race, sociological parameters that are irrelevant to productivity. Intimidation and repression stifle scientific scholarship and creativity. This work disproves the myth of the efficiency of Nazism, and like tyrannies, by the novel application of semiquantitative scientific methodology to assess causality in medical history.",,Mitchell S Cappell
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10677773/,Gastroenterology and hepatology as subspecialties,"Gastroenterology grew as a subspecialty in Germany in the 19th century. In the 1880s and 1890s, Austrian and German clinics were attended by American physicians who, on returning to the U.S., founded the American Gastroenterological Association in 1897. The creation of a subspecialty board, however, had to wait until 1941. At The Mount Sinai Hospital, Dr. A.A. Berg was appointed Surgeon in 1899. His practice focused on the alimentary tract, which in 1910 became one of the four surgical specialties. In 1914, further subdivision led to the stomach and duodenum becoming additional specialties. In 1917, wards were endowed for Dr. Berg's specialty. The first Mount Sinai physician to have an interest in gastroenterology was Morris Manges, but the first to limit his practice to gastroenterology was Dr. Edward Aronson, for whom a specialist outpatient division was formed in 1913. Aronson died in 1922 and was succeeded by Dr. Burrill Crohn, who was followed in 1934 by Dr. Asher Winkelstein; all three collaborated closely with the surgeons, physiologists and biochemists. In 1958, Dr. Henry Janowitz became chief of the Division of Gastroenterology; he was succeeded in 1983 by Dr. David Sachar, who was followed in 1999 by his associate Dr. Steven Itzkowitz.

Currently, radiopaque markers, scintigraphy, and a colonic pH-pressure capsule are used to measure overall colonic transit.

Patients with gastrointestinal malignancies or advanced non-malignant liver disease represent an important group that benefits from palliative care. Approximately 80 % of all palliative care patients suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms and endoscopic procedures performed by gastroenterologists play an important role in relieving symptoms such as obstruction. It is the object of this paper to evaluate the role of gastroenterologists in palliative medicine. It will give a brief definition, a historical review and the current legal background for palliative care in Germany and examine special aspects of ethics, decision making and research. Considering the current evidence on palliative endoscopic procedures this paper wants to establish the role of the gastroenterologist in palliative care far beyond the mere practicalities of endoscopy.

ESPGHAN: 50 Years Memories-The Early Years,"Thirty-six founding members from Europe were present in 1968, when the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology (ESGA) had its first meeting in Paris. The aim was to create a forum for presentations and discussions of research activities in paediatric gastroenterology in Europe. At the second meeting of ESGA 1969 in Interlaken, an important landmark was set for all gastroenterologists in the world. In this conference, the first ever criteria for ""the Diagnosis of Coeliac Disease"" (CD) were established. In 1990, the revised criteria for the diagnosis of CD were published. After the introduction of new noninvasive techniques, like tissue transglutaminase 2-antibodies and the HLADQ2/HLADQ8 determinations in blood, ""new"" criteria for the diagnosis of CD were published in 2012 by the European society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN). Close collaboration of ESPGHAN and the North American Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition led to mutual meetings. The first combined meeting was 1978 in Paris, followed by meetings in New York, Amsterdam, Houston, and last in Toulouse. The first World Congress of Paediatric Gastroenterology took place in Boston 2000 followed by congresses in Paris, Iguazu, Taipeh, and Toronto. The creation of specialised committees (Nutrition Committees, GI-Committee, and Hepatology-Committee) enabled the society to elaborate numerous guidelines for standards in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases within the subspecialties. The Journal of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, as organ of ESPGHAN and the North American Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition since 1991, serves as the voice for these worldwide accepted guidelines. Growing educational activities with summer schools, the Young Investigator Forum and the creation of working groups have distributed our current knowledge among the younger generation and led to fruitful reports, guidelines, and syllabus. In 1992, ESPGHAN was 1 of the founding 7 members of the United European Gastroenterology Federation (UEGF), which developed into a successful organisation for gastroenterology in Europe.

Thanks to the availability of sensitive technologies for breath analysis, this empiric approach has recently gained increasing attention in the context of hepatology, following the good results obtained in other fields of medicine. After the first studies that led to the identification of selected VOCs for pathophysiological purposes, subsequent research has progressively turned towards the comprehensive assessment of exhaled breath for potential clinical application. Specific VOC patterns were found to discriminate subjects with liver cirrhosis, to rate disease severity, and, eventually, to forecast adverse clinical outcomes even beyond existing scores. Preliminary results suggest that breath analysis could be useful also for detecting and staging hepatic encephalopathy and for predicting steatohepatitis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, clinical translation is still hampered by a number of methodological limitations, including the lack of standardization and the consequent poor comparability between studies and the absence of external validation of obtained results. Given the low-cost and easy execution at bedside of the new technologies (e-nose), larger and well-structured studies are expected in order to provide the adequate level of evidence to support VOC analysis in clinical practice.",Breath print; Electronic nose; Exhaled breath analysis; Gas chromatography; Hepatic encephalopathy; Liver cirrhosis; Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.,Antonio De Vincentis;Umberto Vespasiani-Gentilucci;Anna Sabatini;Raffaele Antonelli-Incalzi;Antonio Picardi

Big Data in health care are defined as large datasets that are collected routinely or automatically, and stored electronically. With the rapidly expanding volume of health data collection, it is envisioned that the Big Data approach can improve not only individual health, but also the performance of health care systems. The application of Big Data analysis in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology research has also opened new research approaches. While it retains most of the advantages and avoids some of the disadvantages of traditional observational studies (case-control and prospective cohort studies), it allows for phenomapping of disease heterogeneity, enhancement of drug safety, as well as development of precision medicine, prediction models and personalized treatment. Unlike randomized controlled trials, it reflects the real-world situation and studies patients who are often under-represented in randomized controlled trials. However, residual and/or unmeasured confounding remains a major concern, which requires meticulous study design and various statistical adjustment methods. Other potential drawbacks include data validity, missing data, incomplete data capture due to the unavailability of diagnosis codes for certain clinical situations, and individual privacy.

Later, as a staff gastroenterologist at the Orange County General Hospital in California, I was interested in the possible role of blood flow alterations in peptic ulcer disease. We adapted Silvio Baez's just described in vivo microscopy technique to study blood flow in the gastric microcirculation in the anesthetized cat. In 1969, I joined the Gastroenterology Service at the West Los Angeles Veterans Administration (VA), primarily because of the presence there of Dr Morton Grossman, one of the leading researchers in gastrointestinal physiology. The most important lesson I learned from Dr Grossman was the importance of openness--investigators sharing their ideas, thoughts, and findings. Dr Harold Wayland, Professor, California Institute of Technology, helped me in setting up my laboratory at the VA and arranged with his friend Dr Masaharu Tsuchiya, Chair of Gastroenterology at Keio University, Tokyo, Japan, for a collaborative effort with fellows from Keio coming for 2-year fellowships with us (under my grant). Harold introduced us to the fluorescein-labeled albumen technique for the study of microvascular permeability. Later, Dr Jonathon Kaunitz, a colleague at the VA, and Kotaro Kaneko, my Keio University fellow, succeeded in modifying this technique to measure pHi in surface gastric cells in vivo. When I retired in 1993, Dr Kaunitz took charge of my laboratory. He and his associate Dr Akiba have completed extensive studies comparing and contrasting how stomach and duodenal surface cells defend themselves against acid loads. In the course of this work, they have become deeply involved in cell signaling and intracellular pathways when nutrients enter the duodenum. They have developed a technique for using confocal microscopy in vivo in this work.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27061311/,Competency based medical education in gastrointestinal motility,"Traditional apprenticeship-based medical education methods focusing on subjective evaluations and case-volume requirements do not reliably produce clinicians that provide high-quality care in unsupervised practice. Consequently, training approaches are shifting towards competency based medical education, which incorporates robust assessment methods and credible standards of physician proficiency. However, current gastroenterology and hepatology training in the US continues to utilize procedural volume and global impressions without standardized criteria as markers of competence. In particular, efforts to optimize competency based training in gastrointestinal (GI) motility are not underway, even though GI motility disorders account for nearly half of outpatient gastroenterology visits. These deficiencies compromise the quality of patient care. Thus, there is a great need and opportunity to shift our focus in GI motility training towards a competency based approach. First, we need to clarify the variable rates of learning for individual diagnostic tests. We must develop integrated systems that standardize training and monitor physician competency for GI motility diagnostics. Finally, as a profession and society, we must create certification processes to credential competent physicians. These advances are critical to optimizing the quality of GI motility diagnostics in practice.",competency based medical education; gastrointestinal motility; health care quality.,R Yadlapati;R N Keswani;J E Pandolfino

The ""Society for Gastroenterology/GDR"" (GfG) has played a decisive role for the development of the Gastroenterology in the GDR. The society promoted medical education and constitutions of gastroenterological centers, fostered gastroenterological research and controlled the standards for the recognition of Gastroenterology as a state-accepted medical sub-discipline. An extensive program of scientific and educative events included two-annual meetings of scientific congresses, the ""Berka-Talks"", endoscopic workshops"" and featured special symposia such as for Hepatology, Pancreatology and gastro-intestinal Microbiology. Temporary working groups developed technical and professional legal advice. Although the GfG was a full member of the respective international organizations (OMGE, ASNEMGE, ESGE), it was almost impossible building up reliable international contacts in a mutual interest. Especially, contacts with colleagues representing the ""German Society of Digestion and Metabolic Diseases"" (DGVS) were impeded. With the political changes of 1989/1990, an association of the two German Societies for Gastroenterology seemed within reach. At a meeting in Halle (Saale) (March, 22nd, 1990), representatives of DGVS and GfG quickly agreed on modalities to merge the two societies. After the 45th meeting of the DGVS (October 3rd-6th, Essen) more than 600 GDR physicians could join the BRD society under accommodating conditions. The GfG had fulfilled its historical function as a ""bridge"" during the division of Germany with dignity and was suspended (November, 24nd,1990).",,R Nilius

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18548977/,Profound long-term effects of Nazism on patient care in gastroenterology,"It is common knowledge that in addition to the slaughter of millions of innocent civilians, Nazism caused direct damage to patient care by euthanasia of the handicapped, gruesome human experimentation, and ethnic cleansing of German medical schools. In gastroenterology, 53 prominent academicians living in Nazi-occupied Europe were persecuted by the Nazis. Prior studies analyzed this persecution as it related to gastroenterologists rather than to patient care. This study reports, however, that Nazi persecution led to a delay of more than one generation in the clinical application of major inventions by these gastroenterologists. These included flexible fiberoptic endoscopy, which was delayed from 1930 to 1957. Fiberoptic transmission was invented by Heinrich Lamm in 1930. Lamm was exiled from Nazi Germany in 1936, and this technique was clinically applied to endoscopy by Hirschowitz only in 1957. Another innovation was fecal occult blood testing for early colon cancer detection, which was devised by Ismar Boas before 1938. Boas committed suicide under Nazi oppression in 1938 and this modality was clinically applied by Greegor only in 1967. The acceptance of refugees from Nazi Germany or Austria into America or into the future State of Israel helped mitigate some of this damage. For example, eight eminent academic gastroenterologists who fled Nazi-occupied countries to then mandatory Palestine made major contributions to the development of academic gastroenterology in the soon-to-be established State of Israel.",,Mitchell S Cappell

The workshop aimed to provide a roadmap to help strategically guide research efforts during the next decade. Attendees were a diverse group of internationally recognized leaders in basic and clinical FBD research. This document summarizes the results of their deliberations, including the following general conclusions and recommendations. First, the high prevalence, economic burden, and impact on quality of life associated with FBDs necessitate an urgent need for improved understanding of FBDs. Second, preclinical discoveries are at a point that they can be realistically translated into novel diagnostic tests and treatments. Third, FBDs are broadly accepted as bidirectional disorders of the brain-gut axis, differentially affecting individuals throughout life. Research must integrate each component of the brain-gut axis and the influence of biological sex, early-life stressors, and genetic and epigenetic factors in individual patients. Fourth, research priorities to improve diagnostic and management paradigms include enhancement of the provider-patient relationship, longitudinal studies to identify risk and protective factors of FBDs, identification of biomarkers and endophenotypes in symptom severity and treatment response, and incorporation of emerging ""-omics"" discoveries. These paradigms can be applied by well-trained clinicians who are familiar with multimodal treatments. Fifth, essential components of a successful program will include the generation of a large, validated, broadly accessible database that is rigorously phenotyped; a parallel, linkable biorepository; dedicated resources to support peer-reviewed, hypothesis-driven research; access to dedicated bioinformatics expertise; and oversight by funding agencies to review priorities, progress, and potential synergies with relevant stakeholders.",Brain−Gut Axis; IBS; Intestinal Barrier Dysfunction; Microbiome.,Lin Chang;Carlo Di Lorenzo;Gianrico Farrugia;Frank A Hamilton;Gary M Mawe;Pankaj J Pasricha;John W Wiley

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17921934/,Endoscopic ultrasound teaching and learning,"Scientific publications in the field of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are raising up since the last twenty years. The value of EUS is directly proportional to the training, skill and experience of the endosonographer. In a recent series, the lowest annual number of examinations requested per year might be around 200-250 procedures. For achieving competence in all the fields of EUS, they recommended a minimum of 150 supervised cases, 75 of them being devoted to pancreaticobiliary diseases and 50 to fine needle aspiration (FNA). Many studies have yet confirmed the importance of the learning curve to improve the EUS accuracy. The accuracy of EUS staging of esophageal cancer was significantly improved over an 8-year period for T staging from 64% to 90% but not for N staging. Considering pancreaticobiliary diseases, some series reported the influence of training on accuracy of EUS-guided FNA of pancreatic masses. Even if the exact type and modalities for EUS training remained to be determined, the usefulness of a period of training in a center performing more than 200 procedures per year is confirmed. Improving cognitive EUS learning and technique required theoretical teaching and practical teaching with observation during live demonstration and echoendoscope hands-on in humans with an expert supervision or with different simulator models. In France, formal EUS training has been underway since 1991, with a two-year intensive program including 4 weeks of theoretical training and 20 one-day practical sessions per year. This program was updated in 2004 to include 3 weeks of theoretical course work including numerous video sessions and 1 week of practical sessions. Theoretical courses are given primarily by gastroenterologists and EUS experts, but also by pathologists, surgeons, anatomists and radiologists. Practical sessions include 4 days of live demonstrations and computed-based simulator (EUS mentor; Simbionix, Tel Hashomer, Israel) and one day with a swine model. Simulators, either computed-based simulator, Erlangen model, or live pigs are believed to shorten the learning phase of EUS. The live pig model was chosen for EUS credentialing because it appears to be similar in many respects to the human anatomy, especially for the pancreas, portal and mesenteric vessels, celiac axis, left kidney and spleen. In addition, for trainees, it often appears more exciting and stimulating than virtual model. However, EUS training on a swine model is recognized to be the more expansive way for EUS teaching. Between the pre and post-test, EUS fellows significantly improved their competence for the visualization of anatomical structures i.e. vena cava, mesenteric/splenic vein, celiac axis, pancreas and bile duct. At the end of the day-session, trainees were mostly able to recognize and follow these anatomical structures with both endoscopes. Interventional EUS learning was also assessed. A significant decrease in procedural duration and a significant increase in FNA precision were demonstrated for the puncture of a hilar liver lymph node.",,M Barthet

Mean scores increased < 10% after the lecture series. Residents who had taken a 2-mo elective in GI (n = 15) valued it highly as an educational experience, but scored no differently on the examination than those who had not. There was no significant difference in pretest scores based on year of residency. On a similar examination in cardiology, the score of 17 residents who had taken a 2-mo cardiology rotation was identical to that of 12 who had not.

In clinical research as well as practice, financial conflicts of interest must be disclosed and managed to insure that patients have sufficient information to make a decision regarding participation in a study and to insure their safety. Medical education of care-givers in training carries the obligation and liability to oversee the care of the IBD patient and insure that safe and optimal care. This review addresses medicolegal issues that can arise in the care of the patient with IBD. Clinicians who provide optimal care for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) must employ appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic options and also adhere to standards of care and ethical principles. Ethical and medicolegal issues can arise from the failure to adhere to the standards of medical care, clinical research and education.

Given the complex nature of the diagnosis of IBD and its management there is consequently a large economic burden seen across all health care systems. Quality indicators (QI) have been created to assess the different façades of disease management including structure, process and outcome components. Their development serves to provide a means to target and measure quality of care (QoC). Multiple different QI sets have been published in IBD, but all serve the same purpose of trying to achieve a standard of care that can be attained on a national and international level, since there is still a major variation in clinical practice. There have been many recent innovative developments that aim to improve QoC in IBD including telemedicine, home biomarker assessment and rapid access clinics. These are some of the novel advancements that have been shown to have great potential at improving QoC, while offloading some of the burden that IBD can have vis-a-vis emergency room visits and hospital admissions. The aim of the current review is to summarize and discuss available QI sets and recent developments in IBD care including telemedicine, and to give insight into how the utilization of these tools could benefit the QoC of IBD patients.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18402638/,The journey to establish purinergic signalling in the gut,"Although the concept of purinergic signalling arose from experiments designed to find the identity of the non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) inhibitory neurotransmitter in the gut, it has taken many years for the more general importance of the various roles of ATP as a physiological messenger in the gut to be recognized. Firstly, vasoactive intestitial polypeptide (VIP) and later nitric oxide (NO) were considered the NANC transmitter and it was only later, after the concept of cotransmission was established, that ATP, NO and VIP were recognized as cotransmitters in NANC nerves, although the proportions vary in different gut regions. Recently, many purinoceptor subtypes have been identified on myenteric, submucosal motor, sensory and interneurons involved in synaptic neurotransmission and neuromodulation and reflex activity of several kinds, including ascending excitatory and descending inhibitory reflex pathways. Nucleotide receptors have been shown to be expressed on enteric glial cells and interstitial cells of Cajal. Purinergic mechanosensory transduction, involving release of ATP from mucosal epithelial cells during distension to stimulate subepithelial nerve endings of intrinsic and extrinsic sensory nerves to modulate peristalsis and initiate nociception respectively, is attracting current attention. Exciting new areas of interest about purinergic signalling in the gut include: involvement of purines in development, ageing and regeneration, including the role of stem cells; studies of the involvement of nucleotides in the activity of the gut of invertebrates and lower vertebrates; and the pathophysiology of enteric purinergic signalling in diseases including irritable bowel syndrome, postoperative ileus, oesophageal reflux, constipation, diarrhoea, diabetes, Chaga's and Hirschprung's disease.",,G Burnstock

Although major strides have been made in understanding the pathogenesis of this rare disorder, including a probable autoimmune mediated destruction of inhibitory neurons in response to an unknown insult in genetically susceptible individuals, a definite trigger has not been identified. The diagnosis of achalasia is suggested by clinical features and confirmed by further diagnostic tests, such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), manometry or barium swallow. These studies are not only used to exclude pseudoachalasia, but also might help to categorize the disease by severity or clinical subtype. Recent advances in diagnostic methods, including high resolution manometry (HRM), might allow prediction of treatment responses. The primary treatments for achieving long-term symptom relief are surgery and endoscopic methods. Although limited high-quality data exist, it appears that laparoscopic Heller myotomy with partial fundoplication is superior to endoscopic methods in achieving long-term relief of symptoms in the majority of patients. However, the current clinical approach to achalasia will depend not only on patients' characteristics and clinical subtypes of the disease, but also on local expertise and patient preferences.",,Alexander J Eckardt;Volker F Eckardt
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15690485/,Treatment challenges and investigational opportunities in autoimmune hepatitis,"New drugs and advances in molecular biology afford opportunities to upgrade the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis. The aims of this study were to define treatment problems, identify possible solutions, and stimulate investigations to improve patient care. A clinical subcommittee of the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group reviewed current management difficulties and proposed corrective actions. The assessment of new front-line and salvage therapies for adults and children were given top priority. Cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil were endorsed as drugs worthy of rigorous study in severe disease, and budesonide was endorsed for study as front-line therapy in mild disease. Diagnostic criteria and treatment regimens for children required codification, and pharmacokinetic studies were encouraged to develop optimal dosing schedules based on therapeutic ranges. Collaborative efforts were proposed to help understand racial, geographical, and genetic factors affecting outcome and to establish definitions and therapies for variant syndromes and graft dysfunction after transplantation. The development of experimental animal models was deemed essential for the study of site-specific molecular interventions, and gene therapy was endorsed as a means of bolstering reparative processes. In conclusion, evolving pharmacological and technical advances promise to improve the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis, and investigations of these advances are timely, feasible, and necessary.",,Albert J Czaja;Francesco B Bianchi;Herschel A Carpenter;Edward L Krawitt;Ansgar W Lohse;Michael P Manns;Ian G McFarlane;Giorgina Mieli-Vergani;Gotaro Toda;Diego Vergani;John Vierling;Mikio Zeniya

The American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society (ANMS) and the European Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility (ESNM) jointly evaluated the components of NGM training in North America and Europe. Eleven training domains were identified within NGM, consisting of functional gastrointestinal disorders, visceral hypersensitivity and pain pathways, motor disorders within anatomic areas (esophagus, stomach, small bowel and colon, anorectum), mucosal disorders (gastro-esophageal reflux disease, other mucosal disorders), consequences of systemic disease, consequences of therapy (surgery, endoscopic intervention, medications, other therapy), and transition of pediatric patients into adult practice. A 3-tiered training curriculum covering these domains is proposed here and endorsed by all NGM societies. Tier 1 NGM knowledge and training is expected of all gastroenterology trainees and practicing gastroenterologists. Tier 2 knowledge and training is appropriate for trainees who anticipate NGM disorder management and NGM function test interpretation being an important part of their careers, which may require competency assessment and credentialing of test interpretation skills. Tier 3 knowledge and training is undertaken by trainees interested in a dedicated NGM career and may be restricted to specific domains within the broad NGM field. The joint ANMS and ESNM task force anticipates that the NGM curriculum will streamline NGM training in North America and Europe and will lead to better identification of centers of excellence where Tier 2 and Tier 3 training can be accomplished.",curriculum; motility testing; neurogastroenterology.,C P Gyawali;E Savarino;A Lazarescu;S Bor;A Patel;R Dickman;A Pressman;A M Drewes;J Rosen;V Drug;M Saps;L Novais;M Vazquez-Roque;D Pohl;M A L van Tilburg;A Smout;S Yoon;J Pandolfino;G Farrugia;G Barbara;S Roman

European Board of Gastroenterology,"Gastroenterological training differs so greatly from country to country in Europe it is impossible to believe that training is equally good in each one. This in turn, provides a barrier to the free migration of doctors with the European Community. These differences also create confusion for migrating patients, and call into question the validity of the European Commission directives, which pronounce all qualifications obtained in European Community countries to be equally acceptable within the community. The European Commission does not have the power to unify medical training, but the medical profession itself acting in concert as a European body could harmonise the differences to ensure acceptable standards of training across the community. The Union of European Medical Specialists (UEMS) is the representative body of national medical specialists bodies, which reports to the European Commission. The European Board of Gastroenterology, a working party of the Gastroenterology Section of the UEMS has agreed acceptable and fair standards of training for gastroenterologists, and has developed a system for external assessment of training centres and faculty.

Together with the technical expert Georg Wolf he developed in 1932 the semiflexible gastroscope, which for about 25 years was the standard gastroscope worldwide before the onset of the fiberscopic era. With his previously constructed rigid gastroscope he became the founder of routine gastroscopy. His Lehrbuch und Atlas der Gastroskopie made him the leading endoscopic authority. He founded the ambulant gastroenterological-endoscopic practice. He was the first to describe and differentiate gastritis. In 1941 he founded the American Gastroscopic Club, he was its first president and the first editor of the journal of this society. For about 40 years he practiced gastroscopy every day with his wife Gabriele. Last but not least, Schindler was a leading authority, which attracted a steadily increasing number of pupils. Schindler was born and grew up in Berlin. He made most of his innovations in Munich between 1920 and 1934. An arrest by the Nazis of two months duration in 1934 drove him away from Germany. In the next decade he made Chicago the Mekka of gastroscopy. In 1943 he moved to California, From 1958 through to 1950 he worked in Belo Horizonte, Brasil. He spent his last years again in Munich.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21304497/,GI training: where are we headed?,"Gastroenterology (GI) fellowship training slots are not expected to increase over the next 10 years despite a 9% estimated US population growth. There is also no expected increase in the number of hours worked per gastroenterologist; instead, this number will probably decrease slightly, as GI will have continued growth in the percentage of women and of men in dual career families. The current trend of ""sub-specialization"" within GI is likely to continue, although this will not be formally recognized by further extension of the length of training or by additional board requirements. Current sub-specialties include hepatology, inflammatory bowel disease, motility, small bowel imaging, and interventional endoscopy. Most ""sub-specialty"" GI training will be incorporated within the 3-year fellowship, with the probable exception of interventional endoscopy, which will likely take an additional training year. End points for training and criteria for credentialing in the future will focus more on quality measures in both procedural and cognitive aspects of GI. Hopefully, this move to ""competency evaluation with quality measures"" will eliminate undertrained endoscopists such as the non-gastroenterologist performing occasional colonoscopy or the gastroenterologist performing occasional ERCP. Post-graduate GI training is also undergoing transformation, partly due to a decrease in industry support of graduate medical education, which has previously been heavily relied upon. The expected wider use of web-based training by the technology-comfortable younger generation of physicians may partly fill this gap. Despite the challenges facing GI training at both the fellowship and post-graduate level, GI is expected to remain a popular specialty choice. It is likely that sub-specialization within GI will continue to grow in both academic and private practices due in part to an increasing focus on quality patient outcomes.",,Grace H Elta

Thus, there is a need for more efficient, evidence-based and evaluated continuing medical education (CME) programs. But CME in one's own speciality interest is not enough. CME has to be extended into a broader context of continuing professional development (CPD) including personal, social and political aspects of medical practice. New methods have to concentrate on adult learning principles, individual needs and self-directed learning and have to promote performance-based assessment, outcome evaluation, communication skills, patient education and the use of computers and telecommunication technologies. All principles have to begin before entering medical school and then be continued and supported through a new medical curriculum from undergraduate to postgraduate training according to the 'lifelong learning' principle. All honorable gastroenterology, hepatology and endoscopy societies throughout the world should further define professionalism and develop leadership and management programs for their members. Nevertheless, every doctor always has a personal responsibility for lifelong learning.",,S Meryn

Therefore, it is only natural that some of the trainees in hepatology, familiar with invasive procedures just like their counterparts in gastroenterology, may become subspecialized in invasive aspects of this specialty, traditionally performed by interventional endoscopists, radiologists and surgeons. Moreover, there will be major developments in the management of the complications of liver disease. Endoscopic screening with esophageal capsule endoscopy and, to a lesser extent, ultrathin upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may replace conventional endoscopy. In addition to standard treatments for esophageal varices, removable esophageal stents with expansile pressure may be utilized in refractory variceal hemorrhage. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts may be performed by hepatologists. Advances in argon plasma coagulation, cryotherapy and photodynamic therapy may result in novel treatment options for portal hypertensive gastropathy.

Minilaparoscopy will allow a macroscopic assessment of the liver surface as well as the ability to target specific regions for histopathology, and treatment including radiofrequency ablation of liver cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) may provide the potential to directly measure portal vein pressure and this may have a future role in titration and optimization of pharmacological therapy of portal hypertension.

Such pancreatic tests fell into disuse because of advances in radiology of the biliary tree in the 1920s. Once extracts of secretin and cholecystokinin-pancreozymin became available from Sweden in the 1930s, it became possible for the biochemist Franklin Hollander and the surgeon David Dreiling to develop pancreatic secretion tests into practical procedures for the diagnosis of benign and malignant diseases of the pancreas and biliary tree, and produce physiological studies of the mechanisms of ion transport. With more purified hormones, it became possible to measure maximum (alkaline) bicarbonate output of the pancreas analogous to the maximal acid response of the stomach to an augmented histamine test, and to determine whether patients with duodenal ulcer had decreased neutralization of gastric acid in the duodenum. Clinical studies were also directed to the pathophysiology of acute relapsing and chronic pancreatitis and carcinoma.

H (2)-breath tests are clinically established for the diagnosis of carbohydrate intolerance resulting from malabsorption (H (2)-breath tests with lactose, fructose, saccharose, sorbitol), of bacterial overgrowth (glucose H (2)-breath test) and for measurement of orcoceal transit time (lactulose H (2)-breath test). The (13)C-urea breath test is regarded as the ""gold standard"" procedure for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection. Moreover, (13)C-breath tests for measurement of gastric emptying can be considered as clinically established, meanwhile. (13)C-breath tests for the evaluation of pancreatic exocrine function or liver function can also be used clinically; however, they currently offer no substantial advantage over other diagnostic procedures. A major disadvantage of all breath tests is that they lack standardization although modifications of the test meal or solution, of the test performance and of the evaluation of data may markedly influence the results. Thus, this article presents the recommendations of the German Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility and of the German Society of Digestive and Metabolic Diseases for clinically relevant H (2)- and (13)C-breath tests.

Thus, research into causes and disease modifiers in PHT in these conditions is vitally important. PHT is rarely directly or indirectly measured in the assessment of children with chronic liver disease. A straightforward, reproducible definition of PHT could be invaluable for consistently identifying patients with PHT and for grouping these patients according to their risk of complications from their disease. We propose the term Clinically Evident Portal Hypertension (CEPH) to denote clinical findings that demonstrate evidence of elevated portal pressure. When CEPH criteria are met, PHT is highly likely to be present, although it is likely that PHT exists for variable periods of time before meeting CEPH criteria. Use of this research definition of CEPH will allow for consistent identification of these patients by clinicians in nearly any clinical setting and serve as a clinical milepost that may dictate future prognosis in pediatric patients with cirrhosis.",,Lee M Bass;Benjamin L Shneider;Lisa Henn;Nathan P Goodrich;John C Magee;Childhood Liver Disease Research Network (ChiLDReN)

The multiparametric and large detailed information necessitates novel analyses to explore the insight of diseases and to aid the diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and deep learning (DL) provide various models of supervised, or unsupervised algorithms, and sophisticated neural networks to generate predictive models more precisely than conventional ones. The data, application tasks, and algorithms are three key components in AI. Various data formats are available in daily clinical practice of hepatology, including radiological imaging, EHR, liver pathology, data from wearable devices, and multi-omics measurements. The images of abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging can be used to predict liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and differentiation of benign tumors from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using EHR, the AI algorithms help predict the diagnosis and outcomes of liver cirrhosis, HCC, NAFLD, portal hypertension, varices, liver transplantation, and acute liver failure. AI helps to predict severity and patterns of fibrosis, steatosis, activity of NAFLD, and survival of HCC by using pathological data. Despite of these high potentials of AI application, data preparation, collection, quality, labeling, and sampling biases of data are major concerns. The selection, evaluation, and validation of algorithms, as well as real-world application of these AI models, are also challenging.

Twenty-four centers with pediatric IF teams in eight countries completed the survey, representing a total number of 316 children on HPN. The median number of children on parenteral nutrition (PN) at home per team was 5.5 (range 1-50). Teams consisted of the following members: pediatric gastroenterologist and a pediatric surgeon in all teams, dietician (95.8%), nurse (91.7%), social worker (79.2%), pharmacist (70.8%), oral therapist (62.5%), psychologist (58.3%), and physiotherapist (45.8%).

Definition of competence, however, has been an elusive goal. Most organizations, including professional societies and hospital privileging committees, have relied on estimated numbers of procedures performed or subjective assessment by a proctor as a surrogate marker of competence. Increasingly, objective assessment of performance is recognized as important in determining competence. Recent data have shown that learning curves for trainees are substantially more gradual than generally thought, and that the number of procedures required to achieve basic technical proficiency is much higher. Emerging data demonstrate that there is substantial variation in outcomes of endoscopy in clinical practice, related in part to the prior training, subspecialty background, ongoing case volume, and the individual endoscopist. Outcome variations correlate with both technical success and complications. Strategies for assessing competence in trainees and those in practice include numbers of procedures performed, subjective or objective assessment by a proctor, and self-assessment by the trainee. In the future, it is hoped that computers will be increasingly used to document outcomes of endoscopy in training and clinical practice as a part of routine report generation.",,M L Freeman

This paper considers a number of specific matters likely to arise in the context of a clinical negligence/malpractice claim resulting from the use of non-anesthesiologist-administered propofol, in particular the role and standard of care expected of gastroenterologist and/or anesthetic provider, the relevance of FDA labeling, the implementation and use of protocols, the importance of patient selection and informed consent.",,Andrew E Axon

Pediatric Chronic Hepatitis B and C: 30 Years of ESPGHAN Clinical Research and Recommendations,"The expression of hepatitis B and C virus infections in children differs from that in adults and requires specific paediatric expertise. The European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) has been a pioneer in this field, having stressed the need for straightforward recommendations since the mid-1980s. Following much observation, surveillance, and research, a panel of ESPGHAN experts was able to develop such recommendations on hepatitis B infection in children in 2009, which was then followed in June 2013 by proper guidelines. In the field of Chronic Hepatitis C, in 2011 ESPGHAN experts published also the Guidance for Clinical Trials for Children and Adolescents, and approved in 2012 the NASPGHAN guidelines for treatment. The ESPGHAN Society is to be commended for its pioneering work in furthering our understanding of chronic hepatitis B and C disease presentations in infants, children, and adolescents.",,Etienne M Sokal;Pilar Nannini
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7873266/,[Training in diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP],"Training in diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedures is difficult and tedious. Currently, there is no consensus on how to plan and put it into practice. We believe that training in these procedures must be included in the training program of the gastroenterology resident, since the efficiency of these methods (both diagnostic and therapeutic) in biliopancreatic disease including their clinical, social and economic benefits are beyond doubt. Training in diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography should be planned for about 3 months including at least 100 procedures under supervision of an experienced endoscopist; on the other hand, training in the therapeutic aspects needs, in our opinion, a longer period, perhaps and additional 3 to 6 month period, although this goal is difficult to achieve in the 4-year program of a gastroenterology resident. A frequent performance of the techniques is required to acquire competence. In this paper, we emphasize the ideal conditions that, must be fulfilled to achieve an appropriate training in the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.",,V Moreira;C Martín-de-Argila;E Meroño;A García Plaza

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29596188/,Chapter 7. The Contributions of the ESPGHAN Committees on Nutrition to Paediatric Nutrition,"The first Committee on Nutrition (CoN) was founded in 1974. Two years later nutrition (N) was added to the society's name, which then became ESPGAN. The Committee systematised compositional and quality criteria for breast milk substitutes and food for special medical purposes, the first of many examples on how recommendations and comments published by the Committees on Nutrition (CsoN) were adopted by the European Economic Community, later the European Union and also influenced the World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Codex standards. A second CoN focusing on preterm infants was established in 1979 and its recommendations on nutrition of these infants were widely implemented. The third and standing CoN, established 1986, started to organise high-quality symposia at the annual meetings appreciating the need to enhance the expertise in nutritional research. From 1991 the CoN has organised Summer Schools in paediatric nutrition for young colleagues further emphasising its educational interest and more recently an annual, more specialised Nutrition Masterclass. Successively the interest of the CoN has expanded to other areas, such as highlighting dilemmas and uncertainties in the field of nutrition including the design, choice of outcomes and statistical analysis of trials in infant nutrition. The work of the CsoN have had great impact on paediatric nutrition and the committee will continue its important role by writing commentaries and systematic reviews and revising guidelines when required to inform and stimulate discussion among colleagues as well as stimulate training in paediatric nutrition by organising workshops and scientific meetings, training courses, and other approaches, and by interaction with other expert groups.",,Olle Hernell;Peter Aggett;Mary Fewtrell;Berthold Koletzko;Jean Rey

Published guidelines and clinical trials concerning issues of training, complications and quality control in ERCP have been reviewed. The Working Group recommended that a trainee reach a minimum threshold of 200 cases before the assessment of competency. The target for achievement of competency was set at an 85 percent successful cannulation rate for native papilla. To perform advanced ERCP, endoscopists should have undergone dedicated training either in a recognised training centre or in conjunction with and under the guidance of a more experienced colleague, until technical competency is achieved. Precut should only be performed by endoscopists with experience and expertise in performing Levels II and III ERCP, who have been formally proctored. An audit of ERCP should examine parameters such as appropriate indication, success rates of selective cannulation, technical success rate of commonly performed procedures and procedure-related complications.

This funding can be accomplished while adapting to and embracing managed care. Academic gastroenterologists need to work closely with managed care in developing novel means of training fellows and focusing research on outcomes (both clinical and economic). At the same time, academic gastroenterologists have to compete in the marketplace for patient care revenue as a funding source. This competition requires a concerted effort to improve efficiency in academic practice and is likely to result in less time devoted exclusively to research and teaching. Increased clinical practice can also result in enhanced clinical research opportunities, however, as well as an ability to expand teaching in an ambulatory setting.

Because prior studies have focused mainly on pediatric providers, understanding these issues from the perspective of the adult hepatologist may provide novel insights and identify key barriers to care in this population. We conducted a national survey of adult transplant hepatologists to assess factors that may affect the transition of recipients from pediatric care to adult care. More than half of transplant hepatologists from all United Network for Organ Sharing regions (236/408 or 57.8%) completed the survey, and they reported that only 46.1% of patients arrived at their first adult clinic with both adequate knowledge of their condition and a parent/guardian. Moreover, 32.4% reported having no transition strategy, and only 15.5% reported having a formal transition program. The respondents reported that the greatest barriers to optimal care were patients' poor adherence and their limited knowledge and management of their condition. Those who reported participating in a formal transition program were less likely to report an inability of patients to discuss the impact of their condition on their overall daily life, fitness, and sexuality as a barrier to transition (odds ratio = 0.40, 95% confidence interval = 0.16-1.00).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9439948/,Managed care. Evolution and distinguishing features,"Managed care as a system of health care delivery has grown tremendously in popularity in the United States during the past decade in response to demands by employers and government for cost containment, enhanced access, and improved quality. Managed care took root in the 1800s as prepaid health services provided by employers for immigrants coming to the United States to work. The forerunner of modern managed care, prepaid group practice, later was dwarfed by the unbridled development of FFS medicine under indemnity insurance in the post-World War II period and stunted by early reactions of organized medicine. The early health care reform years of the 1960s spawned HMO legislation in the 1970s, which prompted ever-escalating growth in HMO enrollment. Market-driven health reform has prompted the evolution of health care delivery to the modern-day version of managed care. In this system, health care is provided by a limited number of contracted providers at reduced rates of reimbursement. Patients are channeled to these contracted providers, and clinical decision making of these providers is influenced by the MCO through utilization management and quality assurance. Financial risk is shifted from payers and insurance companies to providers to influence further clinical decision making. All of these characteristics of managed care pressure providers toward higher levels of integration and foster greater reliance on management information systems. Gaining a perspective from the history of managed care, understanding managed care's distinguishing features, and dealing effectively with the pressures of these unique characteristics are important in successfully caring for patients, managing the risk structure, and succeeding professionally in this current environment for health care delivery.",,J T Frakes

It seems that a similar policy is followed by the other countries of Latin America. The aim of the undergraduate teaching is the training of a general physician. The teaching of subspecialities is just a part of internal medicine. The education and training program should take this interrelationship into account, to prepare a general physician concerned with the biopsychosocial unity of the patient. The students must be trained for the diagnosis and management of the commonest disorders of the alimentary tract. As a speciality, gastroenterology education starts after graduation, in a 2-year program of medical residency, following a 1-year training in internal medicine. In Brazil there are courses for graduates following the medical residency program, to prepare for master's and doctor's degrees.",,C Fraga

Obscure GI bleeding (OGIB) is defined as loss of blood with no source identified after upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. Whether an obscure site of bleeding is clinically evident or silent, it constitutes a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for the clinician. Gastroenterology and radiology provide the essential diagnostic tools used to evaluate suspected OGIB, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Small bowel series and conventional enteroclysis have a limited role in OGIB. Computed tomographic (CT) enterography and CT enteroclysis are noninvasive techniques with promising results in evaluation of small bowel disease and silent OGIB. CT angiography is a useful triaging tool for diagnosing or excluding active GI hemorrhage, localizing the site of bleeding, and guiding subsequent treatment. Tagged red blood cell scanning is the most sensitive technique for detection of active GI bleeding and allows imaging over a prolonged period, making it useful for detecting intermittent bleeding. Capsule endoscopy has emerged as an important tool for investigating OGIB, but it may soon have competition from double-balloon enteroscopy, a diagnostic technique that can also facilitate therapy.",,Bruno M Graça;Paulo A Freire;Jorge B Brito;José M Ilharco;Vitor M Carvalheiro;Filipe Caseiro-Alves

This study aimed to detect alkaline reflux in gastro-oesophageal reflux patients using dual probe pH monitoring. Thirty patients with histologically diagnosed CLO, 15 age and sex matched patients with oesophagitis (grade 1-3), and 15 healthy volunteers were studied by dual probe, 18 hour pH monitoring and analysis of the bile acid content of oesophageal refluxate. Total acid exposure and acid exposure in the upright and supine postures were greater in CLO subjects than in oesophagitis patients and controls. Furthermore, the number of reflux episodes lasting more than five minutes and the duration of the longest reflux episode were significantly greater in the CLO subjects than the oesophagitis and control subjects. Nine subjects with CLO and oesophagitis, however, were not identified as refluxers, although six had a bile acid concentration in their oesophageal aspirate higher than the 95th centile value of the controls. There was no correlation between the oesophageal pH and the bile acid contents of refluxate.

However, when viewed globally, these goals are not incongruent but are inexorably linked. Prevention of disease or avoidance of further morbidity and mortality by curing H. pylori infection is obviously an improved clinical outcome, but it also concurrently avoids further utilization of healthcare resources and is ""cost-effective,"" resulting in improved economic outcome as well. The more clinically effective an H. pylori treatment is, the more economically effective it is as well. When comparing regimens, the cost-effectiveness is determined by efficacy of the regimen, not its cost. Put more simply, ""The most expensive therapy is the one that doesn't work!"" Therefore, the goals of the therapy are simple: avoid further morbidity, mortality, and prevent disease while minimizing further utilization of healthcare resources, thus saving money. The most clinically effective therapy is also the most cost-effective therapy.

The aim of our study was to examine our practice of open access endoscopy by evaluating the appropriateness of referrals for colonoscopy and to determine whether there were differences depending on the specialty of the referring clinician. The indication for colonoscopy was assessed in 499 consecutive outpatients referred for colonoscopy at University Hospital, Kuala Lumpur over a 12-month period. The American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines were used to determine the appropriateness of referrals. 80.6% of colonoscopies requested by the gastroenterologist were performed for accepted indications compared to 50.6% of referrals by the primary care physician (p<0.001) and 67.0% of referrals by the surgeon (p=0.006). The rate of colonoscopies generally not indicated was 2.1% for the gastroenterologist, 25.0% for the internist (p=0.002) and 7.5% for the surgeon (p=0.04). The rate of indications not listed in the ASGE guidelines was significantly lower for requests made by gastroenterologists (17.3%) than those requested by primary care physicians (44.2%; p<0.001). Patients who have had prior consultation with the gastroenterologist were significantly more likely to undergo colonoscopy for appropriate indications than among patients who were referred through an open access system. The rate of inappropriate indications for colonoscopy was also significantly lower when the gastroenterologist made the referral.

In memory of Prof. Géza Hetényi],"In the course of memorial lecture the author commemorates Professor Géza Hetényi. His synthetizering role is stressed, analysing the professor's views on the clinical and theoretical medicine, on the medical practice and teaching in the medicine. Author performs it from the points of view of practising pathologist who considered the clinical pathology as the most important. After these introductory thoughts the role of pathologist is outlined in the gastroenterological diagnostics. Before the introduction of modern fiberoptic endoscopy, the pathologist met with some forms of the gastroenterological diseases at most during the processing work of surgically removed specimens or even more in the autopsy room, but in the latter cases only their end stage could be demonstrated. The introduction of so-called blind exfoliative cytology by the gastric lavage was a great leap forward. Advanced gastric carcinoma were detected mostly by this method but some early gastric cancer could be also discovered occasionally. The more and more wide-spread use of modern fiberpotic endoscopy was of decisive importance because by this way the aimed forceps biopsy could be performed completed with a new form of gastric cytology, with abrasive smears. The specificity and sensitivity of the latter method achieves or surpasses the 90%. Nowadays, not only the stomach carcinomas but their possible precancerous conditions and changes as chronic gastritis can be diagnosed on morphological basis. The history of different gastritis classifications is also surveyed emphasised author's own pathogenetic conceptions which can be included well in our now accepted modern Sydney-classification.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,A Bajtai

This was assessed by means of a postal survey to all consultant general surgeons in Wales in 1996-1997. The areas covered were: awareness of the guidelines of The Royal College of Surgeons of England and the impact of such guidelines on their practice, attendance at hernia courses, operative technique, materials used for repair and skin suture, proportion of day case hernias, length of inpatient stay, thromboembolic (TE) prophylaxis and postoperative advice to patients with regard to light work, heavy work and sport. In all, 79 replies were received (85%). Almost all the surgeons had read the guidelines; this changed the practice of 20% of respondents but did not in 32%. A further 48% did not answer the question. In contrast with our 1993 survey results, in Wales there is now a uniform surgical management of adult inguinal hernias: the most common operation is the Liechtenstein, with monofilament non-absorbable suture to secure the mesh, followed by the Shouldice repair. The Bassini and inguinal darn operations are becoming much less common and none now uses braided or absorbable sutures for the repair.

The Working Team of Glaxo-Wellcome Research, UK","An international working team of 13 investigators met on two occasions to develop guidelines for standardizing the procedures used to test gastrointestinal muscle tone and sensory thresholds using a barostat. General recommendations were: (1) Use a thin-walled plastic bag that is infinitely compliant until its capacity is reached. Maximum diameter of the bag should be much greater than the maximum diameter of the viscus. (2) The pump should be able to inflate the bag at up to 40 ml/sec. (3) Pressure should be monitored inside the bag, not in the pump or inflation line. (4) Subjects should be positioned so that the bag is close to the uppermost surface of the body. (5) For rectal tests, bowel cleansing should be limited to a tap water enema to minimize rectal irritation. Oral colonic lavage is recommended for studies of the proximal colon, and magnesium citrate enemas for the descending colon and sigmoid. (6) If sedation is required for colonic probe placement, allow at least one hour for drug washout and clearance of insufflated air. Ten to 20 min of adaptation before testing is adequate if no air or drugs were used. (7) The volumes reported must be corrected for the compressibility of gas and the compliance of the pump, which is greater for bellows pumps than for piston pumps. (8) Subjects should be tested in the fasted state. For evaluation of muscle tone: (9) The volume of the bag should be monitored for at least 15 min. For evaluation of sensory thresholds; (10) It is recommended that phasic distensions be > or = 60 sec long and that they be separated by > or = 60 sec. (11) Sensory thresholds should be reported as bag pressure rather than (or in addition to) bag volume because pressure is less vulnerable to measurement error. (12) Tests for sensory threshold should minimize psychological influences on perception by making the amount of each distension unpredictable to the subject. (13) Pain or other sensations should be reported on a graduated scale; not ""yes-no."" The working team recommends verbal descriptor scales, containing approximately seven steps, or visual analog scales in which subjects place a mark on a straight line marked ""none"" on one end and ""maximum"" on the other end.

The first, extending from the division's creation in 1957 to the retirement in 1988 of its first division chief, Fenton Schaffner, was characterized by brilliant clinical and pathophysiologic insights derived from the unique collaboration of Schaffner, a master clinician, with Hans Popper, a world renowned pathologist widely acknowledged as the father of the modern discipline of hepatology. The second, extending from the appointment in 1988 of Paul D. Berk as Schaffner's successor to the present day, has witnessed enormous growth in the clinical and scientific activities of the division, together with the emergence of a world-class liver transplant program at Mount Sinai. During this recent period, an extensive program of formal clinical research was established; the basic research program then expanded into the areas of hepatic transport, molecular virology, and the cellular and molecular pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis; and both the clinical and research productivity of the division increased dramatically. A major undertaking, now in its second year, has been the creation of the Center for the Study of Primary Biliary Cirrhosis; Mount Sinai has contributed important advances toward the understanding of this disease. Funding for the Center, from the Artzt Family Foundation Trust, supports a series of interrelated basic studies on the immunology and pathobiology of the disease, as well as creation of a unique clinical database, a serum and tissue bank, and a program of clinical studies. This integration of basic and clinical research in pursuit of new methods of diagnosis and treatment serves as a model for the division's continued leadership role.",,P D Berk;A D Min;S L Friedman

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1730977/,"Comparison of left anterior oblique, anterior and geometric mean methods for determining gastric emptying times","The accurate determination of gastric emptying time requires correction or compensation for tissue attenuation. The gold standard for tissue attenuation correction for gastric emptying is the geometric mean of the gastric counts from the anterior and posterior views. For reasons of efficiency, many community hospitals acquire only the anterior projection. This study addressed the hypothesis that, using the left anterior oblique view alone, one can minimize the effect of variation in attenuation as the meal moves from the fundus to the stomach to the more anterior antrum to a degree equal to that of the geometric mean technique. We studied 42 consecutive patients using a standardized 300-g meal labeled with 650 muCi of 99mTc-sulfur colloid. The patients were imaged in the anterior (ANT), posterior (POST) and left anterior oblique (LAO) views every 15 min for 90 min. Linear regressions were obtained using the ANT, LAO and GM data. Cross-correlation of the T1/2 for 35 cases showed an R value for the GM versus LAO of 0.95 and GM versus ANT of 0.84. The p value greater than 0.49, for the paired two-tailed t-test of the LAO and GM methods. The p value for the ANT and GM methods is 0.0058 indicating a significant difference between these methods. The cross-correlation, F-test p and t-test p values support the hypothesis that there is no significant difference between the geometric mean and left anterior oblique gastric emptying times. It is therefore reasonable to substitute the left anterior oblique for routine GET when using a solid meal in patients with normal gastric anatomy, albeit altered physiology.",,P V Ford;R L Kennedy;J M Vogel

The aim of this study was to validate a microtip pressure transducer for intraluminal GB pressure measurements. In vitro precision and accuracy was within 0.2 mmHg, (SD) and 0.6 +/- 0.1 mmHg (mean +/- SD), respectively. Pressure rise rate was 24.8 +/- 5.5 mmHg s-1. Zero drift was in the range 0.3 +/- 0.4 to 0.8 +/- 0.9 mmHg (mean +/- SD). GB pressure was investigated in 16 patients with acute cholecystitis treated with percutaneous ultrasonically guided cholecystostomy. Basal intraluminal GB pressure was 8.9 mmHg (2.1-12.2 mmHg; n = 9, open cystic duct) and 1.8 and 5.8 mmHg (n = 2, closed cystic duct). There was no significant difference between two different measurements in the same patients (n = 5). The pressure was significantly influenced by respiration (n = 8) and the pressure seems to be higher in the sitting position than in the supine position (n = 5). Cystic duct opening pressure was 10.4, 11.2 and 16.8 mmHg (n = 3). Pressure-volume responses showed that the GB up to a certain volume could accommodate increases in intraluminal volume with only slight changes in intraluminal pressure (n = 4). Except for the zero drift, this piece of equipment seemed to fulfil the requirements of being able to measure pressure in the GB. In vivo measurements showed a good clinical reproducibility of the method, and also that respiration and patient posture influenced the pressure measurements. Further, a GB pressure-volume relationship was demonstrated, and the possibility of a cystic duct opening pressure was described.",,L Borly;L Højgaard;S Grønvall;J G Stage
