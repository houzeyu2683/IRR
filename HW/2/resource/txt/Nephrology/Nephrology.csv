https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31451330/,"Artificial Intelligence in Nephrology: Core Concepts, Clinical Applications, and Perspectives","Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important role in many fields of medicine, assisting physicians in most steps of patient management. In nephrology, artificial intelligence can already be used to improve clinical care, hemodialysis prescriptions, and follow-up of transplant recipients. However, many nephrologists are still unfamiliar with the basic principles of medical artificial intelligence. This review seeks to provide an overview of medical artificial intelligence relevant to the practicing nephrologist, in all fields of nephrology. We define the core concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning and cover the basics of the functioning of neural networks and deep learning. We also discuss the most recent clinical applications of artificial intelligence in nephrology and medicine; as an example, we describe how artificial intelligence can predict the occurrence of progressive immunoglobulin A nephropathy. Finally, we consider the future of artificial intelligence in clinical nephrology and its impact on medical practice, and conclude with a discussion of the ethical issues that the use of artificial intelligence raises in terms of clinical decision making, physician-patient relationship, patient privacy, and data collection.",Deep learning; IgA nephropathy (IgAN); algorithms; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network (ANN); augmented intelligence; big data; convolutional neural networks (CNN); hemodialysis; kidney disease; machine learning; medical artificial intelligence (MAI); neural network; review; transplantation.,Olivier Niel;Paul Bastard

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33131644/,The Nephrology Clinician Educator: Pathway and Future,"In the medical profession, teaching has always been a routine expectation for practicing physicians. While this remains true today, in recent years, we have seen the emergence of a well-defined career pathway for those practicing physicians who want to focus on education: the clinician educator. This is a physician who is highly active in the practice of teaching, science of learning, service as a role model for young physicians, and leading educational programs. In nephrology, one can have a fruitful and fulfilling career as a lifelong clinician educator. As career interest in our specialty wanes, the clinician educator is the professional well suited to reverse this trend. In this article, we will further define the clinician educator and map out a pathway of skills needed to thrive in this rewarding career. We also provide recommendations to both educators and leaders to ensure the clinician educator pathway continues to grow.",Clinician educator; Medical education; Nephrology education; Professional development.,John K Roberts;Anna M Burgner;Timothy Yau

As recounted in this recollection of those events, the rudiments of what would become nephrology emerged in the time between the 2 World Wars from basic studies of normal kidney function and flourished after the integration of their methodologies into clinical medicine thereafter. Although shaped by studies of kidney function in the 1960s, it was the subsequent advent of dialysis that fueled the growth of nephrology well into the 21st century. Although to some extent this growth was a product of technical developments (micropuncture, dialysis, biopsy, etc), it was the paradigm shifts they engendered that brought about the revolutionary changes that stimulated the growth of nephrology from its formative years in the 1960s. Notable among those was the classification of chronic kidney disease on the basis of kidney function, calculated from serum creatinine level as estimated glomerular filtration rate, that has expanded nephrology's interaction with and integration into other disciplines and begat the recent outpouring of epidemiologic and interventional studies, thereby establishing it as a leading discipline dedicated to improving outcomes for individuals with kidney disease worldwide.",Nephrology; chronic kidney disease (CKD); clinical trials; dialysis; glomerular filtration rate (GFR); guidelines; renal replacement therapy (RRT); review.,Garabed Eknoyan

The potential downside to nanonephrology is the renal clearance of nanoparticles, the use of which is ever-increasing both for nanomedicinal purposes and in nanofoods. The positive impact of nanotechnology in Nephrology is centred on the development of renal nanodiagnostics for basic renal function studies, the early diagnosis of acute kidney injury, reliable and simple follow-up of chronic kidney disease and the improvement of magnetic resonance imaging. Renal drug nanotherapies comprise an important and dual-faceted area: The protection of drugs and nephrotoxic agents (e.g. antibiotics, antiretrovirals, contrast media, etc.) on the one hand, and the development of new kidney disease medications on the other. Renal 'nanotheranostics' is a promising but little-studied area. The impact of nanostructured supports on renal tissue regeneration is also discussed.

Today, most academic centers face significant financial challenges, thus the division chief must develop a variety of skills to accomplish his or her goals. Interactions and relationships with the leadership of the academic center, including the hospital executives, can facilitate or impede progress on proposed projects; therefore, aligning the goals of the division with the goals of leadership is an imperative. Engagement, assessment, mentorship, and sponsorship of the faculty members are essential tasks because any project will require faculty input and buy in. A division chief's networks outside of the home academic medical center are critical for successful recruitment of new faculty, establishment of beneficial relationships with research funding agencies, and development of cooperative programs with industries such as dialysis corporations. Effective communication skills and honest self-assessment of strengths and weaknesses with the wisdom to seek expertise when needed are keys to success.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30982672/,Big science and big data in nephrology,"There have been tremendous advances during the last decade in methods for large-scale, high-throughput data generation and in novel computational approaches to analyze these datasets. These advances have had a profound impact on biomedical research and clinical medicine. The field of genomics is rapidly developing toward single-cell analysis, and major advances in proteomics and metabolomics have been made in recent years. The developments on wearables and electronic health records are poised to change clinical trial design. This rise of 'big data' holds the promise to transform not only research progress, but also clinical decision making towards precision medicine. To have a true impact, it requires integrative and multi-disciplinary approaches that blend experimental, clinical and computational expertise across multiple institutions. Cancer research has been at the forefront of the progress in such large-scale initiatives, so-called 'big science,' with an emphasis on precision medicine, and various other areas are quickly catching up.

Other health issues have relegated the treatment of kidney diseases to a low priority status, and the cost of treating the more common and widespread communicable diseases, financial mismanagement and corruption in many countries has sounded the death knell for expensive therapies such as dialysis. The communicable diseases that have devastated the health systems around Africa are tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. Until recently, very little information was available on the impact of HIV on acute and chronic dialysis admissions. Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) in most of Africa are seldom treated because of great distances to travel, lack of expertise, poverty and poor sustainable funding for health matters.

Attracting high-quality candidates into nephrology training programs is the first step in this process. The training program directors (TPDs) in nephrology launched an initiative several years ago to standardize the application and recruitment process for applicants to their programs. This has recently culminated in the completion of a formal matching process using the Medical Specialties Matching Program (MSMP). This review will outline the history of this process and present the results of the recent matching process in nephrology for applicants who applied to training programs with a start date of July 1, 2009. The authors report that 89% of participating programs and 95% of applicant positions were filled. On the basis of a survey of nephrology TPDs, the match process was successful, with almost all respondents planning on participating in the match with a start date of July 1, 2010.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20418002/,Nephrology training in the 21st century: toward outcomes-based education,"Twentieth century postgraduate nephrology training evolved from an apprenticeship model to a defined period in formal fellowship. Subsequently, curriculum content taught by an engaged faculty, including broad clinical exposure, literature review, and investigative experience, established the benchmark of quality education. Self-directed study by the trainee was emphasized, and competence to practice nephrology was presumed in part on the basis of adequate exposure to a program's curriculum. At the close of the century, multiple accreditation bodies of medical education questioned the validity of this educational process in medical training. As a result, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education instituted 6 general competencies as the foundation of an outcomes-based education philosophy. Although some disciplines have developed an evidence base for educational techniques directed at outcomes, nephrology has few publications in this arena and these principally address curriculum structure. Interventional nephrology is a recent exception. In this area of training, publications have appeared linking educational process with learner outcome. Opportunities are abundant to implement and study new educational techniques, including simulation and e-learning. To keep pace with contemporary medical education philosophy, the nephrology education community is challenged to apply evidence-based education techniques to the training of 21st century nephrologists.",,Mark G Parker

I predict that the Academic branch of Nephrology will continue to excel in three domains: Creative Research,Teaching (Training) and Innovative Clinical Care. I forsee dramatic changes in Nephrology practice in the short term (10 years) and I discuss which areas will have a most dramatic impact. Many developments will likely curtail the growth of CKD and decrease the burden of ESRD on society. The greatest challenge will be to ensure that what can be done to alleviate suffering and premature death from kidney disease will be done, in a cost-effective manner, and that all patients with kidney disease have reasonable and timely access to care for their illnesses.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21688247/,Nephrology around Europe: organization models and management strategies: Spain,"The main aim of this report is to present a picture of the current organization of nephrology in Spain. The Spanish health system offers almost universal coverage, a wide variety of services and a high-quality network of hospitals and primary care centers. Spain has a specialized health care training system that is highly developed, highly regulated, with the capacity to provide high-quality training in 54 different specialties. Nephrology is basically a hospital-based specialty. There are no private dialysis patients in Spain. Hemodialysis centers are 40% public, 15% private and 45% run by companies. The National Health System covers 95% of the population, and there is no cost to patients for treatment of renal disease (dialysis and transplant). We observed a clear decrease of nephrology in residents' election rankings, with position 29 out of 47 specialties in 2007. Some of the reasons for this are the complexity of the subject, no clear information at the university, reduction of professional posts and a very good public service with minimal private practice. In Spain, a model of organization for transplantation was adopted based on a decentralized transplant coordinating network. For cadaveric donors, it compares favorably with rates in other Western countries. Living donor transplantation is very low in Spain--just 10% of total renal transplantation activity. New programs due to financial constraints need to include reduced dialysis costs, greater cost-effectiveness of prescriptions, better handling of ethical issues related to the need for using a clinical score of chronic kidney disease patients to make decisions about conservative or renal replacement therapy and an action plan for improvement of organ donation and transplantation. Recovery of skills (acute kidney injury, biopsies, vascular access, etc.), research and advances in autonomous activities (imaging, surgical and medical vascular training, etc.) are some of the future educational paths needed in nephrology. Adequate decisions in the context of economic restrictions need to be discussed for the sustainability of nephrological care.",,Angel L M de Francisco;Celestino Piñera
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15876837/,Challenges in interventional nephrology,"Lately, there has been a progressive decrease in the interest of nephrology as a medical sub-specialty reflected primarily in the decreasing number of renal fellows. Rising costs in establishing and running dialysis clinics and the lost of nephrologic procedures previously performed by nephrologists are among the many reasons for this disillusionment with the specialty. The care of chronic kidney patients frequently involve many diagnostic and interventional radiological procedures such as: diagnostic renal ultrasonography, ultrasound-guided kidney biopsies, placement of tunneled hemodialysis catheters or peritoneal catheters, sonographic and radiological investigation of vascular access dysfunction, etc. Most of these procedures are nowadays performed by radiologists, vascular surgeons and surgeons in general. This fragmentation does not optimize medical care and it is inconvenient to the patient. This has led many nephrologists to introduce a new paradigm in kidney patients management, often referred as interventional nephrology (IN). This new breed of nephrologists have acquired diagnostic and interventional skills for procedures usually done by others with an added clinical perspective. To train nephrologists in these procedures and avoid the fragmented care of renal patients, the American Society for Diagnostic and Interventional Nephrology was established in 2000 and the International Society of Nephrology in 2004 introduced a new committee to address the issues of IN. It is hoped that concerted efforts will help to rescue these activities for the nephrologists and improve quality of patient care.",,Miguel C Riella

Academic medical centers that value excellent clinicians may have the best chance to recruit and retain these faculty members. When our institution hoped to launch the Miller Coulson Academy of Clinical Excellence to measure and reward master clinicians, a critical first step was to use rigorous methods to develop a definition of clinical excellence. Published papers have illustrated that this general definition of clinical excellence is applicable to fields of psychiatry, cardiology, and pediatrics. In this manuscript, we apply the definition of clinical excellence to nephrology. Using the same framework, we reviewed the literature to find clinical cases and exemplary nephrologists that highlight the specific domains. This collection of reports in nephrology illustrates that the definition of clinical excellence set forth by the Miller Coulson Academy is highly applicable to physicians caring for individuals with kidney disease.

While some of Mesopotamian contributions to knowledge (writing, mathematics, astronomy) have been recognized, those made to medicine are just beginning to be studied and appreciated. The medicine of the time developed in a theocratic society where local gods controlled all aspects of life and their healers were learned scribes who established the priestly medicine of old. For their use of prayers and incantations as a component of therapy Mesopotamian medicine has been belittled and relegated to magic. In fact, the Mesopotamian healers established the basic medical skills of observation, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment and, over time, systematically produced an expanding corpus of medical knowledge that had not existed theretofore. The kidney as an organ, the components of the urogenital tract, some signs and symptoms of renal diseases, and the art of urinalysis were first conceptualized, studied, and codified in Mesopotamia. In doing so, the Mesopotamians set the foundations of rational medicine that would follow after the introduction of the phonetic alphabet and the Socratic method of questioning and debate to stimulate critical analysis.",,Garabed Eknoyan

A bibliographic research relating to this period was undertaken with the aim of investigating the number and the quality of the studies on kidneys published by Italian scientists. A total of 176 publications of Italian scientists dealing with kidney diseases or physiology was retrieved, 10.8% of which was published on foreign journals. The analysis of the topics treated shows that they were up to date and comparable with the contemporary studies across Europe. Moreover, the issues raised remained of interest throughout the following decades up to our day. Top Italian researchers were fairly cited, especially if they published on international journals. While at the time the state of other organs was mainly assessed by examining physical signs and symptoms, kidney studies required laboratory facilities. This limitation meant that kidney scholars usually belonged to well established medical faculties. From these schools, a few figures stood out among the others for the importance of their studies, both physiological and clinical in nature. The same figures also gave birth to the major Italian schools of internal medicine from which, half a century later, originated the Italian Society of Nephrology.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26913750/,Why the history of nephrology?,"Nephrology is a relatively new discipline that emerged at a time when the writing of the history of medicine was changing drastically. While the merits of medical history were valued since antiquity, it was only in the 18th century that the actual historiography of medicine began. It was nurtured, matured and appreciated enough that by the late 19th and early 20th centuries, medical history was incorporated into the medical curriculum and presented at national meetings. Unfortunately, the merits of medical history and its inclusion in medical education have come under increasing scrutiny over the past few decades. Ironically, the erosion began at about the same time that scholarly work on the history of medicine was flourishing whilst that of scientific discovery and innovation in medicine was accelerating. The demands of rigorous research into the history of medicine gradually led to the emergence of medical history as an independent discipline within academic departments of history. Simultaneously, the exponential growth of new information generated by medical research led to an overflow of medical knowledge in which the inclusion of medical history was contested and dismissed. That is just about the time that nephrology emerged in the 1960s. Whereas initially the quest for origins led renal journals to publish historical articles, the more recent quest to increase impact factors has led to the exclusion of historical articles from consideration for publication.

The absence of ionizing radiations and nephrotoxicity, rapidity of execution, excellent repeatability, the possibility to perform the test at the patient's bed and the low cost represent important advantages of this technique. Paired with real-time sonography and colour-power-Doppler contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) reduces the diagnostic gap with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) and represents a major step in the evolution of clinical ultrasound. Although there are several situations in which contrast-enhanced CT and MR are indicated (i.e. evaluation of cystic or ischemic lesions, traumatisms and ablative therapies of the native and transplanted kidney), the use of CT contrast media presents a high risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (i.e. in elderly people, subjects with comorbidities and those with renal dysfunction), while gadolinium-based RM contrast agents are contraindicated for the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (i.e. in patients with severe renal dysfunction). In these situations, CEUS may be a viable alternative, however, as any technique associated with the infusion of pharmacological substances, the potential advantages and risks of CEUS should be critically evaluated. In this regard, the European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB) has published the guidelines for the use of CEUS for the kidney imaging and the International Contrast Ultrasound Society (ICUS) has been recently founded.

Due to the huge population and enormous territory, nephrologists are facing a great mission and momentous challenges. Most nephrologists reside in the coastal region, which has a higher education background than most of the rest of the country. Among them, Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhong and Nangjing are the major centers for training graduate students to conduct basic and clinical research. Renal biopsy is widely performed in China. IgA nephropathy is the leading cause among the primary causes of glomerulonephritis that are diagnosed by renal biopsy, while lupus nephritis is the most prominent among the causes of second glomerulopathy. Though diabetic nephropathy now constitutes only about 10% of the cause of secondary glomerulopathy, the rapid rise of diabetes mellitus predicts a future prominent role of this disease in managing progressive renal failure in China. Both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are widely used in China, with approximately a 40 to 50% survival rate in three years. About two thirds of the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients received erythropoietin; however, the hematocrit levels of most cases are less ideal. A variety of sources, mainly from the government, in several big cities provide financial support for ESRD dialysis, which has already become a heavy burden to public health. About 5000 patients receive renal transplantation every year in which the organs are mainly from brain dead cadavers. Renal disease registration has been established since 1999. Controlling the high incidence of diabetes and early treatment, studying the genetic and environmental mechanisms possibly related to the high incidence of IgA nephropathy in rural areas, and establishing a nationwide network to apply guidelines for dialysis and transplantation in a fashion relevant to real situations in China are major challenges to the Chinese nephrologists.",,Shanyan Lin

This study compared the effects of 3 types of nephrology care: multidisciplinary care (MDC), nephrology care, and non-nephrology care. We studied their effects on the risks of requiring dialysis and the differences between these methods had on long-term medical resource utilization and costs.We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of (eGFR) ≤45 mL/min/1.73 m from 2005 to 2007. Patients were divided into MDC, non-MDC, and non-nephrology referral groups. Between-group differences with regard to the risk of requiring dialysis and annual medical utilization and costs were evaluated using a 5-year follow-up period.In total, 661 patients were included. After other covariates and the competing risk of death were taken into account, we observed a significant (56%) reduction in the incidence of dialysis in both the MDC and non-MDC groups relative to the non-nephrology referral group. Costs were markedly lower in the MDC group relative to the other groups (average savings: US$ 830 per year; 95% confidence interval: 367-1295; P < .001).For patients without nephrology referrals, MDC can substantially reduce their risk of developing end-stage renal disease and lower their medical costs. We therefore strongly advocate that all patients with an eGFR of ≤45 mL/min/1.73 m should be referred to a nephrologist and receive MDC.",,Jui-Hsin Chen;Yi-Wen Chiu;Shang-Jyh Hwang;Jer-Chia Tsai;Hon-Yi Shi;Ming-Yen Lin

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21422617/,Current indication of plasma exchanges in nephrology: a systematic review,"Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been firstly performed with centrifugation devices used in blood banking procedures. Nowadays, TPE is increasingly performed in intensive care units using hemodiafiltration generators that ensure better efficiency and simplicity. However, prescription for the different medical pathologies depends on weak evidence-based recommendations, and is often guided by the clinician's own experience. In this review, we briefly recall the rationale of TPE prescription before discussing the evidence level of common indications of TPE in nephrology. Currently, strong evidence-based data for the benefit of TPE is clearly demonstrated in renal diseases such as hemolytic uremic syndrome, anti-glomerular basement membrane vasculitis, and recurrent glomerulonephritis after kidney transplantation and management of humoral renal allograft rejection in high-risk recipients. However, the other indications of TPE, such as renal vasculitis associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, mixed cryoglobulinemia, periarteritis nodosa, and acute renal failure in myeloma are still controversial. Finally, TPE have been found to be clearly inefficient in lupus nephritis, except for patients with associated thrombotic mic-roangiopathy or catastrophic antiphospholipid antibodies syndrome. More randomized clinical trials are required to precisely place TPE in the management of renal diseases. Meanwhile, the decision to use this burdensome and costly therapy should be individualized according to its proven benefits and potential complications.",,Sidy M Seck;Dussol Bertrand;Diouf Boucar

We concur with the KDIGO definitions and classification of kidney disease and welcome the addition of albuminuria categories at all levels of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the terminology of G categories rather than stages to describe level of GFR, the division of former stage 3 into new G categories 3a and 3b, and the addition of the underlying diagnosis. We agree with the use of the heat map to illustrate the relative contributions of low GFR and albuminuria to cardiovascular and renal risk, though we thought that the highest risk category was too broad, including as it does people at disparate levels of risk. We add an albuminuria category A4 for nephrotic-range proteinuria and D and T categories for patients on dialysis or with a functioning renal transplant. We recommend target blood pressure of 140/90mm Hg regardless of diabetes or proteinuria, and against the combination of angiotensin receptor blockers with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We recommend against routine protein restriction. We concur on individualization of hemoglobin A1c targets. We do not agree with routine restriction of sodium intake to <2g/d, instead suggesting reduction of sodium intake in those with high intake (>3.3g/d). We suggest screening for anemia only when GFR is <30mL/min/1.73m(2). We recognize the absence of evidence on appropriate phosphate targets and methods of achieving them and do not agree with suggestions in this area. In drug dosing, we agree with the recommendation of using absolute clearance (ie, milliliters per minute), calculated from the patient's estimated GFR (which is normalized to 1.73m(2)) and the patient's actual anthropomorphic body surface area. We agree with referral to a nephrologist when GFR is <30mL/min/1.73m(2) (and for many other scenarios), but suggest urine albumin-creatinine ratio > 60mg/mmol or proteinuria with protein excretion > 1g/d as the referral threshold for proteinuria.",Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO); albuminuria; chronic kidney disease (CKD) staging; clinical practice guideline; kidney disease progression.,Ayub Akbari;Catherine M Clase;Phil Acott;Marisa Battistella;Aminu Bello;Patrick Feltmate;Allan Grill;Meena Karsanji;Paul Komenda;Francois Madore;Braden J Manns;Sara Mahdavi;Reem A Mustafa;Andrew Smyth;E Sohani Welcher

The first portion of the KDIGO guideline attempts to harmonize earlier consensus definitions and staging criteria for AKI. While the expert panel thought that the KDIGO definition and staging criteria are appropriate for defining the epidemiology of AKI and in the design of clinical trials, the panel concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support their widespread application to clinical care in the United States. The panel generally concurred with the remainder of the KDIGO guidelines that are focused on the prevention and pharmacologic and dialytic management of AKI, although noting the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations and the continued absence of effective therapies beyond hemodynamic optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins for the prevention and treatment of AKI.",,Paul M Palevsky;Kathleen D Liu;Patrick D Brophy;Lakhmir S Chawla;Chirag R Parikh;Charuhas V Thakar;Ashita J Tolwani;Sushrut S Waikar;Steven D Weisbord

Is it possible to give a prescription and decide regardless of compassion?"".

Cystic kidneys may enlarge up to 20 times the weight of a normal kidney due to the growth of renal cysts, and patients with ADPKD have an increased risk of morbidity, premature mortality, and other life-time complications including renal and hepatic cyst and urinary tract infection, intracranial aneurysm, diverticulosis, and kidney pain which impair quality of life. Despite some therapeutic advances and the growing number of clinical trials in ADPKD, the outcomes that are relevant to patients and clinicians, such as symptoms and quality of life, are infrequently and inconsistently reported. This potentially limits the contribution of trials to inform evidence-based decision-making.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12012313/,"Training, certification, and reimbursement for nephrology procedures","The field of interventional nephrology is rapidly developing as an important new area of nephrology practice that holds great promise for improved patient care, outcomes, and cost control. This development is contingent on nephrologists acquiring the necessary knowledge and skills through suitable training and experience, and obtaining hospital privileges to perform these interventions. As more training programs are created, and credentialing criteria are established and accepted, it will become more practical for nephrologists to become interventionists. Reimbursement for interventional procedures can be complicated and confusing, with special problems applicable to a nephrology practice involved in the overall care of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. It is essential to become familiar with applicable procedure codes, global periods, and code modifiers to correctly describe these procedures and receive correct reimbursement. Nephrologists work together with vascular access surgeons and interventional radiologists to provide care for dialysis patients. The role of each specialist in the management of vascular access depends on his or her level of interest, knowledge, and technical skill. These roles may vary considerably from one practice to another. There is potential for this area to become highly contentious, especially if one specialist feels threatened by the activities of another. Optimal patient care will be achieved only if all involved physicians take a serious intellectual interest in vascular access, develop superior clinical skills, and maintain cooperative, collegial, relationships.",,Theodore F Saad

From 2002 to 2009, all internal medicine subspecialties except geriatric medicine increased the number of available fellowship positions. However, only two subspecialties attracted fewer United States medical graduates (USMGs) in 2009 than in 2002: geriatric medicine and nephrology. This drop occurred at a time when demand for nephrologists is increasing and when the specialty is having a harder time benefiting from the substantial contribution of international medical graduates (IMGs). Today's USMGs possess fundamentally different career and personal goals from their teachers and mentors. Medical students report receiving minimal exposure to nephrology in clinical rotations, and they perceive that the specialty is too complex, uninteresting, and lacks professional opportunity. Meanwhile, the demographics of kidney disease in the United States, as well as recent national health policy developments, indicate a growing need for nephrologists.

The web-based tools discuss hemodialysis adequacy, principles of urea transport, hemodialysis access examination and access complications. These tools are open access and structured around the science of cognitive learning using animation, interactivity, self-assessment and immediate feedback features. They have been viewed by a wide audience of nephrologists, dialysis nurses as well as medicine house-staff and have received strong validation in a post-test survey. The online tools have supported a 'flipped classroom' instructive model and our blended curriculum has been successfully used for nephrology fellow training at our institution.

To this aim, the ERA-EDTA has created a European Accreditation Council for CME in nephrology, dialysis and renal transplantation (ERA-EDTA EACCME). It acts not on-ly by accrediting European meetings providing great educational value, but aims to expand the commitment of the ERA-EDTA in educational activities everywhere in Europe.

He introduced in 1962 the first artificial kidney for the treatment of acute renal failure. In 1963, the first acute peritoneal dialysis was done. Renal biopsy started in 1967 with general pathologists. A special laboratory of renal pathology was set up in 1975 with Pr H. Ben Maïz. Epidemiology of glomerular diseases, when histologically proven, was published [8]. A comprehensive program of chronic hemodialysis was started in 1968 and was developed markedly since 1975 with Pr A. El Matri. An intermittent peritoneal dialysis programme was started in 1982 and CAPD in 1983 by Pr T. Ben Abdallah. The Tunisian renal failure patient association was created in 1982 and the Tunisian society of nephrology in November 1983. A national registry for ESRD treatment is available since 1986. Since this time, the number of patients initiating renal replacement therapy (RRT) for ESRD has increased dramatically due to the extension of acceptance criteria for RRT and the increase of the elderly population. The incidence was 13 pmp in 1986 and 133 pmp in 2008. The prevalence was 48.5 pmp in 1986 and 734 pmp in 2008. From 1971 up to 1986, locally dialysed patients have been transplanted abroad, especially in France. On 4 June 1986, the local transplantation program was started at Charles Nicolle Hospital in Tunis. A national center of organ transplantation was created on 12 June 1995. At the end of 2008, there were 106 nephrologists, 26 residents in nephrology and 253 doctors with a training in hemodialysis during 1 year. In university hospitals, the number of nephrology departments is five, with one unit in an army hospital and two units for pediatric nephrology. Five hospitals perform renal transplantation (Tunis: 2 - Sfax: 1 - Sousse: 1 - Monastir: 1). There are 138 centers of hemodialysis: 39 public, 99 private. Seven thousand and eighty patients were treated by HD, 127 patients underwent renal transplantation. The vast majority of these transplants have been performed using living related donors (103/127). The cost of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is taken in charge by the Ministry of Health and the national security boards. Legislation on HD was promulgated by the Tunisian government, setting rigorous and detailed rules for the implementation of new dialysis centers, as well as for the functioning of already active units (4 August 1986 - 4 April 1998).

Processes related to drug pricing, reimbursement, and thereby availability, vary between countries, thus having implications on patient care. These processes are discussed, with specific focus on three drugs used in pediatric nephrology: agalsidase beta (for Fabry disease), eculizumab (for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome), and cysteamine bitartrate (for cystinosis).

Once seen as a temporary means of rescue from uremic coma, hemodialysis (HD) has allowed thousands of people with irreversible uremia to survive for many years, and evolving treatment modalities have led to a significant increase in efficacy and tolerability. At the same time, two other forms of renal replacement therapy (RRT) have been developed: peritoneal dialysis (PD) and renal transplantation. The number of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients requiring RRT has increased dramatically throughout the world for a number of reasons: the improved survival of patients affected by other diseases, a real increase in the incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) mainly due to the burden of 'metabolic syndrome', and the significant broadening of RRT acceptance criteria. This last factor means that RRT has become available to increasing numbers of elderly patients, diabetics and patients with other severe comorbidities, among whom the leading cause of death is cardiovascular disease (CVD).

He was an eminent clinician, teacher and scientist who belonged among the founders of renal medicine in Europe. He grew up in the scientific tradition of Prague and Vienna and he was trained by some outstanding personalities, particularly Paul Wood. He became famous due to his pathophysiological-clinical approach to hypertension, heart and kidney diseases. He was not only interested in renal and cardiac physiology but in the entire clinical nephrology. He was among the first clinicians who started to use creatinine clearance in routine practice. His early work was also performed in the field of acute glomerulonephritis and in interstitial nephritis. Later he was interested in water and electrolytes in heart failure and the pathogenesis of edema, and he published priority data on the hemodynamic pattern in emotional stress. Furthermore, it is for sure that he was one of the first cardionephrologists, too. As early as in 1950, he studied diurnal variation in renal perfusion and urinary output in heart failure and later the effect of the adrenergic blockade on the renal hemodynamics in heart failure. Up to his exile in 1968, he served as the head of the Institute for Cardiovascular Research based in Prague and later on, up to his retirement, as the head of the Department of Nephrology in Hannover. He was a founding member of the International Society of Nephrology and president of its 2nd congress held in Prague in 1963.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16970743/,Interventional nephrology in a federal hospital: economics of health care,"Interventional nephrology is now an accepted subspecialty of nephrology that is revolutionizing the standard of care for renal failure patients. Interventional nephrology deals with the placement of tunneled cuffed catheters (TCCs) and maintenance of permanent vascular accesses, thus assisting in timely care. Prior to 2000 most end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients from the Overton Brooks Veterans Affairs Medical Center (OBVAMC) were referred to an outlying hospital for TCC placement and endovascular procedures (EVPs) of permanent dialysis access. The referral process was cumbersome for the patients and expensive to the Medicine Service. OBVAMC started an interventional nephrology service in 2000. The current study reports the financial benefits of starting an interventional nephrology service at our institution. All procedures performed during the period from April 2000 to April 2004 were analyzed. The procedures were performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. The total payment (physician's and hospital fees) to the referral hospital for procedures prior to April 2000 was used to estimate the average savings to the Medicine Service over the last 4 years. A total of 129 TCCs and 43 EVPs were performed during this period. The estimated expense to OBVAMC would have been US dollars 603,978 for TCCs and US dollars 288,100 for EVPs based on charges prior to April 2000. The actual expense to the hospital, including facility fees and disposables, was US dollars 156,013. The net savings to OBVAMC over the last 4 years was US dollars 736,065.

While pediatric scientists before 1950 were concerned with fluid and electrolyte metabolism, regulation of intracellular and extracellular fluid, acid-base homeostasis, and parenteral fluid therapy, the defined field of nephrology developed after the Second World War around six major advances: ACTH and glucocorticoid therapy for nephrotic syndrome; renal biopsy to diagnose glomerular disease; the role of immunologic factors in glomerular injury; the use of dialysis as renal replacement therapy; renal transplantation as the optimal form of therapy in children with end stage renal failure; and recognition of renal disease in the etiology of 80% of cases of childhood hypertension. These discoveries led to focused research, the definition of specific training in nephrology, establishment of an American, European, and an International Society of Pediatric Nephrology, as well as an American Sub-Board of Pediatric Nephrology, and the inception of a journal, Pediatric Nephrology, now in its 15th year. Major research themes have included developmental nephrology, transplantation immunology, and concerns about growth in children with renal disease.

It was then that medical education was integrated into the universities that were coming into existence and when medicine made its transition from a menial trade to a regulated profession with a statutory basis of learning and graduation. It was also then that the necessities of understanding the fabric of the body was realized; for the first time in history, the study of anatomy and of human dissection were incorporated into the medical curriculum. This was a defining change whose subsequent expansion and evolution would bring about the study of function (physiology) and changes in disease (pathology). Few advances were made in the study of the kidney, which was considered part of the venous circulation, whose function was subservient to that of nutrition in eliminating excess fluid. Uroscopy flourished and reached unrealistic levels of dominance in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognostication of any and all diseases, especially in the hands of quacks and charlatans. Alchemy, a mysterious pseudo-science, blossomed into a discipline that nurtured experimentation and laid the rudimentary foundations of scientific study, chemistry, and pharmacology.

Low-income nations are challenged by a dearth and/or maldistribution of an essential workforce required for all chronic disease care including chronic kidney disease (CKD). Nephrology education and training in developed countries have grown at pace with the technological advancement in the practice of medicine in order to meet the standards required of kidney health professionals towards high-quality, patient-centered medical care. The standards designed by institutions and/or professional societies, such as Royal Colleges and Medical Councils in high-income nations with well-developed health systems and infrastructures, are often not easily translatable to issues critical to nephrology practice in low-income nations. Little or no guidance is provided on common nephrological issues of regional nature or pertaining to ethnic minorities and disadvantaged groups living in those countries. There is an emergent need for a training curriculum that meets the needs and peculiarities of the developing nations, and this needs to leverage on the existing and well-validated systems of training across the globe. We evaluated nephrology training programs across 25 upper-middle and high-income nations to identify best practices and opportunities for adoption in low-income nations. We reviewed training guidelines from major professional societies on content and process of training. There are similarities and differences in structure, content, and process of training programs across countries, and there are clearly adoptable concepts/frameworks for application in low-income nations. We provide recommendations and a strategic plan for the future focus of nephrology training in the developing world to align with current trends in technological advancement and development as well as the need for emphasis on prevention of CKD. The essential competencies (patient- and population--based) required of a nephrologist in a developing world setting are outlined with practical measures and an action plan for adoption.",,Julius Okel;Ike G Okpechi;Bilal Qarni;Timothy Olanrewaju;Mark J Courtney;Valerie Luyckx;Sarala Naicker;Aminu K Bello

As its articles can be authored and edited by anyone worldwide, the credibility of the medical content of Wikipedia has been openly questioned. Wikipedia medical articles have also been criticized as too advanced for the general public. This study assesses the comprehensiveness, reliability, and readability of nephrology articles on Wikipedia. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related problems, 10th Edition (ICD-10) diagnostic codes for nephrology (N00-N29.8) were used as a topic list to investigate the English Wikipedia database. Comprehensiveness was assessed by the proportion of ICD-10 codes that had corresponding articles. Reliability was measured by both the number of references per article and proportion of references from substantiated sources. Finally, readability was assessed using three validated indices (Flesch-Kincaid grade level, Automated readability index, and Flesch reading ease). Nephrology articles on Wikipedia were relatively comprehensive, with 70.5% of ICD-10 codes being represented. The articles were fairly reliable, with 7.1 ± 9.8 (mean ± SD) references per article, of which 59.7 ± 35.0% were substantiated references. Finally, all three readability indices determined that nephrology articles are written at a college level. Wikipedia is a comprehensive and fairly reliable medical resource for nephrology patients that is written at a college reading level. Accessibility of this information for the general public may be improved by hosting it at alternative Wikipedias targeted at a lower reading level, such as the Simple English Wikipedia.",,Garry R Thomas;Lawson Eng;Jacob F de Wolff;Samir C Grover

Among the skills we find the kidney biopsy that has a central role in diagnosis of renal parenchymal disease. One of the causes might be the belief that the kidney biopsy should be performed only in larger Centers which can rely on the presence of a renal pathologist and on nephrologists with a large experience.

It is of great concern that interest in obtaining nephrology fellowship training continues to decline in the United States, especially among US medical graduates, and the reasons for this are unclear. The exposure that students and residents have to nephrology is likely to play an important role in the career choices that they make and their ultimate satisfaction with this career choice is likely influenced by several factors, including job opportunities. Some of the findings presented here suggest that there may be a high percentage of nephrology fellows who are dissatisfied with their career choice. Failure to understand the factors that influence trainees to choose nephrology as a career and those that affect their satisfaction with this choice may impair the ability to graduate a sufficient number of nephrologists to meet projected demand. In this article, a number of variables related to the choice of nephrology as a career and satisfaction with a career in nephrology are discussed.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19695497/,The history of interventional nephrology,"Visionary nephrologists in the early 1960s invented the dialysis machine, constructed arteriovenous shunts and fistulas, and designed vascular and peritoneal catheters to provide their patients with long-term dialysis. As the number of dialysis patients grew, the construction and care of vascular access was abandoned by nephrologists to surgeons and radiologists. There was a decline in the number of fistulas and an increase in grafts in the United States. Vascular access was not the first priority for the nonnephrologists, and this set the stage for the emergence of diagnostic and interventional nephrologists. These self-taught nephrologists trained others, resulting in a critical mass of subspecialists who founded the Society of Diagnostic and Interventional Nephrology.

It was also not clear whether nephrology fellows in the US undergo formal training in PC medicine during fellowship. To gain a better understanding of the clinical training and experience of US adult nephrology fellows in PC medicine, we conducted a national survey in March 2012. An anonymous on-line survey was sent to US adult nephrology fellows via nephrology fellowship training program directors. Fellows were asked several PC medicine experience and training questions. A total of 105 US adult nephrology fellows responded to our survey (11% response rate). Majority of the respondents (94%) were from university-based fellowship programs. Over two-thirds (72%) of the fellows had no formal PC medicine rotation during their medical school. Half (53%) of the respondents had no formal PC elective experience during residency. Although nearly 90% of the fellows had a division or department of PC medicine at their institution, only 46.9% had formal didactic PC medicine experience. Over 80% of the respondent's program did not offer formal clinical training or rotation in PC medicine during fellowship. While 90% of the responding fellows felt most comfortable with either writing dialysis orders in the chronic outpatient unit, seeing an ICU consult or writing continuous dialysis orders in the ICU, only 35% of them felt most comfortable ""not offering"" dialysis to a patient in the ICU with multi-organ failure. Nearly one out of five fellows surveyed felt obligated to offer dialysis to every patient regardless of benefit.

Further, the growth of nephrology has been marked by the implementations of advanced forms of renal replacement therapy. Moreover, there is now the acute acknowledgement that the success of any modality of renal replacement therapy is contingent upon the integrity of its associated peritoneal or vascular access. Consequently, the concept of nephrologist as interventionalist has garnered broad appeal.

During World War II, it unexpectedly fell into the hands of John P. Peters of Yale University, who sought to understand water and electrolyte physiology and apply such knowledge to patient problems. Pupils and young associates of Peters would seed the early nephrology divisions and training programs in the United States; the flame photometer was essential to their work and that of their trainees, both Americans and international visitors. Hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion became the ""attribute"" disorders of nephrologists. Invention of a microflame photometer fostered the revival of micropuncture and transport studies. In the 1960s, the flame photometer was linked to Leonard Skeggs' sequential automated analysis system, leading to enormous numbers of routine measurements of electrolytes. The growing number of nephrologists, then based mostly at teaching hospitals, thus found plentiful instances of sodium and potassium abnormalities to address. The autoanalyzer also catalyzed use of the anion gap, another emblem of nephrology in its early decades. Not only ideas and theories, but also the usually invisible machinery, enable the growth of a knowledge base and formation of a scientific discipline or medical specialty. Of course, the flame photometer did not itself shape the agenda of nephrology, but it allowed the most influential group of progenitors and their progeny to explore normal function and bring a strongly physiologic imperative to their daily work with patients.",,Steven J Peitzman

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12097728/,The history of nephrology in the Talmudic corpus,"The kidneys, the bladder and nephrology in general were discussed in the Talmudic literature from their anatomical, pathological and philological aspects. The Sages' deliberations were based on the Biblical texts. The characteristic phraseology of the scriptures uses the kidneys as symbols of the human emotions, contrary to the heart, which is regarded as the location of wisdom. The kidney is considered to be the individual's seat of their deepest desires--perhaps because it is an ""internal"" organ, well hidden, surrounded by a capsule and by a layer of perinephric fat. The Talmudic corpus considers the kidneys to be the origin of secret counsels--""the kidneys advise"". An injury to the kidneys is used symbolically as an example of a cruel and serious injury. The sages were concerned with nephrological problems such as a diseased kidney of small size, fluid and pus in the kidney, injuries, perforations and more. Fascinating advice is given regarding micturition, its timing, characteristics and significance. The Halakhah is concerned with the kidneys during the examination of an animal after slaughter for the fitness for its ritual consumption. The paper presents various nephrological diseases from the Talmudic corpus. Among them are, for example, ""Tzemirtha""--urolithiasis; ""Hydrakon""--hydronephrosis; ""Suskhinta""--urinary retention; ""Tzinit""--podagra, gout, and ""Yerakon""--icterus.

The first studies were physiopathological and bore on acute uremia and the associated hydromineral disorders, nephrotic syndromes and the kidney of heart failure. The first treatments of acute renal failure including peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis were initiated. The concept of medical intensive care was elaborated and targeted on the hydromineral equilibrium. In parallel, the kidney diseases were classified, particularly the glomerular diseases including Berger's disease, owing to examination of the renal sections permitted by renal biopsy. There was a major turning point with the first renal transplantations and the first success to improve recipient tolerance to the graft. All these progress were reported and discussed at the first International Congress of Nephrology in Evian and Geneva in 1960 that was chaired by Jean Hamburger and where was decided the founding of the International Society of Nephrology.",,Gabriel Richet

Bias problems are dealt with using different approaches in observational studies and in clinical trials. The clinical trial is the standard for assessing the efficacy of treatments while the efficiency of treatments at community level is better captured by observational studies. Electronic medical records have now emerged as a precious, matchless data source for clinical audits. The value of an audit cannot be taken for granted and should be tested in the specific health care setting where it is applied. Electronic medical records and high quality clinical databases offer a great opportunity for performing observational studies and for reducing the cost of clinical trials. Research on audit and feedback functionality is a new, useful and stimulating research area which may be of great interest to nephrologists.",,Carmine Zoccali
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24655113/,The early modern kidney--nephrology in and about the nineteenth century (part 2),"Two basic science specialties that matured in the nineteenth century were instrumental in the transformation of medicine into a scientific discipline and in the process of establishing the evidentiary basis of the fundamental role of the kidney in maintaining homeostasis, whose continued exploration would lead to the emergence of nephrology in the following century. The first specialty was that of chemistry, which progressed from a descriptive to an analytical, organic, biological, and physical science that progressively eroded the animism of the ""vital"" forces of old and replaced it with the physicochemical forces and laws of chemical reactions that govern the ""matters of life"". The second specialty was that of cell biology, which established the cell as the structural and functional unit of living organisms, be they plant or animal. Refined microscopic technologies then helped to identify the structural components of the cell, amongst which the plasma membrane emerged as the most important in regulating the separation of the intracellular machinery from its external environment and thereby maintaining the internal milieu of cells. The interaction of these two specialties (chemistry, cell biology) clarified the functions of the cell in health and disease and extended it to the study of epithelial cell transport. This transforming turn of events established the role of the renal tubules in the vital function of the kidney of maintaining body homeostasis, a function well beyond that of the passive excretory filter of wastes and excess fluids it had been considered theretofore.",,Garabed Eknoyan

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16874730/,The history of nephrology in Poland,"Modern nephrology developed in Poland mostly from the internal medicine department chaired in Warsaw by the great internist prof. Witold Orłowski (1874-1966). Three of his pupils Tadeusz Orłowski, Jan Roguski and Jakub Penson independently established the foundations of clinical nephrology and renal replacement therapy in different parts of Poland. T. Orłowski and his team worked in Warsaw, where despite developing clinical nephrology and dialysis also performed the first successful renal transplantation in Poland in 1966. Thereafter in 1975 the Institute of Transplantology in Warsaw was established and for several years was the leading research and education center in nephrology and transplantology. J. Penson established a sound clinical nephrology program in Gdańsk, where later physiological and biochemical aspects of the kidney were studied by his successors -- A. Manitius and B. Rutkowski in collaboration with S. Angielski and his biochemical team. They were instrumental in establishing a successful program leading to the development of dialysis in Poland during the last twenty years. J. Roguski in Poznań continued the research on water-electrolyte balance, metabolic and endocrine disturbances in renal patients and immunology of glomerular diseases. The first HD treatment was performed in Poznań in 1958 by the group of J. Roguski and coworkers chaired by K. Baczyk. Subsequently, several strong academic centers were established throughout Poland. F. Kokot in Katowice being himself leader of the Polish nephrology for many years created a very active centre well known for its pioneer publications on water- electrolyte, acid- base and endocrine disorders in different stages of chronic kidney disease. F. Kokot and his successor A. Wiecek are also very active and well recognized on an international scale. In Wrocław a nephrological center was established by Z. Wiktor and later his coworkers Z. Szewczyk and recently M. Klinger. Other valuable academic nephrological centers were created in Kraków (Z. Hanicki, W. Sułowicz), Lublin (Z. Twardowski, A. Ksiazek), Łódź (Z. Orłowski, W. Chrzanowski), Bydgoszcz (A. Nartowicz, J. Manitius) and later Białystok (M. Myśliwiec), and others. Simultaneously strong academic units were formed in the military hospitals-Łódź (K. Trznadel, M. Luciak) and Warsaw (Z. Wańkowicz). The last center was for many years widely known for their studies concerning PD treatment. Pediatric nephrology developed in parallel with adult centers mainly in Warsaw (T. Wyszńska, M. Sieniawska, R. Grenda), Wrocław (Z. Morawska, D. Zwoliska) and Gdańsk (M. Uszycka-Karcz, A Zurowska).

Long work hours and a poor work/life balance may be partially responsible, and may also affect a fellowship's educational mission. We surveyed nephrology program directors using a web-based survey in order to define current clinical and educational practice patterns and identify areas for improvement. Our survey explored fellowship program demographics, fellows' workload, call structure, and education. Program directors were asked to estimate the average and maximum number of patients on each of their inpatient services, the number of patients seen by fellows in clinic, and to provide details regarding their overnight and weekend call. In addition, we asked about number of and composition of didactic conferences. Sixty-eight out of 148 program directors responded to the survey (46%). The average number of fellows per program was approximately seven. The busiest inpatient services had a mean of 21.5±5.9 patients on average and 33.8±10.7 at their maximum. The second busiest services had an average and maximum of 15.6±6.0 and 24.5±10.8 patients, respectively. Transplant-only services had fewer patients than other service compositions. A minority of services (14.5%) employed physician extenders. Fellows most commonly see patients during a single weekly continuity clinic, with a typical fellow-to-faculty ratio of 2:1. The majority of programs do not alter outpatient responsibilities during inpatient service time. Most programs (approximately 75%) divided overnight and weekend call responsibilities equally between first year and more senior fellows. Educational practices varied widely between programs.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19726117/,Five decades of Indian nephrology: a personal journey,"Impressive accomplishments have been made in Indian nephrology during the last 5 decades. The first renal biopsy performed in 1956 ushered in a new era of modern nephrology practice in India and led to the recognition of nephrology as a distinct specialty. The first hemodialysis facility was established in 1961; presently, there are 950 nephrologists, 850 hospitals equipped with dialysis facilities, and 170 institutions recognized for kidney transplantation, with approximately 3,500 transplantations performed every year. The majority of dialysis units are small minimal-care facilities with fewer than 5 dialysis stations, and more than 85% are in the private sector. Government hospitals provide free treatment to poor patients with chronic kidney disease; however, inadequate funding and lack of health insurance schemes pose serious hurdles in providing renal replacement therapy. In contrast, private/corporate hospitals located in big cities have large units with state-of-the-art dialysis and transplantation facilities, similar to advanced centers of the world, but are accessible to only upper-income groups. Of the estimated 175,000 new patients who develop end-stage renal disease annually, less than 10% are able to gain access to renal replacement therapy. Research in the field of renal diseases has evolved slowly and is focused primarily on tropical conditions. The availability of structured nephrology training programs coupled with excellent diagnostic and therapeutic facilities in some academic institutions and tertiary-care private/corporate hospitals have diminished the need for foreign travel by students, patients, and consultants to a considerable extent.

These options, however, are not always feasible, and hemodialysis (HD) is therefore an accepted alternative. In small children presenting with end-stage renal disease, HD presents several challenges and is often unavailable in lower- and middle-income countries. To assess these challenges and outcomes of maintenance HD in young children, we performed an audit of children below 20 kg with end-stage renal disease, receiving HD for ≥4 weeks, from 1 January 2008 to 31 July 2016 at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital. We identified 15 children weighing 6.8-18.5 kg (mean 12.9 kg ±3.5 SD) and aged 11.5-105 months (mean 52.2 months±4.2 SD) at HD initiation. Mean duration of HD was 11.8 months (range 1-61.5 months ± 16.9 SD). Seven children underwent successful transplantation, two patients died, and four currently still receive HD. Two patients, while on HD, relocated to other centers. An average of 2.6 (range 1-5) different vascular accesses was required per patient. Technical difficulties were the most common cause of central-line removal (81%), while catheter-associated bacteremia was 1.1/1000 catheter days. Frequent problems were intradialytic hypotension, growth stunting, and interdialytic hypertension. HD in lower- and middle-income countries is feasible in small children but presents with certain challenges.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23278189/,The early modern kidney--nephrology in and about the nineteenth century. Part 1,"The 19th century was a period of momentous scientific discoveries, technological achievements, and societal changes. A beneficiary of these revolutionary upheavals was medical empiricism that supplanted the rationalism of the past giving rise to early modern scientific medicine. Continued reliance on sensory data now magnified by technical advances generated new medical information that could be quantified with increasing precision, verified by repeated experimentation, and validated by statistical analysis. The institutionalization and integration of these methodologies into medical education were a defining step that assured their progress and perpetuation. Major advances were made in the nosography of diseases of the kidney, notably that of the diagnosis of progressive kidney disease from the presence of albuminuria by Richard Bright (1789-1858); and of renal structure and function, notably the demonstration of the continuity of the glomerular capsule with the tubular basement membrane by William Bowman (1816-1892), and the arguments for hemodynamic physical forces mediated glomerular filtration by Carl Ludwig (1816-1895) and for active tubular transport by Rudolf Heidenhain (1834-1897). Improvements in microscopy and tissue processing were instrumental in describing the cellular ultrastructure of the glomerulus and tubular segments, but their integrated function remained to be elucidated.

This level of participation reflects the response of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to criticism that the program as outlined in the proposed rule was overly burdensome, prescriptive, and too risky. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service made significant changes in the final rule, making the Accountable Care Organization program more attractive to these participants. However, none of these changes addressed the serious concerns raised by subspecialty societies-including the American Society of Nephrology-regarding care of patients with multiple chronic comorbidities and complex and end stage conditions. Virtually all of these concerns remain unaddressed, and consequently, Accountable Care Organizations will require guidance and partnership from the nephrology community to ensure that these patients are identified and receive the individualized care that they require. Although the final rule fell short of addressing the needs of patients with kidney disease, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation presents an opportunity to test the potentially beneficial concepts of the Accountable Care Organization program within this patient population.

In this review, different electronic modalities used to deliver nephrology care are reviewed and critiqued, with a focused analysis from the Australian and United States perspectives. Both countries are geographically expansive with significant rural populations where access to nephrology care is limited. However, their health care systems are organized differently. The Australian health care system is a mostly nonprofit, single-payer system, whereas the United States system is more fractured with a greater proportion of patients covered by for-profit private insurance or no insurance coverage. Videoconferencing is widely used in Australia to manage kidney disease including chronic kidney disease, dialysis, pediatric nephrology, and post-kidney transplantation care. In contrast, the United States telenephrology experience is limited, with most reports originating from the Veterans Health Administration, a single-payer system providing care for nearly 9 million veterans, ∼3 million of whom reside in rural communities. Preliminary reports from the Veterans Health Administration suggest that that delivery of nephrology care via videoconferencing results in clinical outcomes that are at least equivalent to in-person care and improved patient adherence to scheduled appointments.

She protects the patients from every side effect and complication. Saint Marina is represented in hagiography as a victor, defeating the dragon satan, holding a hammer or a cross and wearing a belt around her back in the area of kidneys. According to writers, artists and sculptors the belt is the perceivable means of Saint Marina for the miraculous recovery from and healing of kidney diseases. Therefore, kidney sufferers and pregnant women put belts upon her relics for blessing and then wore them. From the Middle Ages and Renaissance and up to the contemporary period Saint Marina (Margarita) was considered the patron saint of kidney sufferers.

Physicians from Salerno are known to have worked in Aragon, and many Italian medical and surgical texts circulated in Catalonia. By the end of the 15th century it was Valencia that maintained close ties with Italy, and in the 1st third of the 16th century, at the height of Renaissance humanism, the Castilian universities became the greatest Spanish patrons of medicine. Post-Vesalian anatomists were active and many Castilian doctors were educated in Italy. In both medieval and Renaissance Spain the most commonly described renal pathology was lithiasis. The works of Joanes Jacobi (14th century) and Julian Guttierez (15th century) are outstanding, and foreshadow the monograph on lithiasis by Sanchez de Oropesa (16th century) and the work of Francisco Diaz, probably the greatest Spanish contributor to modern nephrology. He devoted 3 books of his collected professional experience to lithiasis, renal ulcers and sores, kidney inflammation and other processes including haematuria. His view of renal anatomy was totally modern, and he strongly advocated autopsy as a means of determining the cause of death.

This laboratory still operates under the conditions of the Nephrological Clinic. In 1964 at the Medical Clinic the first percutaneous renal biopsy was implemented. In 1966 the first peritoneal dialysis was implemented and the first haemodialysis in a patient with chronic renal failure, later gradually all so far known therapeutic methods were introduced which replace renal function and are used in acute and chronic renal failure and in acute intoxication. On March 18, 1977 in the authors' department the first haemoperfusion over active charcoal was made successfully in a patient intoxicated with parquat. It was the first haemoperfusion in the former Czechoslovak Republic.

The specialties of obstetrics, pediatrics, ophthalmology and dentistry were described in the records of the Han and Tang dynasties, and methods of setting fractures and treating trauma were comparable with those of Roman military doctors. Shen Tua (1031-1095 AD) compiled a pharmacopeia and studied acupuncture and the pulses. Forensic medicine was developed during the 10th century by Sung Tse, who also advocated hand washing with sulfur and vinegar to avoid infection during autopsies. The Daoist physicians used androgens and estrogens to treat hypogonadism with therapeutic preparations of placentas. They also had an advanced knowledge of alchemy, claiming to achieve 'immortality' by their preservation techniques. Qualifying examinations for physicians were conducted by the Chinese state as early as the 1st century AD, and later incorporated philosophy and art to conform with the Confucian ideal. Throughout these eras, Chinese medicine profited from contact with western Asia. In ancient Chinese medicine, the excretory function of the kidney was attributed to the bladder. 'Kidney weakness', which refers to somatized depression, was treated by acupuncture along the 'kidney channel'.

While urgent dialysis may be life-saving, mechanical and infectious complications related to the insertion of NTHCs can be fatal. In recent years, various techniques that reduce mechanical and infectious complications related to NTHCs have been described. Evidence now suggests that ultrasound guidance should be used for internal jugular and femoral vein NTHC insertions. The implementation of evidence-based infection-control 'bundles' for central venous catheter insertions has significantly reduced the incidence of bloodstream infections in the intensive care unit setting with important implications for how nephrologists should insert NTHCs. In addition, the Cathedia Study has provided the first high-level evidence about the optimal site of NTHC insertion, as it relates to the risk of infection and catheter dysfunction. Incorporating these evidence-based techniques into a simulation-based program for training nephrologists in NTHC insertion has been shown to be an effective way to improve the procedural skills of nephrology trainees. Nonetheless, there are some data suggesting nephrologists have been slow to adopt evidence-based practices surrounding NTHC insertion.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12579409/,Twenty-one years of developmental nephrology: the kidney then and now,"Developmental renal physiology was guided for a long time by the notion that the ""immature"" kidney is characterized by glomerular-tubular imbalance, with glomerular preponderance. In accordance with this concept, the filtering capacity of the developing kidney exceeds the ability of the renal tubules to handle the filtrate, resulting in the urinary loss of substances such as amino acids and bicarbonate. Estimates of age-related changes in glomerular volume, based on measurements of glomerular diameter, and of proximal tubular volume, based on measurements of tubular length and tubular diameter, appeared to support this contention. The experimental approach that led to these conclusions was based on the assumptions that the increase in glomerular size is distributed evenly between the vascular and nonvascular elements and that tubular volume increases pari passu with the luminal surface area. Both assumptions were proved wrong. Moreover, micropuncture studies performed in guinea pigs and rats revealed that the proportionality between glomerular filtration and proximal reabsorption of fluid (i.e., glomerulo-tubular balance) is maintained throughout development. Subsequent studies showed that several transport mechanisms function quite adequately from the first days of extrauterine life. Sodium is avidly reabsorbed in distal nephron segments, under the stimulus of the high levels of aldosterone present during infancy. The increase in the secretion of potassium that would occur in the adult under these circumstances is mitigated by the low expression of potassium channels. In the case of phosphate, there is enhanced reabsorption, particularly at the level of the proximal tubule, due in part to a growth-specific NaPi type II transporter. These different adaptive mechanisms converge towards the maintenance of a positive external balance for substances that are essential to growth. The emergence of cellular and molecular biology has also encouraged research in the field of renal morphology. The genes that control mesenchymal-epithelial interactions and the signaling factors that mediate their effect have been described. Progress is being made in the identification of genes involved in certain forms of renal malformations. Novel methods of investigation, such as DNA arrays, are likely to lead to an even fuller, dynamic portrayal of gene expression during nephrogenesis. Characterizing the functional correlates of these genes will require investigators who are not only proficient in molecular biology, but who are also masters of physiological methods.",,Adrian Spitzer

The caldron was formed by the tensions arising from newly formed organizations such as the AHA (including NYHA and WHA), NIH, ISN, ASN, ASAIO and NKF. Without these tensions, nephrology might have become a much smaller and narrower specialty of clinical physiology, salt and water and acid-base metabolism.

Percutaneous needle renal biopsy was introduced after first, the successful liver biopsy and second, demonstration of the value of aspiration needle biopsy in tumours of the kidney. In addition, a number of physicians obtained renal tissue by accident and without problems during intended biopsies of the liver. Nils Alwall of Sweden performed the first systematic aspiration needle biopsies of the kidney in 1944, but did not publish his results because of an early death which led him to abandon the technique. However, when Iversen and Brun in Copenhagen described their results in 1951, a number of physicians around the world immediately began to attempt renal biopsy, using cutting as well as aspiration techniques. Success was inconsistent and operator dependent: the refinements of technique and needles introduced by the group in Chicago led by Robert Kark, plus their advocacy of the technique and their training of many physicians in its performance rapidly led to widespread acceptance. New techniques of immunofluorescence and electron microscopy arrived at the same time so that the technique could be fully exploited. The performance and interpretation of renal biopsies became, along with classical whole-organ and nephron physiology and the introduction of dialysis and transplantation, powerful agents determining the emergence of Nephrology as a specialty around 1960.",,J S Cameron;J Hicks

However, although there is a continued positive trend overall, women remain underrepresented (or misrepresented?) in the main fields of science. In Europe the proportion of women in scientific research is growing faster than that of men, but women are more likely than men to choose education, arts and humanities, health and welfare. Moreover, of the total number of women graduating in all faculties (55%), the percentage of women graduating in medicine is 65%-68%, in Europe as in the United States. As far as nephrology is concerned, unpublished data from the Italian Society of Nephrology indicate that female nephrologists make up almost 30% of the total number in the age group between 40 and 55, and this proportion is even higher in the age group younger than 40 years.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29429319/,The importance of adequate referrals for chronic kidney disease,"Regional Australia remains a district of workforce shortage for nephrology. Thus, it is imperative that patients who have the greatest need for nephrologist services are effectively identified upon referral. The aim of this study was to assess referrals to a regional nephrology service against Australian guidelines by assessing the patient’s renal function and the information contained in the referral document at the time of first consultation. We conducted a retrospective study of all referrals to a regional Australian nephrology service between 2013 and 2015. The 582 referrals that met the inclusion criteria were compared with Australian nephrology referral guidelines. Less than half of the referral documents (n = 253; 43.5%) described a clinical situation that met referral guidelines, typically due to insufficient pathology investigation. However, after consideration of renal functional test results performed at the initial consultation, an additional 82 cases met referral guidelines (n = 335; 57.6%). More than 40% of nephrology referrals to a regional Australian service did not meet Australian nephrology referral guidelines. This has implications for a regional nephrology service that is experiencing workforce pressures, in addition to the health system more broadly, and for patients. Many referrals contained insufficient information to allow differentiation of patients who would benefit most from nephrology care from patients who could be appropriately managed within primary care.",,Julian Wright;Kristen M Glenister;Rebecca Thwaites;Daniel Terry

He was proud and brave, and he presented himself proud of being brave. He opens his interview speaking about his youth, when he was injured, and went back to the fight. He cites the number of stitches he received, but doesn't cite being decorated with the Légion d'Honneur, one of the highest honours of the French Republic. This anecdote perfectly illustrates his elegance and detachment from awards and self-satisfaction. Gabriel Richet was a visionary. He was the first one to use the artificial kidney in France. Together with Jean Hamburger and Jean Crosnier at the Necker hospital, he developed the concept of renal intensive care and, later on, he was one of the first to develop the concept of translational nephrology.At a time when medical writing was not acknowledged, he authored almost 400 manuscripts indexed on Medline. He was over 90 when his last papers, dealing with the history of Nephrology, were published, some of them as sole author.In the interview, as well as in his life, he did not renounce to a provocative self-irony.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9792080/,The future of end-stage renal disease care: nephrology enters a new millennium,"There are many challenges facing the discipline of nephrology as we enter the next millennium. There will be a continuing increase in the number of patients requiring renal replacement therapy, with older, sicker patients predominating. At the same time the available workforce to provide care to these patients is not growing quickly enough to keep up with the demand. In the broader health care delivery system, consolidation of services, vertical and horizontal integration, a continued move to for-profit entities, and constant pressure on cost containment will increasingly characterize the immediate future. The rapidity with which health care delivery and financing are changing will make it difficult for patients and health care professionals alike, but it will also offer opportunities. In nephrology, development of a collaborative model of care has already begun and will be an important part of the response to this changing care environment. Collaborative care and the application of the principles of chronic disease management to renal patients will provide the best opportunities to capitalize on new technologies and treatments as they become available and to streamline and improve the care delivery process. This should lead to improved quality of care for renal patients, while constraining costs and providing for continued professional growth and satisfaction.",,N Hoffart;A R Nissenson

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23921479/,"Department of Nephrology at the Medical Faculty, Ss. Cyril and Methodius University, Skopje--creating nephrology protection for the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia","In January 1975, de facto, the Nephrology Department was founded at the Medical Faculty in Skopje as the first institution of such a type in former Yugoslavia. The Nephrology Department was the driving force for the further development of nephrology in the Republic of Macedonia. D. Hrisoho was the first Director of the Department, and its subsequent Directors were G. Masin, M. Polenakovic, K. Zafirovska and currently A. Sikole. Prior to the establishment of the Nephrology Clinic there had been considerable experience in the diagnosis and treatment of renal patients. The first haemodialysis (HD) in the Republic of Macedonia (RM) was performed in 1959 on a patient with acute renal failure (ARF) using a Kolff-Brigham rotating drum artificial kidney at the Blood Transfusion Institute in Skopje. In 1965 the Renal Unit at the Department of Medicine, Medical Faculty, Skopje obtained a new, modern ""Websinger"" artificial kidney with a sigma motor pump and possibilities for the use of a disposable Kolff ""twin coil"" dialyser. Between 1959 and 1971, HD was performed only on patients with ARF. In May 1971, a Unit for Chronic HD was founded at the Renal Unit and the programme of maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) was started with five Stuttgart Fresenius machines and 12 patients dialysed on twin coil dialysers. That was a great incentive for the development of HD in the Republic of Macedonia enforced by the great number of patients with end stage renal disease. Thus in 2007 we have 18 HD centres in the Republic of Macedonia, with 1183 patients. Treatment of the patients with MHD is the greatest success achieved in the Republic of Macedonia in nephrology concerning patients with end stage renal disease. Prior to the treatment with MHD patients were destined to die, whereas now, with this type of treatment, they have a normal life and families. Patients with kidney diseases are examined in outpatients clinics as well as treated in the wards of the Department. All types of vascular accesses, renal biopsies, bone biopsies, kidney ultrasound, plasmapheresis and other investigations are performed every day at the Nephrology Department of the Medical Faculty. On the basis of the results of renal biopsy, a classification of parenchymal renal diseases has been established, as well as appropriate immunosuppressive and other treatments. The nephrology doctrine for primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare has been prepared and has been distributed to all medical centres in the Republic of Macedonia. The first (living donor) renal transplantation was performed in July 1977. Later, living and cadaver donor transplantations were performed, so the Department of Nephrology was complete concerning dialysis and renal transplantation, and it became part of the European centres for diagnosis and therapy of kidney disease. Doctors from the Nephrology Department are among the most productive scientific workers in the Republic of Macedonia and their papers can be found on the internet Pub Med. The Department of Nephrology, together with the Nephrology Association, was the source of knowledge in the area of nephrology and the transfer of knowledge from abroad into Macedonia and vice versa. The Nephrology Association has made a great contribution in the development of nephrology in our country. The most famous European and world nephrologists have participated in the work of our association and have contributed to the development of nephrology not only in Macedonia, but on the Balkans as well.",,M Polenakovic

Different methodologies of plasma separation include the use of centrifuge, which relies on the variation in the specific gravity of blood components, and membrane-based separation, which relies on particle size. With advancements in technology and clinical insight into disease pathophysiology, membrane technology has become more biocompatible, safer, and more adaptable to conventional hemodialysis and hemofiltration machines.

Later on, creating VA became a domain of surgery. Many nephrologists felt out of responsibility. Interventional procedures, angioplasty and stent insertion are mostly performed by radiologists. In 2005, the role of the nephrologist in comprehensive VA care must be newly identified. We know about the value of early referral to nephrologist and access surgeon to preserve venous vasculature. The nephrologist cares for clinical examination of vessels, for an ultrasound Doppler evaluation before the creation of primary VA with clear preference to native arteriovenous fistulae to aim at an early failure rate. Surveillance and monitoring require the exclusive responsibility of the nephrologist and his team. Early diagnosis of VA dysfunction allows elective revision before the onset of thrombosis. There should be an agreement on strategies between nephrology, surgery and radiology. Surgical techniques and skills are to be assessed from time to time.

Consequently, the knowledge of nephrologists and nursing staff on PD has declined leading to a negative spiral in which loss of experience resulted in loss of enthusiasm to offer PD to patients and also in less interest in the new PD developments. All these changes took place while the results of PD improved and patient survival was at least similar to that on haemodialysis.

On this basis, the second aim is to update internist-nephrologists on a number of issues that have been underexposed in the past. Recent patient and technique survival data of PD patients is reviewed, and also the new insights into dialysis adequacy. The presence of residual renal function is the main determinant of patient survival together with prevention of overhydration. Urea and creatinine removal are not important at all when patients are still passing urine. Many early problems with PD are due to the peritoneal catheter and suggestions are made for improvement of its function. The prevention and management of infections is reviewed, and also the regular assessment of peritoneal function. Free water transport is a predictor of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS), which should be assessed regularly.

The Dictionary was translated into French by Denis Diderot, François-Vincent Toussaint and Marc Antoine Eidous, and was revised by Juliene T. Busson, president of the University of Paris. During the translation, Diderot learned much biology and medicine, which he used subsequently in developing his Encyclopédie. Interesting chapters are devoted to urine, predictions from urine, bloody urine, good urine, bad urine, urine portending death, diabetes, dropsy, nephritis, stone, ischury, dysury and urine incontinence. In general their strength resides in their accurate clinical descriptions. The paragraphs on urine are concise and clinically sound, and the description of procedures for urine analysis and the utilization of results (quantity, quantity, colors, sediments and consistency) in diagnosis and prognosis of bloody urine is accurate. The section on diabetes is excellent and is comparable to that of Desault written decades later in the Encyclopédie of Diderot. In the chapter on dropsy (he does not use the word oedema), patients are well described and their remedies are appropriate for the time. The contributions of kidney and liver are clear. The plants for renal treatment can be traced to Dioscorides. Concerning dosage, he is precise and helpful to his readers. The chapter on stones is a real masterpiece, clinically well centered and giving all the pertinent information to localize them, their medical treatment and the risks of surgery. The entry on nephritis is short and rather confusing. Here James even lacks the usual accurate description of cases which could have made it understandable. Blood letting was extensively used in those days, and he is a man of his time, but James was aware of the clinical conditions where it fails. It is understandable that he underlines its role in certain bloody urines in patients with a plethoric constitution.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27074128/,We Restrict CRRT to Only the Most Hemodynamically Unstable Patients,"From the initial version of an extended renal replacement therapy, the initiative to provide safer, more efficient means for detoxification and volume removal in comparison with intermittent renal replacement therapies (IRRT) has been evaluated. As a result, the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines for acute kidney injury recommend the preferential use of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in patients who are hemodynamically unstable or who suffer from intracranial hypertension. The choice of dialysis modality is also influenced by other factors including clinical expertise, and the availability of each treatment option in individual medical centers. In the scientific community, there is an ongoing debate regarding the choice of dialysis modality. On one side, the inability of recent studies to demonstrate any mortality or renal recovery benefit for CRRT, the need for patient immobilization, and prohibitive additional costs impede widespread adoption of the method.On the other side, the physiological advantages of CRRT in detoxification and volume removal and the identified flaws related to the comparative literature regarding CRRT and IRRT fuel this debate. Fluid overload is a recognized and yet clinically underappreciated factor that increases morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU). Continuous renal replacement therapy has a distinct advantage over IRRT in achieving euvolemia and thus the potential for improving outcomes in all patients in the ICU setting in which extensive fluid administration is often obligatory. With this in mind, perhaps CRRT should not be restricted to only those patients in whom their hemodynamic status requires it. This article reviews the current literature and the myths that may influence the selection of one mode of therapy over the other among patients requiring renal replacement therapy in the ICU.",,Kianoush Kashani;Ravindra L Mehta

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30239064/,Renal genetics in Australia: Kidney medicine in the genomic age,"There have been few new therapies for patients with chronic kidney disease in the last decade. However, the management of patients affected by genetic kidney disease is rapidly evolving. Inherited or genetic kidney disease affects around 10% of adults with end-stage kidney disease and up to 70% of children with early onset kidney disease. Advances in next-generation sequencing have enabled rapid and cost-effective sequencing of large amounts of DNA. Next-generation sequencing-based diagnostic tests now enable identification of a monogenic cause in around 20% of patients with early-onset chronic kidney disease. A definitive diagnosis through genomic testing may negate the need for prolonged diagnostic investigations and surveillance, facilitate reproductive planning and provide accurate counselling for at-risk relatives. Genomics has allowed the better understanding of disease pathogenesis, providing prognostic information and facilitating development of targeted treatments for patients with inherited or genetic kidney disease. Although genomic testing is becoming more readily available, there are many challenges to implementation in clinical practice.

At its heart is a primary care practice that provides comprehensive, coordinated, high-quality, personalized care.

Nephrologists will have an opportunity to practice within this framework, either as the PCMH itself or, more likely, as ""neighbors"" to the ""home."" The effective and enthusiastic participation of nephrologists and other specialists will depend on the details of the model, not the least important of which is the financial structure. Dozens of demonstration projects around the country are currently testing the model. If the PCMH model proves to be workable and is widely adopted, nephrologists could be uniquely positioned to participate, given our long experience providing coordinated care for complex patients in a quality-conscious environment.",,Lawrence S Weisberg

Conventional nephrology training programs provide the fellows with the necessary core knowledge to provide general care for patients with renal and cardiovascular diseases. However, there is a need for focused training of interested physicians to master the specialized aspects of these exceedingly common clinical scenarios and optimize the care of such patients. A cardionephrology-focused training can add value to the nephrology subspecialty and potentially increase its attractiveness for a significant subset of trainees. Herein, we provide a proposal for the framework and content of such an educational activity. Creation of an international multidisciplinary workgroup to formulate a comprehensive curriculum for a dedicated cardionephrology track would be the first step. A variety of practical aspects such as implementation methods, the identification of the required skills, and the development of educational assessment tools are discussed. While this proposal primarily focuses on the integration of the curriculum into the training of nephrology fellows, it would also be appropriate (albeit in a modified and customized format) for a wider range of trainees, including cardiology fellows.",Cardionephrology; Curriculum; Education; Workgroup.,Amir Kazory;Peter A McCullough;Janani Rangaswami;Claudio Ronco

The importance of playing a prominent role in national and regional policy-making for healthcare professionals derives from the need to render the interventions of health policy more suitable to different territories. A review of all official regional healthcare plans approved in Italy until February 2009 has been carried out with the aim of recording the level of inclusion of nephrology in regional healthcare programming. The attention to kidney diseases has been delineated according to six levels of relevance: (i) the mere inclusion of nephrology in the plan, (ii) the level of priority of nephrology among other areas of intervention, (iii) the presence of new dedicated programs, (iv) the reinforcement of ongoing programs, (v) the allocation of specific resources, and (vi) the existence of nephrology networks. Nephrology does not turn out to be one of the priorities of intervention within the regional frameworks, with the exception of some regions which were found to be particularly sensitive to issues of outpatient care. Ad hoc measures for (i) the allocation of resources, (ii) the activation and (iii) the reinforcement of specific networks or programs were documented in a few cases. Nephrology is still too scarcely included in regional programming, considering the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in Italy.

However, the education of nephrology fellows in palliative care has not been assessed. We surveyed second-year nephrology fellows to assess the quantity and quality of teaching they received in palliative medicine and also asked about their preparedness to manage patients at the end of life. A 63% survey response rate yielded 173 surveys for evaluation. Nearly all fellows (99%) agreed that physicians have a responsibility to help patients at the end of life; half thought it was very important to learn how to care for dying patients. On a 10-point scale in which 0 is no teaching and 10 is a lot of teaching, fellows reported significantly less teaching in end-of-life care (mean score, 3.8 +/- 2.6) than in managing a patient with distal renal tubular acidosis (mean score, 6.3 +/- 2.5) or on hemodialysis therapy (mean score, 8.9 +/- 1.5; all P < 0.0001). Specific palliative care content areas were taught infrequently; only 22% of fellows were taught how to tell a patient he or she is dying. Fellows who had contact with a palliative care specialist reported more education on end-of-life issues and believed they were better prepared to provide such care. Fellows' palliative care experiences during fellowship frequently occurred without attending nephrologist supervision; 32% of fellows had conducted 2 or fewer family meetings, and 26% of all family meetings occurred without an attending nephrologist. Fellows believed they were best prepared to manage a patient on hemodialysis therapy (mean score, 8.9 +/- 1) and least prepared to manage a patient at the end of life (mean score, 6.1 +/- 2; P < 0.0001). Our results show that most nephrology fellows believe they should learn how to care for dying patients, but most fellowship programs do not offer this training.

An analysis based on discharge reports from nephrology wards of Italian hospitals has been conducted for the last biennium available (2005-2006) in the ministerial database of hospital discharge reports that classifies the main diagnoses into diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) according to a national classification system. All discharges from nephrology wards were defined as nephrological. Taking this first sample as the starting point, further analyses were carried out on the 20 most frequent DRGs identified. The aim was to clarify the position of nephrology within the national hospital activity. The nephrological activity proved to be concentrated on the first four DRGs (59%). The first 20 DRGs accounted for 80% of the total activity, while the remaining 400 DRGs were fragmented, each representing less than 1% of the total activity. Analyzing the same data cross-sectionally, we see that the ''nephrology market'' is ''owned'' by nephrology wards for only 18% of the total. Nephrology does not have a precise position in the hospital activities and shows considerable overlap with general medicine and general surgery (kidney transplants in particular). The Italian DRG classification has no specific nephrological diagnosis group; this could partially explain the fragmentation. An improved classification system could help in identifying a more precise outline of the nephrological activity.",,Alessandra Susi
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21677439/,Basics of systematic reviews and meta-analyses for the nephrologist,"Renal practitioners are expected to apply the best available evidence from rigorous scientific research to clinical decision-making and also for policy-making for those involved. Advances in information technology and unprecedented access to data have simplified the process for the search of best available evidence to guide practice. However, it is challenging to cope with the increasing volume of publications in nephrology and other areas of medicine. Accordingly, systematic reviews and meta-analysis have greatly facilitated best practice and effective clinical decision-making. Conducting a systematic review/meta-analysis involves a number of steps that start with protocol development and research question formulation, design and study selection criteria, followed by retrieval of potentially relevant studies, selection of those studies to be included and evaluation of a study's risk of bias. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have both strengths and weaknesses. Many of the perceived limitations of meta-analysis are not inherent in the methodology, but actually represent deficits in the conduct or reporting of individual primary studies. With the continuous proliferation of published renal clinical studies, such publications will continue to be an important resource for clinicians and researchers in nephrology. It is therefore important for nephrologists to keep abreast of developments in this field, which requires some knowledge about how these studies are conducted, reported and how to appraise them for application to clinical practice or policy-making.",,Aminu K Bello;Natasha Wiebe;Amit X Garg;Marcello Tonelli

Nephrologists are familiar with the various extracorporeal treatments (ECTRs) used in the management of impaired kidney function, and their respective advantages and disadvantages. However, these same skills and knowledge may not always be considered, or applicable, when prescribing ECTR for the treatment of a poisoned patient. Maximizing solute elimination is a key aim of such treatments, perhaps more so than in the treatment of uremia, because ECTR has the potential to reverse clinical toxicity and shorten the duration of poisoning.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27082708/,We Underutilize the Leg Graft,"Once hemodialysis patients have exhausted all option for a permanent vascular access in both upper extremities, they are often relegated at many dialysis centers to permanent catheter dependence with all its attendant complications, including infections, frequent dysfunction, and central vein stenosis. This commentary makes the case that thigh grafts are a far superior alternative to dialysis catheters in many of these patients. Technical graft failure may occur in some patients due to severe femoral artery calcification, but screening for calcification by ultrasound or computerized tomography can reduce the likelihood of a technical failure. Placement of a thigh graft may lead to critical lower extremity ischemia, but preoperative screening for peripheral vascular disease should minimize this possibility. Thigh grafts have comparable secondary patency to that obtained with upper extremity grafts. Finally, although the risk of infection is somewhat higher for thigh grafts than upper extremity grafts, it is still much lower than the risk of catheter-related bacteremia. In summary, thigh grafts should be used much more frequently in patients without an option for an upper extremity access.",,Michael Allon

Recently, several retrospective validation studies concerning the utility of the ISN/RPS classification, especially among class IV, were performed. In these reports, reproducibility is improved by the definition of diagnostic term, but the outcome related with classification, especially in class IV, is controversial. We performed retrospective analysis of 99 biopsy-proven subjects with lupus nephritis in our facility using the ISN/RPS classification. The class IV-G group tended to exhibit a worse renal outcome, but the difference compared with IV-S was not significant. In a Cox proportional hazards models, Independent histological predictors of poor renal outcome were extracapillary proliferation, glomerular sclerosis and fibrous crescents, while hyaline thrombi and fibrous adhesions were of favorable renal outcome.

The fear is not only related to changes in the working activities, but to the fact that these changes are perceived as being driven by purely economic laws in an attempt to save money. This generates a sense of uncertainty, which is never constructive. Chronic dialysis seems to be at particular risk. Nephrologists fear that dialysis will be undervalued as merely a routine technical procedure. The disappearance of chronic dialysis from the nephrology department is felt as a weakening of the system, leading ultimately to its incorporation into the broader system of internal medicine. In order to gain insight into the possible new organization of nephrology and dialysis activities, the Italian Society of Nephrology has launched a study titled ''Dialysis as a System Integrated into Nephrology Care'' in collaboration with CERGAS-Bocconi University of Economics, the Center for the Management of Health Care, and CUSAS-University of Florence. The study is aimed at comparing, by on-site investigation, different approaches to the management of nephrology and dialysis care offered in five centers representative of various Italian regions. Its final objective is to find ways to reconcile patients' needs with financial considerations. The Italian Society foresees the need for a strong coordination among various, apparently heterogeneous activities (from outpatient clinic to chronic dialysis care, kidney transplantation and follow-up of transplant recipients). Instead of moving towards a fragmented whole of individual entities, the care for kidney patients has to be perceived as a service devoted to a single disease entity which requires the activation of the entire service network. The nephrologist should have the responsibility for the entire process for the benefit of the patient.",,Rosanna Coppo

And, in these countries, the percent of patients with end-sage renal disease maintained on CPD is less than nephrologists think is appropriate. The reasons for these problems are uncertain, but it is likely that difficulties with the structural organization of CPD facilities play a contributory role. This paper discusses the structural requirements for a successful CPD program, focusing attention on the following domains: (1) adequate chronic kidney disease education, (2) provision and support of physician training in the principles and practice of CPD, (3) adequate size and organization of CPD centers, (4) development of appropriate support systems within the CPD facility, and (5) development of appropriate continuous quality improvement programs to monitor a variety of domains, including adequacy of dialysis, peritonitis rates, catheter infections and problems, psychosocial status of patients, etc.",,F O Finkelstein
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15496144/,Acceptance and rejection: cost-effectiveness and the working nephrologist,"While many nephrologists have developed a sophisticated approach to appraising clinical trials, an equal comfort in critiquing cost-effectiveness literature is often lagging. Readers can wonder how new results compare to those from other cost-effectiveness trials, and whether they should accept a new intervention as cost-effective or reject it as too costly for the benefit it produces. Critical readers should first judge whether the authors have made the correct trade-off between complexity and generalizability when selecting a study perspective, and should examine the method of linkage between costs and effectiveness. The most popular method is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which has limitations that have led some authors to prefer the net monetary benefit (NMB), where confidence intervals are more easily determined and which can more readily be used in regression analyses. Interpretation of the ICER and NMB require the choice of a cost-effectiveness ceiling, representing the maximum that society would be willing to pay for an incremental health benefit, and the development of a decision rule based on this maximum. Comparing cost-effectiveness studies from different disciplines requires the use of ""universal"" effectiveness measures, such as the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). An understanding of study perspective, the relative strengths of different cost-effectiveness measures, the methods for measuring uncertainty in these estimates, and how to select and use cost-effectiveness ceiling ratios will help the critical reader to determine if a new intervention should be accepted or rejected.",,Philip A McFarlane;Ahmed M Bayoumi
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29738040/,Nephrologists between power and vulnerability in times of technology,"The doctor-patient relationship is often discussed from the perspective of patient vulnerability. Little attention is given to the vulnerability of nephrologists in their professional practice, a reality often affected by profound cultural transformation arising from technological development. Nephrology is based on research and procedure instrumentalization, both permeated with technology. In addition, the relationship between nephrologists and institutions is governed by market rules. Recent data showed a shortage of new nephrologists and the need to improve the technical training of new professionals, foster the establishment of interventional nephrology, and attract more graduating physicians to this medical specialty. Bioethics offers a different perspective on the issue, since it takes the subjective concerns of medical doctors and the social environments they participate in into consideration in order to enhance their ethical autonomy. These ideas may be discussed as part of undergraduate or specialization programs, thus reinforcing the acknowledgement of vulnerability as a condition and of the relevance of adopting a reflective attitude toward the events of everyday life that interact with the morality of nephrologists, so that risks are adequately faced having bioethical parameters as a reference.",,José Miguel Viscarra Obregón;Marcio Fabri Dos Anjos

In addition, and perhaps with more impact, governmental regulations in the United States and their consequential influences on dialysis provider organizations have made the practice of incrHD more difficult than traditional thrice weekly in-center HD. IncrHD is critically dependent on the amount of residual kidney function (RKF) as well as the individualized goals of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) management. RKF has to be assessed frequently and dialysis adjusted accordingly. Home HD lends itself to an incremental approach more so than in-center HD. This may be due to more experience of the provider, more knowledge of the therapy by the patient and family, the availability of dialysis platforms conducive to incrHD, and/or that its less onerous regulation by the government.

In the United States and Canada, a financial premium is often paid to programs and providers for caring for patients with Stage 4 to 5 CKD (not on dialysis) and is justified by the intensive care required by these patients, particularly in preparation for dialysis. About half of all patients with CKD Stages 3 and 4 never progress to kidney failure, and more than a quarter of them have stable kidney function for years. Among patients with Stage 3 CKD, even fewer progresses to kidney failure but small subpopulations with certain characteristics (eg, younger age, higher levels of proteinuria) have a more predictable trajectory. Clearly, a more robust method of screening patients for nephrology referral and subsequent enrollment into multidisciplinary clinics is needed to provide better efficiency within the health care system. The Kidney Failure Risk Equation is a generalizable CKD risk prediction model that has been externally validated and allows for the efficient risk-based triaging of nephrology referrals with a significant benefit to decreasing wait times. It is also efficiently used in a multidisciplinary kidney disease clinic with aiding timing in modality planning and frequency of follow-ups. The overall potential benefit of this system should allow for appropriate allocation of human resources to those at highest risk to yield optimal care in the most cost-effective manner to the health care system.",CKD care; Interprofessional; Risk prediction.,Peter Wojciechowski;Navdeep Tangri;Claudio Rigatto;Paul Komenda

Especially within initiatives that link payment or reputation to indicator measurement, this balancing should be done with utmost care to avoid potential, unintended consequences. Furthermore, we suggest consideration of (i) a causal chain-i.e. subsequent aspects of care connected by evidence-based links-as a starting point for composing a performance indicator set and (ii) adequate case-mix adjustment, not only of (surrogate) outcomes, but also of process indicators in order to obtain fair comparisons between facilities and within facilities over time.",nephrology; quality indicators; quality of health care.,Sabine N van der Veer;Wim van Biesen;Cécile Couchoud;Charles R V Tomson;Kitty J Jager

Because of their unique clinical perspective on dialysis access and better understanding of the intricacies of renal replacement therapy, nephrologists are ideally suited for this activity. Two areas are the main focus of attention by these specialists: vascular access education and access-related percutaneous interventions. Vascular access-related procedures commonly performed by nephrologists include percutaneous balloon angioplasty for vascular access stenosis, thrombectomy procedure for a thrombosed arteriovenous access, tunneled hemodialysis catheter-related procedures and vascular mapping to determine the patient's optimal vascular access. While the performance of these procedures by nephrologists offers many advantages, appropriate training in order to develop the necessary procedural skills is critical. Recent data have emphasized that a nephrologist can be successfully trained to become a competent interventionalist. In addition to documenting excellent outcome data, multiple reports have demonstrated safety and success when these procedures are performed by nephrologists.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15938024/,Stem cells and cardiovascular and renal disease: today and tomorrow,"The traditional view that organs have only limited regenerative capacity has been challenged in recent years as adult bone marrow stem cells as well circulating progenitor cells have been identified to retain the plasticity to participate in neovascularization, a process so far believed not to be possible after birth. An organ that is damaged by ischemia causes the release of cytokines; these act via the flowing blood and stimulate the bone marrow, which then mobilizes progenitor cells to the blood and directs them to adhere to and migrate into the damaged organ. Thus, these progenitor cells most likely constitute a natural repair mechanism that counteracts degenerative or aging processes. On the basis of encouraging experimental data, first clinical trials have been established to demonstrate the safety and the feasibility of progenitor cell therapy in case of peripheral artery disease or myocardial infarction. Trials investigating injection of bone marrow or circulating progenitor cells into the coronary artery after an acute myocardial infarction not only demonstrates safety of the procedure but also gave hints toward efficacy. Nevertheless, these findings have to be validated by subsequent larger, prospective, randomized, controlled trials. There are also potential topics in nephrology, where modification of progenitor cell activity might be of benefit, such as renal ischemic disease, glomerular disease, and renal transplant vasculopathy. Finding a way to integrate the principle of progenitor cell action into therapeutic efforts might provide a completely new therapeutic strategy that not only attempts to retard disease progression but furthermore targets to regenerate damaged organs.",,Volker Schächinger;Andreas M Zeiher

Second, it involves shifting the burden of caring for sicker (and less financially attractive) patients to other nephrologists and dialysis units that do not practice cherry picking, creating injustices in the health care system. Finally, it treats patients as mere means through which nephrologists achieve reimbursement instead of as persons possessing dignity and deserving of respect.",,J Clint Parker
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12874475/,Newly developed techniques to study and diagnose acute renal failure,"Progress in treating human acute renal failure (ARF) is dependent on developing techniques that allow for the rapid diagnosis, quantification of injury, further understanding of the pathophysiology, and the effects of therapy. Therefore, four techniques that will facilitate this progress are described and illustrated by four different investigative teams. Techniques to measure rapid changes in GFR are available for rapid diagnosis and quantification of ARF in humans. State-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) presently allows for enhanced resolution of regional renal blood flow and functional evaluations in patients. Furthermore, new probes and techniques for MRI that allow for identification and quantitation of inflammation, applicable to human ARF, are being developed and tested in animal models. Finally, two-photon microscopy will allow for four-dimensional cellular and subcellular studies in animal models of ARF providing rapid insights into pathophysiology and the therapeutic effects of a variety of promising agents. Further development and utilization of these techniques, especially in concert with genetic, proteomic, and molecular approaches, will allow for needed insights into the pathophysiology and therapy in human ARF.",,Pierre C Dagher;Stefan Herget-Rosenthal;Stefan G Ruehm;Sang-Kyung Jo;Robert A Star;Rajiv Agarwal;Bruce A Molitoris
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2803433/,Assessing university nephrology training as preparation for community consultative practice,"The authors gathered information about the consultative practice of nephrology in a community environment and used this information to speculate about improvements that could be made in the training of nephrologists in academic medical centers, based on their knowledge of such training. Data were gathered on the specialty affiliations of the physicians who requested 211 consecutive consultations, on the clinical problems encountered, and on the most likely diagnosis for each problem. In some instances the referral patterns, patient mixes, and clinical diagnoses observed in the community-based practice differed significantly from those often emphasized in training programs in academic medical centers. Such differences may be unintentionally reinforced, because the clinical literature in which new findings are reported and validated largely arises from university-type clinical practices. Specific examples of the differences observed and some suggestions for change are given. Although additional research is needed to confirm the findings of this study, and although these findings may not be applicable to other settings or other internal medicine subspecialties, these findings raise questions about the appropriateness of completely university-based training in preparing physicians for practice in a community setting. The authors suggest that cooperation between community hospitals and established university programs could bring about the best opportunities for clinical training.",,R S Muther;M Murray;W M Bennett
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20432218/,[Nurses and nephrology in Italy],"An acceleration in the professionalization of Italian nurses has taken place in recent years. This pattern, together with the increasing prevalence of kidney diseases and the decreasing number of active nephrologists, makes a new collaborative structure between nurses and nephrologists both possible and welcome. This article describes the recent changes and future prospects of the Italian nursing profession. Observations about nephrology are based on interviews conducted with key opinion leaders of nursing in nephrology and dialysis. Italian nurses have recently acquired a status of professional autonomy. Nursing training is now fully integrated in the university system and nurses have obtained more responsibilities and a higher status within healthcare organizations. Future developments may be related to the internal articulation of the profession, supported by master courses and specialist training. Another possible evolution refers to the ongoing restructuring of the healthcare system with an emphasis on nursing activities and skills rather than medical specialties, which will lead to new and stronger managerial roles for nurses. The increase in the prevalence of kidney diseases and the declining number of nephrologists will result in a change in the distribution and utilization of nephrology services. The professionalization of nurses allows a new work division with a task shift from doctors to nurses. Italian nephrologists should seek a preferential relationship with the nursing profession, also considering the nursing shortage in several regions. Possible means to accomplish this preferential relationship could be, in addition to task shifting, nurses' involvement in research, and support for postgraduate training.",,Carlo De Pietro

For the past several decades Dr. Rosivall has been a charismatic leader of academic institutions, national and international societies, foundations in physiology, nephrology and hypertension, but the most important of his many contributions, is his role as a scientist. He earned his MD with Summa cum Laude at Semmelweis University (1973) and was invited immediately after that to join the laboratory of Hársing. He studied the distribution of intra-renal blood flow employing then state-of-the-art methods as well as developed his own technique at Semmelweis University and at the University of Bergen with Knut Aukland. This led to his PhD thesis and degree in 1980. An important determinant of his early basic scientific training and development was his postdoctoral research fellowship and later many visiting professorships in the Nephrology Research and Training Center (NRTC) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA between 1981 and 1983. Actually, this research fellowship not only impacted his own future career, but it also cleared the path for many other young Hungarian scientists who later trained with Dr. Rosivall and then at UAB. The early 1980s were the years of significant scientific discoveries and the NRTC team at UAB made important contributions by their studies on renal and glomerular hemodynamics, the renin-angiotensin system (12, 19, 22) and by the development of classic experimental techniques like renal micropuncture, microperfusion, and the juxtamedullary nephron preparation (3) that are still being used worldwide. When Dr. Rosivall joined UAB in the 1980s, the team at the NRTC included Drs. Navar, Bell, Inscho, Carmines, Casellas, and Oparil, among many others, who share their fond memories of working with Dr. Rosivall in this article.",,János Peti-Peterdi;L G Navar;P Darwin Bell;D Casellas;P K Carmines;E W Inscho;S Oparil

Data for much of the developing world are often unavailable, but given the prevalence of poor socioeconomic factors, the incidence is likely to be greater. In Sub-Saharan Africa, economic and manpower factors dictate a conservative approach to therapy in most instances. The majority of those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) perish because of the lack of funds, as very few can afford regular maintenance dialysis and renal transplantation is often not available. Hemodialysis (HD) remains the most common modality of management, with a very few units offering peritoneal dialysis (PD). Limitations to regular maintenance HD include the paucity of dialysis units, restriction of those units to urban centers, and the absence of government funding or subsidy and health insurance to cover the relatively high costs of dialysis. The few available units are bedeviled with multiple problems: old machines frequently break down, absence of adequate maintenance technical support and spare parts, and frequent power outages. Staff motivation and remuneration are equally poor with consequent disruption of services due to industrial action and emigration of trained staff to the Middle East and Western world. Present avenues for improvements include: focusing on prevention to stem the high prevalence of ESRD, greater government involvement to better fund units and thus enhance the quality of services rendered, and the wider availability of transplantation.",,Ebun L Bamgboye

Since then, nephrologists and cardiologists realized the utility of a tight cooperation among them and organized an agenda of scientific meetings which take place every two years within European countries. The cooperation was strengthened by daily observation which shows renal replacement therapy had solved many problems but imposed or added new disorders to cardiovascular system. Soon, the nephrologists learned that hemodialyisis techniques had not only blood detoxification effect but also cardiovascular consequences. Therefore, the nephrologists started to adopt cardiological tools and apply them to renal patients. The cardiologists realized that in some aspects kidney patients are different from non-renal cardiological patients and have to be treated differently. In Assisi Cardionephrology meetings a clear message was launched: the necessity to bring nephrologists and cardiologists together with the potential benefit of learning from others experiences and transferring the outcome for the benefit of our patients. As result, many foundations and journals have been emerged on this topic. Is there a future for Cardionephrolgy?

His main scientific contributions were: - Investigation of the causes of normoglycaemic glycosuria. Of this condition he collected, from 1939 on, a large series of patients whom he also investigated - for the first time in the world - with renal biopsy and - thanks to a collaboration with Jean Oliver - the microdissection of the nephron. - Introduction, in the early 1960s, of a low protein diet for the patients with chronic renal failure. This, thanks to the stud-ies published by Monasterio co-workers Quirino Maggiore and Sergio Giovannetti, was largely used in Italy and abroad. - Classification of the nephropathies. This was described in the monograph Le Nefropatie Mediche (1954 and 1970), which had a large impact and today represents a classic of the Italian nephrological literature. Monasterio served remarkably the Italian Society of Nephrology: in 1957 as a member of the founding committee; from 1959 to 1962 and from 1964 to 1968 as President; in 1958, 1962, and 1964 as organizer of the National Congress; from 1962 to his death as the Editor-in-Chief of the official journal of the Society, Minerva Nefrologica.

First of all, the question ""what do we learn from history"" is wrongly phrased. It is from trying to learn about history, from the effort required to achieve a historical and epistemological perspective, that we may learn how people as individuals or as a group solved the problems of meeting their common human needs. Medicine is itself an eminently historical endeavour. There is history in medicine as well as history of medicine. According to Paracelsus, the history of medicine is medical science and medical science is essential history in the widest sense of the word. The word ""history"" embraces the concepts of human nature, the world in which human nature is revealed and the thoughts guiding it through life. If the history of medicine and nephrology is observed in all aspects of their evolution, we can see how it had a beneficial role on the work of physicians by reminding them that, prior to the light of achievement, the discovery of all medical principles is preceded by errors and doubts.

One cannot avoid dialysis, when needed, and the care of renal patients is going to be limited to the final endpoint, without paying any attention to renal science as the way to prevent and treat renal disease and its possible complications. This view faces the recent need of saving money in front of an economy which can no longer support what is not strictly necessary from a healthcare point of view. A scientific society like the Italian Society of Nephrology has the mission to prepare its members to be strong enough to be a valuable counterpart to politicians and economists. The future is based on enabling the next generation to confront a new and difficult time. For this reason the Italian Society of Nephrology has granted a national award to the best research proposed by small and peripheral centers, where the infrastructure is not sufficient to perform high-level research. The aim is to encourage interest in new fields, thereby triggering a virtuous circle of competition and personal and group outcome improvement.

The theory of the 'filter kidney' cannot thus be attributed to Aristotle. The function of the kidney was described as being to separate the surplus liquid from the blood inside the renal meat (not in the renal pelvis) and to transform this liquid into what Aristotle called residuum, i.e. the urine.

Part I: Theoretical bases],"Microscopes and artificial kidneys have greatly influenced both diagnosis and therapy of renal diseases. Nonetheless, in tracing the influence of instrumentation on nephrology, as revealed by daily activity, we have to recognise the influence of science upon medical instruments. It is for this reason that, besides strictly clinical factors, the scientific factors that contributed to the development of modern nephrology have received considerable attention. Nobody can use an artificial kidney without bearing in mind the contribution of many segments of science. Each segment has a hypothesis in its historical growth, development and decline. The notion that the advancement of science was made possible by the increasing reliance measurements and other quantitative procedure is hardly a novel one. Moreover, it is rather obvious that the experimental process and the use of instrumentation played an important role in the history of nephrology. Measurements, experiments and the use of instruments were interrelated and represented many phases of the improvements made in diagnosis and therapeutics. Naturally, in the history and epistemology of nephrology instrumentation we find conceptual mistakes and erroneous approaches to the biological reality. However, according to Popper's teachings, mistakes are good for science as they give an extra kick to its growth and development. Medical instrumentation is an assembly of scientific theories; it also controls medical theories and promotes the development of new ones. In addition, it changed our approach to the patient. In the pre-physical era, medical practice was almost entirely an intellectual process based on medical theories that the patient was not expected to understand. In the period of physical examinations the physician included the sensual dimension (oral and visual process) and made direct contact with the patient. In the instrumentation period we experience the third type of examination, in which the physician went back to the position of having less contact with the patient. This separation is reminiscent of the pre-physical diagnosis.",,M Timio

Data suggest that in centers that are promoting the growth of HHD, their PD programs also tend to be very active. Furthermore, our experience and other data suggest that one should not worry about cannibalizing PD in order to grow HHD. Most HHD patients come from in-center hemodialysis or those patients transitioning from PD to another therapy. In fact, data suggest that in order to promote the growth of HHD, a certain minimal infrastructure is needed in terms of staff.

It also compares current practice with the European Best Practice Guidelines (EBPG) for anaemia management. The European Survey of Anaemia Management (ESAM) was a 6 month, longitudinal prospective survey of anaemia management in dialysis patients. Although most survey data concerned patients already on dialysis, some retrospective data concerned initiation of dialysis and epoetin therapy. These findings led to the Predialysis Survey of Anaemia Management (PRESAM), a cross-sectional, retrospective survey of patients beginning dialysis, focusing on referral to renal centres and anaemia management in the year preceding dialysis. The Early Renal Insufficiency Referral Survey (ERIRS) is a further cross-sectional survey currently in progress, investigating referral practices during pre-dialysis care. Collectively, these three surveys provide a wealth of data about pre-dialysis anaemia management. ESAM included data from 14527 patients, PRESAM from 4333 patients, and data from 724 patients enrolled in ERIRS have been analysed. The evidence indicates that, at the time of referral to a renal centre, most patients have haemoglobin concentrations well below the levels recommended by the EBPG. Haemoglobin concentrations are lowest in patients referred within the month prior to the initiation of dialysis. Most patients do not start epoetin treatment until dialysis is initiated, despite having haemoglobin concentrations below the level recommended by the EBPG for the initiation of epoetin. Patients who are referred earlier (i.e. those under the care of the renal centre nephrologist for more than a month before the initiation of dialysis) tend to have higher haemoglobin concentrations and are more likely to be receiving epoetin therapy. Such patients are in the minority, however, indicating that pre-dialysis anaemia management practices continue to fall short of the recommendations of the EBPG.",,Fernando Valderrábano

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9647892/,New approaches for detecting thresholds of human nephrotoxicity using cadmium as an example,"Damage to the kidneys is one of the primary toxic actions of metals. Nephrotoxic substances not only cause renal disease directly, but they can also destroy renal reserve capacity, potentially placing those people with additional risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and genetic predispositions, at greater risk. To detect nephrotoxicity in people at a stage where intervention can be effective, sensitive methods are needed. One of the major advantages of using sensitive biomarkers of renal damage is that people who may be particularly susceptible to renal damage can be identified early, at a reversible stage of damage, and the progression to end-stage renal disease may be halted or delayed. Various categories of tests can be used to detect effects of nephrotoxic substances on the kidney. Through the use of biomarkers of damage to various parts of the nephron, U.S. and European studies have both shown a similar pattern of damage among men occupationally exposed to cadmium. These studies indicate various thresholds of renal effects, which researchers suggest represent a cascade of progressively severe damage to the kidney. Research into new biomarkers of damage caused by exposure to nephrotoxic substances centers around mechanisms of cell death, including necrosis and apoptosis; mechanisms of cell growth, regeneration, and proliferation, including factors that control cell cycle, influence gene expression, and modulate nucleic acid synthesis; and genetic factors that increase susceptibility to renal disease. Examples of types of candidate biomarkers include cytokines, lipid mediators, growth factors, transcription factors and protooncogenes, extracellular matrix components (collagen, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans), and cell adhesion molecules. Research into new categories of biomarkers may provide additional insights into the mechanisms of damage caused by nephrotoxins.",,P W Mueller;R G Price;W F Finn

He had a diverse upbringing and qualified in Medicine in 1939. He joined the army but was captured in 1942 and imprisoned in Singapore and Thailand until 1945. His clinical care of fellow prisoners was highly regarded. He preserved their clinical records and used them, post-war, to write two Lancet papers. One showed, for the first time, that Wernickes encephalopathy could be caused by severe malnutrition and cured by small doses of vitamin B1. His later academic interests were based on the emphasis he placed on renal physiology. This applied to the topic most associated with his name-Natriuretic Hormone. Whilst de Wardener never isolated this hormone, his early experiments, demonstrating that a third factor other than GFR and aldosterone affected renal sodium transport, were substantiated by others. Hugh had many research interests: pyelonephritis, renal histology, maintenance dialysis and metabolic/renal bone disease. In his later years he researched intensively into the role of sodium and salt in the aetiology of essential hypertension. Hugh was president of the International Society of Nephrology (1969-72) and the UK Renal Association (1975-78). He received many awards and recognitions from across the world, many of them after his (so-called) retirement. Throughout his career he never neglected the care of his patients.

The results demonstrated that both cortisone and adrenocorticosterone could have a protective effect on kidney damage, which could be used for clinical purposes.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27559004/,Treatment of End-stage Kidney Failure without Renal Replacement Therapy,"For the majority of patients with end-stage kidney failure (ESKF) replacement of excretory renal function by dialysis or transplantation (RRT) can extend life and alleviate symptoms. Historically, the availability of RRT has been insufficient and this remains the case for much of the world. However, RRT is now widely available in healthcare systems of higher income countries. Increasing numbers of elderly patients are developing ESKF. RRT in this population is largely by dialysis, comorbidity is high and life expectancy short. Evidence of effectiveness coupled with the burden of treatment among these individuals has raised concerns that health services in high-income countries may have moved from an era of unmet need into one of potential over-treatment. Alongside the requirement to make treatment more patient-centered, this has driven the development of comprehensive conservative care as an alternative approach for older comorbid individuals with ESKF, with the potential for acceptable symptom control and reduced treatment burden. This paper provides a largely UK-perspective on treating ESKF without RRT. Emphasis is on the need for high-quality evidence to inform treatment decisions. Complexities of defining, delivering and improving treatment of ESKF without dialysis care are explored. Quantitative and qualitative evidence are summarized and the relationship with palliative and terminal care examined. A framework is suggested for classifying management of ESKF and recommendations made to improve delivery of nondialysis care in the future. For patients with a poor prognosis, such treatment may not result in significantly different survival or quality of life when compared with dialysis. There is a key need to generate the best possible evidence of person-centered health outcomes associated with the various treatment options for ESKF and to present this to patients in a balanced, personalized way that allows them to make the treatment decision most appropriate for them.",,Barnaby Hole;Sarah Tonkin-Crine;Fergus J Caskey;Paul Roderick

The study identified multiple deficiencies and made a number of recommendations which included improving the training of undergraduate and postgraduate trainees in the management of AKI. The aim of the evaluation was to try and identify the perception of medical trainees in Leeds Teaching Hospitals of the training they had received on AKI. A simple questionnaire was used and captured the views of 73 trainees (including 13 final-year medical students). The evaluation indicated that the majority of trainees were unaware of newly proposed definitions of AKI, and many trainees felt that the training they had received in AKI was inadequate for their needs.

The war in former Yugoslavia negatively affected the development of nephrology and also the connections among the nephrologists from the Balkans. However, there was willingness for further mutual collaboration between the nephrologists from the Balkans. The war in Yugoslavia created hate among people, between the newly established countries, and there were problems with the recognition of the names of the new countries, and so, the nephrologists decided to apply the ancient principle of using the names of the cities, instead of the countries, as the founders of the Association. The main goal of BANTAO is to promote scientific and technical cooperation in the fields of renal disease and artificial organs between the regions on the Balkan Peninsula and the world, to give an opportunity for exchange of experience and knowledge among the experts in the area and to engage in collaborative projects in order to demonstrate that cooperation is possible even on the turbulent Balkan Peninsula. The I BANTAO congress was held in Varna from September 22 to 24th, 1995 (President--D. Nenov, Varna). The II congress of BANTAO was held from September 6th to 10th, 1997 in Struga, (President--M. Polenakovic, Skopje). The III BANTAO congress was held in Belgrade from September 18th to 20th, 1998 (President--Lj. Djukanović, Belgrade). The IV congress of BANTAO was held in Izmir from 14th to 16th November 1999 (President--A. Akcicek, Izmir). The V Congress of BANTAO was held in Thessaloniki from September 30th to October 3rd, 2001 (President--P. Stathakis, Athens). The VI Congress of BANTAO was held for the second time in Varna from 6th to 9th October 2003 (President--D. Nenov, Varna). The VII congress of BANTAO was held from September 8th to 11th, 2005 in Ohrid, (President--M. Polenakovic, Skopje). The VIII BANTAO congress was held in Belgrade, 16-19 September 2007 (President--V. Nesic, Belgrade). The IX BANTAO congress was held in Antalya, 18-22 November 2009 (President--A. Basci, Izmir). The X BANTAO congress was held from 13 to 15 October 2011 in Chalkidiki (President--D. Tsakiris, Thessaloniki). The XI BANTAO congress is being held on 26-29 September 2013 in Timisoara (President--A. Schiller, Timisoara). At the VII BANTAO Congress for the first time a CME Course was organized by ERA/EDTA and ISN/COMGAN entitled ""Frontiers in Nephrology"" with seven distinguished speakers. Very important event in the existence of BANTAO is the appearance of the BANTAO journal in 2003. The BANTAO journal has been published biannually since 2003.

What medical conditions preoccupied Nicolaus Copernicus and whether they included kidney diseases can only be inferred from the extant prescriptions of Copernicus, as no record remains of any treatises by Copernicus regarding medicine. While no prescription penned by him is dated, several are traced to the period of his studies in Padua, Italy. The prescriptions indicate that he was concerned with conditions afflicting virtually all systems and organs of the human body including the kidneys. His personal library included at least 45 books, of which 14 dealt with medical issues. Copernicus used to write his prescriptions in the margins or on the blank pages of the treatises. They were mostly based on Avicenna's original prescriptions. The most common herbal ingredients used by Copernicus as remedies for symptoms of renal colic, hematuria and diuresis were common nettle (Urtica dioica), goosegrass (Galium aparine), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), cubeb (Piper cubeba), common pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo), almond seeds and many others.

Budget means ""who does what and with material and what human resources"" with respect to the constraints imposed by the decisions of the controlling entities, and it is mainly a system of planning and control. Management control utilizes a combined and coordinated synthesis of various company techniques including an auditing system, analytical accounting (or per cents of cost), a reporting system able to change the data gathered into measures of syntheses that can be used to carry out sound evaluations.

This conclusion was based on a 1996 survey indicating that nephrologists devote an average of 35% of their activities caring for ESRD patients. We compared data in that survey with those from a 1991 survey of members of the American Society of Nephrology to determine similarities between the different periods. The 1,590 responders in the 1991 survey (35% of the American Society of Nephrology membership) indicated that 50% devoted more than 75% of their effort to patient care, predominately for patients with general nephrology and hypertension problems. Approximately 69% of respondents cared for fewer than 50 hemodialysis patients, and the majority of respondents felt the maximum number of dialysis patients for whom they could provide adequate medical care would be 50. Most respondents felt that there would be a deficiency of nephrologists in their community within 5 years. Results from both the 1991 and 1996 surveys indicate that practice patterns have not changed markedly; combining results from the two surveys makes it clear that more nephrologists are needed to care for the projected increase in dialysis patients. Because nephrologists should be involved in the management of the pre-ESRD patient, training programs will have to broaden the preparation of future nephrologists.",,W Mitch;W M McClellan

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28898574/,Integrating kidney transplantation into value-based care for people with renal failure,"Healthcare reimbursement is increasingly tied to value instead of volume, with special attention paid to resource-intensive populations such as patients with renal disease. To this end, Medicare has sponsored pilot projects to encourage providers to develop care coordination and population health management strategies to provide quality care while reducing resource utilization. In this Personal Viewpoint essay, we argue in favor of expanding one such pilot project-the Comprehensive ESRD Care (CEC) initiative-to include patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and kidney transplant recipients. The implementation of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) offers a time-sensitive incentive for transplant centers in particular to align with extant CECs. An ""expanded"" CEC model proffers opportunity for robust cooperation between general nephrology practices, dialysis providers, and transplant centers to develop care coordination strategies for all patients with renal disease, realign incentives for all clinical stakeholders to increase kidney transplantation rates, and reduce total costs of care.",business/management; dialysis; disparities; economics; ethics and public policy; health services and outcomes research; kidney transplantation/nephrology.,Benjamin E Hippen;Franklin W Maddux
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16874732/,Contribution of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) to Nephrology,"The Central and Eastern European (CEE) region now consisting of 19 countries with a total population of more than 400 million. From ancient times to recent years the history of this area has been tempestuous with often changing borders, loss of independence and its eventual recovery even after many years. Despite such a complicated history in this region some excellent physicians and scientists were able to establish the basis of modern nephrology. This paper records the development of clinical nephrology and renal replacement therapy in CEE region. Data from 9 countries (Bulgaria, Byelorussia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro and Slovakia) was collected. Mentioned are internationally recognized early nephrologists like: Karl Rokitansky (1804-1878) -- Czech origin, famous pathologist; Sergey Zimnicki (1873-1927) -- Byelorussian physician, founder of the urine concentration test; Sandor Korany (1866-1944) -- Hungarian scientist who described hyposthenuria in chronic renal failure; Stefan Rozenak -- Hungarian working on PD problems, or Emerich Ullmann (1866-1897) - Hungarian, one of the pioneers of transplantation. During more recent years other clinicians working in the region (eg. Jan Brod (1912-1985) -- Czech nephrologist) developed clinical nephrology and renal replacement therapy in the region. Nowadays in all countries mentioned, strong nephrological centers connected with University Hospitals are present and many new ones are coming into existence in regional and local hospitals. Renal replacement therapy was generally underdeveloped for many years, but after political and economical liberation real progress was achieved in this matter in most of the countries. Nephrologists from CEE region, especially from Czech Republic and Hungary, have been very ac-tive organizing many international meetings (ISN, EDTA, ESAO, EDTNA etc) and some of them participate in the boards and councils of these organizations. Summarizing this overview one has to conclude that CEE countries have participated actively in the progress of the modern nephrology, especially during the last century.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9531172/,Nephrologists as primary care providers: a review of the issues,"Considering the role of nephrologists as primary care providers for their chronic dialysis patients requires exploration of a number of factors. These factors include the definition of a primary care provider, the time and expertise needed to provide primary care, the expectations of nephrologists and dialysis patients who give and receive primary care, the appropriate preventive care for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, and the current and future roles of nephrologists within a changing health care environment. Unfortunately, few studies have addressed these issues, and there is little objective information on which to base guidelines and recommendations about nephrologist-directed primary care of ESRD patients. Most nephrologists spend a significant portion (30% to 35%) of their time caring for dialysis patients, and 90% report providing primary care to dialysis patients. Most dialysis patients view their nephrologist as their primary care provider. The increasingly aged and ill ESRD population will undoubtedly necessitate additional time and expertise for care from an understaffed nephrology work force. The increased use of advanced practice nurses and alliances with health care delivery systems under global capitation programs may develop into effective strategies to provide care for an increasing population of dialysis patients. The nonnephrologic health care needs, including specific and appropriate cancer screening and preventive health care protocols for ESRD patients whose life expectancies are significantly less than the general population, are unclear. The issues involved in considering nephrologists as primary caregivers for ESRD patients include these and other related factors, and will be discussed in this review.",,J L Holley

Permanent neurological impairment, terminal illness (life expectancy <6 months), medical conditions precluding the safe delivery of dialysis, elderly patients with poor prognosis, and those who begin ""early"" RRT are categories of patients for whom dialysis may not be beneficial. Successful use of time-limited trials of dialysis may reduce the number of patients who are started on RRT without significant benefit. However, clear achievable milestones and goals need to be incorporated into plans for time-limited trials to ensure that continuing RRT beyond the trial period is appropriate. The lack of information on outcomes and symptom management using a ""palliative approach"" to dialysis suggests this should not be a clinical option until additional study is done and efficacy data available.

Previously performed solely by radiologists as a method with high feasibility and accuracy, recently ultrasonography is being recommended and used by many other physicians in practice. Ultrasonography not only can be used to diagnose and manage kidney diseases, but also is an essential tool in nephrology for the guidance of invasive procedures. This method of bedside ultrasonography by physicians in real time is called point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS). Given the limitations of collecting information by routine physical examination in kidney diseases and the simplicity of performing ultrasonography to examine kidney location, architecture, and restricted pathologies, nephrologists that have been lagging in this area, should join the spectrum of clinicians using the POCUS to provide safe and rapid diagnosis of common renal abnormalities. Although physicians may imagine POCUS as a difficult tool to use and there has been an initial resistance and reluctance to use ultrasonography by nonradiologists, investigations have shown that learning and doing POCUS was possible even for undergraduate medical students during a short course.

The distribution of recommendations by author-excluded reviewers, as a group, did not differ from those by editor-suggested reviewers; however, author-excluded reviewers impart significantly more negative recommendations than other reviewers of the same manuscript (P = 0.029). We further explored whether such differences result from individual reviewer tendencies to give generally more positive or more negative recommendations than editor-suggested reviewers and found no such tendency. Finally, editorial decisions on manuscripts reviewed by author-suggested or author-excluded reviewers do not differ from those decisions on manuscripts assigned but not reviewed by them.

In the 1990s, reported practices of nephrologists' end-of-life decision-making showed much variability. In part as a reaction to that variability, the Renal Physicians Association (RPA) and the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) developed a clinical practice guideline on end-of-life decision-making. To determine whether nephrologists' attitudes and reported practices had changed over time, survey responses from 296 nephrologists completing an online survey in 2005 were compared with 318 nephrologists who completed a similar mailed survey in 1990. In 2005, less variability was noted in reported practices to withhold dialysis from a permanently unconscious patient (90% would withhold in 2005 versus 83% who would withhold in 1990, P < 0.001) and to stop dialysis in a severely demented patient (53% in 2005 would stop versus 39% in 1990, P < 0.00001). In 2005, significantly more dialysis units were reported to have written policies on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (86% in 2005 versus 31% in 1990, P < 0.0001) and withdrawal of dialysis (30% in 2005 versus 15% in 1990, P < 0.0002); nephrologists were also more likely to honor a dialysis patient's do-not-resuscitate order (83% in 2005 versus 66%, P < 0.0002) and to consider consulting a Network ethics committee (52% in 2005 versus 39%, P < 0.001).

We analyzed the present status of certified nephrologists in each prefecture of Japan based on national data. As a result, in 2008, the maximum number of certified nephrologists per population among the 47 prefectures was 5.3 times higher than the minimum number. The rate of increase was not high in prefectures with a small number of certified nephrologists per population, which indicates that the disparities among the prefectures will persist in the future. To analyze how certified nephrologists participate in the community medicine of the 47 prefectures of Japan, we performed an ecological regression study. At first, it was shown that the number of certified nephrologists per resident population according to prefectures in 2007 had no significant correlation with the annual amount paid for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), calcium channel-blocker (CCB), or erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) per resident. Furthermore, to determine what parameters had a significant correlation with the incidence of dialysis in each prefecture, simple linear regression analysis was first performed. As a result, parameters with a significant correlation were the average age of the inhabitants, and the annual amounts paid for ARB, ARB plus ACEI, CCB, and ESA per resident. Furthermore, multiple regression analysis revealed that there were two variables included in the final model which could explain the low incidence of dialysis in each prefecture. One was the annual amount of ESA used for predialysis CKD patients, and the other was the number of certified nephrologists per population. Based on these findings, although our ecological study cannot identify causation, we predict that certified nephrologists can effectively prevent the progression of CKD, and an increase in certified nephrologists will decrease the incidence of dialysis.",,Toshiyuki Imasawa;Takashi Nakazato

In 1871, the osmotic pressure, not so well understood by scientists, was again suggested by de Vries who described the ""plasmolysis"", a phenomenon corresponding to cell retraction when incubated in high molecular concentration solutions. Although the results were not well interpretated, this phenomenon was related to the osmotic pressure. Van't Hoff studied the mechanisms phenomena and compared it to the gas volume/pressure relationship. Dreser measured in urine the cryoscopic delta that had just discovered by Raoult in animal and man, after a water load (-0.20 degree C) or a water restriction (-2.50 degrees C) and calculated approximately the amount of energy required to eliminate water at various different concentrations of solutes. Koranyi used the same methods in disease states. The loss of difference between the maximal and minimal delta indicates a functional renal insufficiency. This was the term first proposed by Koranyi outlining the role of the kidney in the regulation of the milieu interieur and more specifically in the regulation of water and solute concentration. Hyposthenuria, best named isosthenuria, in the range of osmotic pressure usually indicates terminal renal failure.

Whether the earliest medical knowledge of the kidney was kindled in Egypt, by the Hindus in India, in ancient China, or by Assyro-Babylonians we cannot determine with certainty. What is known is that the invention of the printing press (circa 1450 AD), with the subsequent availability of translations of earlier writings plus new text editions, contributed in prodigious measure to the development of the critical and questioning character of medicine. The availability of different book illustration techniques also contributed to the development of medical knowledge. We have examined major descriptions of the kidney in 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century original works, all held by the Becker Medical Library, Washington University.

This tendency for radiology referral by nephrologists has two main drawbacks: 1) No follow-up care from the physician performing the procedure and 2) Loss of required procedure training for nephrology fellows. This study assesses for differences in glomerular yield and immediate procedure-related complications between radiology-performed (RP) and nephrology-performed (NP) percutaneous native kidney biopsies at our institution for an 11-month period. All biopsies were done with real time ultrasound guidance. Further analysis was done to look for any correlation between the number of needle insertions (""passes""), needle size and procedure-related complications (graded on a score from 0-4). A total of 37 native kidney biopsies were performed during the study period. Fourteen biopsies (38%) were performed by radiology while a nephrology fellow performed 23 biopsies (62%). The mean glomerular count for RP biopsies was 15+/-10 and for NP 16+/-11 (p=ns). The number of passes ranged from 1-5 in the RP group with a total of 33 passes in 14 patients (mean 2.36 passes/patient). Passes ranged from 1-6 in the NP group with 57 passes in 23 patients (mean 2.48 passes/patient). Mean complication scores were similar in both groups. However, severe complications (score 4) were significantly lower in nephrology fellow performed biopsies (p = 0.001). Despite similar pre-biopsy risk assessment and treatment protocols with real-time ultrasound guidance of all biopsies, these results show no statistically significant differences in glomerular yield or overall complication scores but did demonstrate a significantly higher rate of severe complications (score 4) in the RP performed biopsies.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9189236/,Renal diseases in the Hippocratic era,"Hippocrates and the medical school of Kos were mainly concerned with the common elements of various diseases and the accurate description of symptoms and signs, as well as their prognostic implications. In contrast, the medical school of Knidos (in neighbouring Asia Minor) and its chief member Euryphon were interested in the systematic classification of diseases according to the systems involved. Galen mentions that Knidian physicians were familiar with four renal diseases, probably the same described in the book About Inner Sufferings, whose author is not known with certainty; most investigators attribute it to the Knidian school (5th century BC), while others consider it to be a Hippocratic work. Both theories are logical and possible, since Hippocrates himself was familiar with the work of the Knidian school and a rival of Euryphon. The first renal disease described in the book is nephrolithiasis with renal colic. Its description is considered a classic one and it is well known for its accuracy and clarity. The second disease corresponds to renal tuberculosis, while the remaining two are somewhat unclear, the third resembles either renal vein thrombosis or bilateral papillary necrosis. The fourth disease, described in the greatest detail of all, corresponds to a chronic suppurative renal infection or a sexually transmitted urethritis, complicated by renal involvement. Some statements concerning treatment follow; they consist of diet modification, physical exercise, ingestion of herbal extracts and surgery, as a last resort. It is therefore evident that Hippocrates is the father of clinical nephrology and that Hippocratic medicine lies at the root of the development of clinical nephrology.",,V Dardioti;N Angelopoulos;V Hadjiconstantinou

There are many reasons why, despite its potential, EBM finds obstacles in expressing its full potential as a tool to better inform health care decisions. Broadly speaking, these obstacles fall into three categories: (i) inadequacy of available information with respect the complexities of health care delivery; (ii) poor quality of clinical research; and (iii) insufficient and inappropriate efforts to promote the uptake of effective interventions in clinical practice. In the first part of the paper, we will discuss: (i) what evidence-based medicine is; (ii) why systematic reviews are the fundamental tool of EBM and what is really special about them; (iii) what are the tools for the practice of EBM; (iv) what its limitations are; and (v) what are the hindrances to its implementation.

Action is urgently needed to address the knowledge deficit. The Kidney Health Initiative has assembled a work group composed of clinicians and scientists representing academia, the FDA, and the pharmaceutical and dialysis industries with expertise related to pharmacokinetics, AKI, and/or CRRT. The work group critically evaluated key considerations in the assessment of pharmacokinetics and drug dosing in CRRT, practical constraints related to conducting pharmacokinetic studies in critically ill patients, and the generalizability of observations made in the context of specific CRRT prescriptions and specific patient populations in order to identify efficient study designs capable of addressing the knowledge deficit without impeding drug development.

Henle's work was not confined to the description of anatomic structures. After he had observed microorganisms in the excretions of diseased animals, he embraced the unpopular theory of 'contagion' as the source of infection, though he himself was not able to prove that microorganisms were the direct cause of diseases.

At nearly the same time in Marburg, Carl Ludwig, unaware of Bowman's findings, proposed that urine formation begins with glomerular filtration followed by tubule reabsorption. The controversy lasted 80 yr. Prominent investigators weighed in on both sides. Rudolph Heidenhain's findings in 1874 swung the pendulum toward Bowman's theory until Arthur Cushny published his book, The Secretion of Urine, in 1917, in which he found the evidence insufficient to prove either theory. In 1921, a young physician, Joseph Wearn, began his postresidency training in the laboratory of Alfred N. Richards. He read Cushny's book and learned how to expose the glomerulus of a living frog. Richards proposed that Wearn use that experimental preparation to inject epinephrine into the glomerulus. Wearn proposed a different experiment: instead of using injection, collect fluid from the glomerulus and analyze it. Richards agreed, and the landmark results of that experiment, published in 1924, settled the controversy.

We also compared the rate of patient referral in an U.S. metropolitan area with a population of 1.2 million, in the first 9 years without the ""gatekeeper"" health insurance system and the next 9 years with managed care competition. Finally, we discussed guidelines for renal biopsy in the child and approaches to treatment as practiced in a pediatric nephrology program of almost two decades. We used the same NIH clinical data form throughout the 18 years of data collection to record clinical, laboratory and biopsy diagnosis, dialysis/ transplantation and other treatment data of patients entering our outpatient and inpatient services. Between 1977 and 1996, 3,150 new patients were examined for disorders related to the kidney. Twenty-one per cent of the patients were in the first year of life and 50% were younger than seven years of age. The majority of the 389 percutaneous renal biopsies were done in children under 10 years of age. In addition, almost half of the 112 pediatric dialysis/transplant patients presented before 10 years of age. Thus, the majority of patients were in the early years of life, with an unique pattern of renal diseases and issues regarding therapy which are clearly different from adulthood. Therefore we concluded that the existing data did not support the proposition that pediatric nephrology training be absorbed into internal medicine nephrology programs. The introduction of managed care competition did not affect the rate of patient enrollment. In fact, the rate of referrals in the latter 9 years paralleled the first 9 years. The factors which contribute to this outcome are discussed. Such data should be useful to those trying to meet the challenges of this competitive era.

His contributions were many: he played a major role in introducing and popularizing renal clearance methods, introduced non-invasive methods for the measurement of glomerular filtration rate, of renal blood flow and tubular transport capacity, and provided novel insights into the mechanisms of excretion of water and electrolytes. Homer Smith's contributions went far beyond his personal investigations. He was a superb writer of several inspiring textbooks of renal physiology that exerted great and lasting influence on the development of renal physiology. Smith's intellectual insights and ability for critical analysis of data allowed him to create broad concepts that defined the functional properties of glomeruli, tubules and the renal circulation. A distinguishing feature of Homer Smith's career was his close contact and collaboration, over many years, with several clinicians of his alma mater, New York University. For initiating these pathophysiological investigations, he is justly credited to have advanced, in a major way, our understanding of altered renal function in disease. Smith's lasting scientific impact is also reflected by a whole school of investigators that trained with him and who applied his methods, analyses and concepts to the study of renal function all over the world. So great was his influence and preeminence that Robert Pitts, in his excellent tribute to Homer Smith in the Memoirs of the National Academy of Science states that his death brought an end to what might be aptly called the Smithian Era of renal physiology.",,Gerhard Giebisch

As Arabic became the lingua franca of scholarship, there followed a second period of assimilation, original observations, commentary and systematization of medical knowledge in Arabic texts, which became the basis of revival and learned medicine in the West in the 12th century. However, not all medical texts of the period were written in Arabic. As central power eroded, provincial principalities arose, and regional cultures flourished, medical texts began to be written in local dialects, particularly in Persia. Notable amongst those and probably the oldest is the Hidayat al-Muallimin fi-al-Tibb (Learner's; guide to medicine) written by Abubakr al-Akawayni al-Bokhari in the closing decades of the 10th century.

The treatment of chronic renal failure: 1) Improve and develop the present therapy: automated peritoneal dialysis at home should be developed. 2) The evaluation of new techniques of hemodialysis in the patient can only be undertaken at the University Hospitals. New experimental procedures can endow the artificial kidney with most of the metabolic functions of normal kidney. This method has not been tested yet in men. 3) The xenografts are very interesting approaches because of the lack of organs, however there are major obstacles including insufficient knowledge of the mechanisms of hyperacute graft rejection, of the possibility of transmission of anthropozoonoses from animals to humans, and of gene mutation of virus that usually are not pathogenic in man; finally studies on the adaptation of the xenograft, which possess different biological parameters, to the human milieu, should be considered. 4) Cell therapy or gene therapy are currently under investigation.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10213806/,The contribution of nephrology to the development of current concepts of disease,"Historians and philosophers of science rarely comment upon nephrological contributions to the development of general concepts of disease. In the present study, I examine this topic by starting from the premises that an idea of disease pervades most human societies, that received explanations of disease vary between people, societies and eras, and that an understanding of renal disease has often reflected general explanatory trends. Traditionally, most students of disease have belonged to one of four schools: descriptive, causal, mechanistic, or statistical. Descriptivists have tended to focus on manifestations, be these of a symptomatic, a structural, or a functional type. Causationists have focussed upon identification of the origins of diseases. Mechanists have emphasised pathogenetic processes. Statisticians have calculated mathematical differences of parameters from the mean ('the normal'), without explaining the reasons for these. Mechanists currently appear to hold the ascendancy in nephrology through their focus upon the links that connect causes with manifestations. As, however, all schools of thought have historically waxed and waned, I question the wisdom of granting any of them hegemony. Rather, I promote an event idea of disease that encompasses the causal, mechanistic and descriptive schools. Such considerations should assist nephrologists both to treat disease and to identify those of their predecessors who most advanced knowledge.",,C R George

Internet resources now provide an unprecedented opportunity to provide health assistance to the developing world. The International Society of Nephrology Informatics Commission and National Kidney Foundation cyberNephrology initiative (http://www.cybernephrology.org) have created e-mail discussion groups (e.g., NEPHROL, NEPHKIDS, and so forth) and online texts and web resources (e.g., the Schrier Atlas: http://www.kidneyatlas.org) that are, in many respects, ahead of other areas of medicine. On the other hand, nephrology is quite behind in its embrace of some specific communications initiatives that could benefit emerging nations: the Health InterNetwork Access to Research Initiative program, which provides free full-text access to medical journals and books in poorer countries; the Global Health Network Supercourse, which provides specially designed online lectures for the developing world; and Internet2/Abilene and similar research networks around the world, which provide reliable, guaranteed bandwidth for high-quality Internet videoconferencing as an alternative to face-to-face lectures and meetings. The intent of many educational ventures in nephrology, particularly in the clinical practice guideline realm (National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes, and so forth), is not just to disseminate information but to change human behavior: physician practice and referral patterns, patient compliance, and so forth. Concepts from the worlds of marketing and entertainment, where the science of changing human behavior is highly evolved, can be used to create high-impact, educational offerings to promote health. They can also be highly beneficial to share Internet educational innovations and future vision across boundaries of medical specialties, which is part of the intent of the cyberMedicine joint venture (http://www.cyber-medicine.org).",,Kim Solez;Michele Hales;Sheila Moriber Katz

However, the numerus clausus introduced in 1986 for entry into medical schools together with a sharp decrease in places available in specialty training have changed the situation dramatically and today several specialties suffer actual shortages. In such a situation, professional demography is crucial to outline possible developments for the medical profession and nephrology in particular. Our analysis of the medical profession as a whole was based on data from OECD (international comparative analysis) and the yearly estimate of the General Accounts Office (Italian NHS employees). For calculation of the nephrologists we used the administrative data of the members of the Italian Nephrology Society (SIN) and a survey run among nephrology units in the Lombardy region. Data for the university system (medical and specialty schools) were provided by the University Ministry. We found that Italy is no longer an outlier in terms of physician density compared with other Western countries. This ''normalization'' conceals the high concentration of doctors in the older cohorts and the insufficient number of new doctors to replace those leaving the profession for retirement or other reasons. These patterns are similar - and often more severe - in the case of Italian nephrologists. The aging and increasingly female population of Italian nephrologists calls for a major task shift of many activities to nurses and other healthcare professionals.",,Carlo De Pietro

After researching disordered haemostasis associated with various clinical conditions, he spent over a year in Germany: in Berlin with Dr. E.L. Salkowski learning urinalysis and at Heidelberg under Ludolph von Krehl studying haemophilics. Back in Edinburgh he concluded that the ultimate cause of haemophilia was an 'anatomical defect in the molecule of prothrombin'. He was the first to monitor the effects on plasma clotting times of transfusion of anticoagulated blood into a haemophilic. In 1911 he was recruited by Ray Lyman Wilbur, the first dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine, to investigate metabolic disorders including jaundice, diabetes and ultimately chronic renal disease. In 1917 he described the 'urea ratio'--the mathematical and conceptual forerunner of clearance formulae--and over the next 30 years developed a combined clinical and laboratory service for patients with inexorably failing kidneys. He devised an effective, rational and individually based dietary treatment--some patients such as Linus Pauling, who presented in 1941 with marked nephrosis, responded completely.

Goldblatt, kidney and hypertension: three steps in the history of nephrology]","The existence of a clear relationship between renal ischemia and hypertension has been widely documented by Harry Goldblatt and his colleagues. In their original papers they showed that gross and persistent elevation of systolic blood pressure could be produced in dogs by clamping both renal artery, or one if the other kidney had been removed. If renal arteries constriction was not too severe, a stable hypertension unaccompanied by more than mild renal impairment was produced. Subsequently, Goldblatt showed that, with severe constriction, retinal changes, arteriolar impairment and left ventricular hypertension could occur. Goldblatt has remained steadily of the opinion that essential hypertension in man is similarly due to renal ischemia occasioned either by stenosis of a main artery, or by organic changes in the smaller renal arteries down to the size of the different glomerular arteries. At first sight, it might seem like a simple matter to correctly identify the chain of events that begins with renal artery constriction and ends with persistent hypertension. Observing that a link was missing in this chain of events, Goldblatt hypothesised that the link was a humoral mechanism. Tigersted and Bergman showed that renin was the missing link. Renal ischemia as cause of hypertension in dogs opened a new chapter in the connection between kidney circulation and blood pressure elevation. This quite unexpected connection is one of the most challenging issues today and clearly demonstrates that the development of Goldblatt's ideas on renal circulation is still important and has by no means ended. Goldblatt, in his epistemologic approach to hypertension scientific challenges, realised that ideas are the building blocks of science: not flights of fancy, not notions sculpted in snow, but enduring concepts. Goldblatt's lasting ideas are more than a function of time and place: they have inherent qualities that have survived up to the present day.",,M Timio
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12027216/,Large-scale analysis of gene expression: methods and application to the kidney,"Characterization of tissue-specific gene expression profiles, or transcriptomes, may serve two purposes: a) establishing relationships between cell transcriptomes and functions (i.e. molecular and physiological phenotypes) under physiological and pathophysiological conditions serves to elucidate gene functions, and b) determination of the totality of genes expressed in a cell seems a prerequisite for understanding cell functions, because the properties of proteins vary with their environment. Sophisticated methods are now available for transcriptome analysis. They are based on serial, partial sequencing of cDNAs (sequencing of expressed sequenced tags (ESTs) and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE)), or on parallel hybridization of labeled cDNAs to specific probes immobilized on a grid (macro- and microarrays and DNA chips). Some methods were designed specifically to compare gene expression under different conditions (substractive hybridization, glass microarrays). However, all these methods require several microg of mRNA as starting material, making impossible, in most tissues, to analyse gene expression in homogeneous cell populations. To get around this limitation, we developed a scaled-down SAGE method (SAGE adaptation to downsized extracts: SADE) in our laboratory. SAGE is based on the following: a) each cDNA is characterized by a 10-bp informative sequence called tag, b) the information from several transcripts is condensed into a single DNA molecule by concatenation of several tags, c) sequencing of individual clones from the library of concatemers, computer analysis of sequences and interrogation of sequence databases allow quantitative gene expression profiling.

The initiator of this new approach was a young physiologist in Marburg, Germany-Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig- and the first document his 1842 Habilitation thesis. Although this thesis was limited to a study on renal function, the impact of this epochal new approach, namely the analysis and explanation of living phenomena solely on the basis of physics and chemistry, went far beyond renal physiology: it revolutionised thinking in all the biological sciences. In this thesis, Carl Ludwig enunciated the principle of glomerular ultrafiltration driven by physical forces alone, i.e., the difference in the hydrostatic and oncotic pressures of the blood in the glomerular capillaries, a concept which remains valid today.

De urinis et pulsis secundum praecepta dionisi,"Due to the intense relationship between Byzantium and the Abbey of Montecassino, which lasted for about three centuries, some of the Hippocratic Medical Texts were gathered by the Roman Catholic Church during the last years of the Roman Empire. Some texts were transferred directly from the Byzantine Empire to the abbey. Some of the earliest texts which were written in Greek and Latin have been lost; afterwards they were only written in Latin and in Beneventano-Cassinese type. They constituted the basis of medical assistance that was given in the ""ospitia"" near the monastery to sick monks and pilgrims needing treatment on their way from Rome to Monte Sant'Angelo of Gargano. The Diuresis et pulsis secundum praecepta Dionisi is kept in Cod. Cas. No. 69 (10th century), pp 551-562, in the Montecassino archive. The author of this text tried to perform a urine examination considering the clinical signs, such as high temperature and pulse examination. The text is thought to have been written by Dionysius, a Hippocratic physician and contemporary of Herophilus, who lived around the 4th century BC.

This work is more than a commentary: it is a text attempting to conceptualise the physiology of urine formation. According to his writing, urine associated to the blood passes 'per poros euritides' (through the porous tubules) of the kidney and is then delivered to the bladder. Commenting and explaining the writing on De pulsibus, he stressed the importance of heart disease on modulating the colour and output of urine and the relationship between fast pulse rate and urine output.

Therefore, we conducted a standardization study for evaluating renal biopsies from patients with systemic vasculitis. Four experienced renal pathologists from four European centres joined in the study. A scoring protocol was devised that required the observers to score an extensive number of histopathological lesions either quantitatively (as a percentage of the total number of glomeruli) or dichotomously (on a present/absent scale). Twenty renal biopsies were scored individually by all the observers, from which the inter-observer variability was analysed. Ten randomly chosen biopsies were scored again, in order to obtain the intra-observer variability. For inter-observer agreement, the evaluation of the quantitative variables was satisfactory for both rounds (0.55 < or = Kendall's W < or = 0.95 and 0.59 < or = W < or = 0.96, respectively, with all P < 0.05). However, the inter-observer agreement for the dichotomous data was poor (kappa < or = 0.30 in more than half of the parameters in both rounds). Also the data on intra-observer agreement showed more favourable results for the analysis of the quantitative data (Pearson's r > 0.45 in more than 85% of the variables in both rounds) than for the dichotomous scoring system (kappa < or = 0.30 in more than half of the variables). It is concluded that even between experienced renal pathologists discrepancies occur in scoring kidney biopsies. Inter- and intra-observer agreement is greater if a quantitative method for reviewing the biopsies is applied that requires the observers to score the tissue specimens systematically.",,I M Bajema;E C Hagen;B E Hansen;J Hermans;L H Noël;R Waldherr;F Ferrario;F J van der Woude;J A Bruijn

Physicians selected to head each section sought further training. William Goldring, asked to organize the kidney section, spent a sabbatical year working with Homer William Smith, chairman and professor of the department of physiology at New York University School of Medicine. The second event was the development of a postdoctoral fellowship program in which medical school graduates, following completion of their intern and residency program, returned to basic science departments for exposure to and training in research in preparation for their return to clinical medicine. The aim of this fellowship program was to introduce the experimental method, which had been productive in the physical sciences, to the study and treatment of disease in man. The third event was the continuous collaboration between members of the Department of Medicine and the Department of Physiology under the chairmanship of Homer Smith. Experimental protocols in cardiovascular and renal physiology developed in the laboratory were carried over to Bellevue Hospital for studies and treatment of patients with hypertensive and renal diseases under the direction of members of the Renal Section. The final step conceived by Saul J. Farber, Chairman and Professor of the Department of Medicine was unification into a single group of all faculty members working in the field of hypertensive and renal diseases in Bellevue, University, and Manhattan Veterans Administration Hospitals. The Renal Section then can attribute its origin and development to the establishment of divisions within the Department of Medicine, the postdoctoral fellowship program, and the collaboration between the Departments of Medicine and Physiology. The establishment of the Renal Section served as a prototype for organizing medical school faculties into teams responsible for teaching, investigation, and treating hypertensive and renal diseases and spawned nephrology as a subspecialty of Internal Medicine.",,H Chasis

Clinicians well grounded in physiology were able to seize unusual opportunities provided by sick patients to elucidate principles of homeostatic control applicable to health as well as to disease. Three examples of such contributions, primarily originating at the bedside, are discussed: the role of potassium in metabolic alkalosis, the function of the parathyroid glands as exemplified by the syndrome of hyperparathyroidism, and the discovery of a humoral factor, distinct from parathyroid hormone, that may regulate phosphate excretion by the kidneys.",,F H Epstein

The reasons for discrepancies that are sometimes reported between systematic reviews and controlled clinical trials are now better understood and may be partly explained by inadequate trial recovery and publication biases. The applicability of evidence findings is not always an easy task on patients level. The example of the low protein diet in chronic renal failure highlights such caveats.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11130255/,Initial experience of a nephrologist-operated vascular access center,"A nephrology practice in Alabama did not feel in control of vascular access management. Scheduling delays, as well as variable techniques and outcomes, leading to high morbidity and mortality, caused frustration with the existing care system for vascular access. Our objective was to develop an integrative system of vascular access care, involving nephrologists along with the other caregivers, and to demonstrate an improvement in outcomes. Nephrology Vascular Labs (NVL), a recent RMS-Lifeline acquisition, opened a vascular access center (VAC) as an extension of the nephrology practice. Both pre-ESRD and ESRD patients are evaluated and treated in the VAC. Treatment is rendered in a timely fashion, to the benefit of the patients. Nephrologists serve as the interventionists. More than 90% of vascular access problems detected at dialysis are treated at the VAC. More than 2000 procedures have been performed over 2 years. Procedures carried out include thrombolysis with angioplasty, fluoroscopy alone or with angioplasty, placement of cuffed and noncuffed catheters, removal of cuffed catheters, and minor surgeries. Success rates have been high. Minor and major complications have been relatively low. Referrals to both surgeons and radiologists are shown to emphasize the role of the VAC as part of an integrative system of vascular access care. Results of a patient satisfaction survey were excellent. The VAC has fulfilled the vision of creating a seamless integration of care for vascular access. Hospitalization rate has been reduced and it is suspected that the global cost of access care is markedly lower than prior to the VAC. Multiple nephrologists can rotate as the VAC's interventionist and jointly obtain good outcomes and have little variability among them. Several reasons for using a nephrologists as the interventionist are discussed.",,J W Jackson;J L Lewis;J R Brouillette;R R Brantley Jr

In 1882, he published novel observations on the mechanism of renal hypertrophy, which he understood to be due to renal cell proliferation. Two years later, he described tubular cell mitoses in the kidney of a patient with tubulointerstitial nephritis, which he interpreted as an essential part of the repair process. His most important findings, published in 1889, were obtained by studying the microscopic anatomy of the kidney with an original technique that allowed the isolation of whole intact nephrons. He discovered that the ascending limb of Henle's loop always returned to the glomerulus from which the tubule originated, and he realized that the early distal tubule passed between the glomerular arterioles. In addition, applying the same method to dissect nephrons in progressive phases of development, he identified exactly what tubular segments originated from the various parts of the metanephric early S-shaped structure.",,I Dal Canton;A L Calligaro;F Dal Canton;M Frosio-Roncalli;A Calligaro

This has led to advocate for the future a nephrologist oriented towards the basic sciences. While nobody would deny that the basic sciences will be useful for the development of nephrolologic knowledge in the next decades, there are very urgent clinical problems in the present that should alert against this attitude. The most actual problem is represented by the new kind of patients affected by renal diseases who are older and much more complicated than in the past. Furthermore, todays patients need to interact with the clinician and require to be informed about the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures proposed. Although it is obvious that a deep knowledge in the basic sciences may be useful in improving the clinical care, the existing situation makes it impossible to propose a nephrologist being able at the same time to take care of all clinical and relational problems of patients with renal diseases and also to be well oriented in the basic sciences. This imposes a choice: If the aim of nephrologist involved in the clinical care is directed to the development of nephrologic knowledge to be applied in the next decades, then it may be reasonable to have more and more people oriented towards the basic sciences. On the contrary, if the aim of nephrologist is directed to offer the best available care to the patients, then there is no choice: no chance for a basic sciences oriented nephrologist.",,T Bertani

There had been much debate about the frequent dissociation between uremia and edema. Strauss revealed that in uremia without edema there was a retention of nitrogen metabolites, whereas in proteinuric edematous patients there was a retention of chloride and water. He concluded that edema was due solely to the retention of sodium chloride. Though underfilling theory was proposed as a possible mechanism for the development of edema in nephrotic syndrome and liver cirrhosis, several evidences against this theory have been reported in these 10 years.

The perspective of the clinical nephrologist","The problem of Quality has three dimensions: the dimension of quality of life (the patients, perspective), the dimension of quality of medical knowledge and of the appropriate use of medical technology (i.e. the ""evidence based"" medical approach to clinical decision making) and the dimension of accreditation of health care providers. The problem of keeping clinicians well updated is a difficult one but there are solutions. The medical literature can be selectively but thoroughly analysed and on the basis of high quality studies specific recommendations (i.e. guidelines) can be produced. Scientific societies are now making major efforts to produce high quality guidelines for the treatment of patients with chronic renal failure and for those on chronic dialysis. The DOQI and the Standards Document by the Renal Association offer first class examples of how scientific knowledge can be translated into clear practice guidelines. As far as the dimension of quality of medical knowledge is concerned, there is now increasing evidence that the taking into full account of quality of life issues such as those regarding the physical, psychic and social dimensions of health improves substantially patient's satisfaction and the patient-doctor relationship. Quality of life considerations are now fully considered when evaluating the efficacy erythropoietin in the treatment of uraemic anemia. If we accept the perspective that health care organisations should aim at excellence, the performance of a given provider can be evaluated on the basis of various indicators and its performance made transparent to the potential users. The internet has become the most accessible source of such kind of information and it can be easily forecasted that the performances of all major hospitals and health care organisations will soon be in the public domain.",,C Zoccali

This study aimed to determine the views of nephrologists on the content and effects of their local guidelines (Caring for Australasians with Renal Impairment [CARI]). In 2006, a self-administered survey was distributed to all Australian and New Zealand nephrologists. Seven questions were repeated from a similar survey in 2002. A total of 211 nephrologists (70% of practicing nephrologists) responded. More than 90% agreed that the CARI guidelines were a useful summary of evidence, and nearly 60% reported that the guidelines had significantly influenced their practice. The proportion of nephrologists reporting that the guidelines had improved patient outcomes increased from 14% in 2002 to 38% in 2006. The proportion of nephrologists indicating that the guidelines did not match the best available evidence decreased from 30% in 2002 to 8% in 2006. Older age and male sex showed some associations with a less favorable response for some domains. The CARI approach of rigorous evidence-based guidelines has been shown to be a successful model of guideline production. Almost all nephrologists regarded the CARI guidelines as useful evidence summaries, although only one-third believed that the guidelines affected health outcomes. Attitudes to the guidelines have become more favorable over time; this may reflect changes in the CARI process or attitudinal changes to evidence among nephrologists.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14737975/,[Demography of nephrologists in France in 2002],"This survey was performed using data generated by a mailing sent with the collaboration of regional coordinators in 2002 to all the nephrologists identified in France. 1326 nephrologists were included in the pool, with an average of 22 nephrologists per million population (pmp), ranging from 14 to 29 pmp according to the different regions. Their mean (and median) age was 46.6 years, 30% were female. 63.5% of the nephrologists were working in a public hospital, 19.3% in private clinics, 13.3% in non-profit associations, 2% and 0.4% in research units or with industry, respectively. The data were used to generate a register of all the French nephrologists. 47 retirements per year are anticipated between 2010 and 2019, which yields an indication for the number of new nephrologists to be certified in this time-span. The gap between the future retirees and the newly trained nephrologists is very deep and cannot be bridged with the currently operating modes of recruitment. The increasing incidence and prevalence of patients with end stage renal failure will considerably increase the need of nephrologists, which is all the more amplified by the recent modification of the French law concerning the weekly upper limit of working time for physicians. Urgent measures have to be taken for preventing the consequences of dearth of nephrologists clearly anticipated for the next 10 years.",,H Nivet;C Maingourd;F Mignon
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8546178/,An unrecognized renal physiologist: Friedrich Wöhler,"Wöhler, in 1828, was the first chemist to synthesize urea. In 1824, towards the end of his medical studies, he had already published an important article on the renal excretion of some 41 substances administered orally or parenterally and on the links between their renal excretion and their metabolism: salts of potassium are excreted either reduced or oxidized, urine can be acidic when the blood is alkaline, the rate of water excretion is influenced by the rate of substances excreted in the same form as they are administered. He adumbrated the general concepts on the role of the kidney in the maintenance of the composition of the body. Had he continued in this direction, Wöhler would have been recognized not only as a remarkable chemist but also as a great physiologist.",,G Richet

In current literature, the work is interpreted as either an imitation or a refutation of previous anatomical knowledge, particularly the treatises by the classical Greek physician Galen (129 -- after 216 A.D. [?]). In this paper we focus on Vesalius' study of the kidneys (Book V, chapter 10). On the basis of a comparison of Vesalius' and Galen's Greek text, we reach the conclusion that Vesalius closely reproduced Galen's model and text, thus re-enacting the ancient practice of medicine and dissection.",,Alain Touwaide
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16267796/,"[Census 2004 of the Italian Renal and Dialysis Units--Piemonte, Liguria and Valle d'Aosta]","The Italian Society of Nephrology (SIN) promoted a national survey in order to obtain detailed information from all Renal and/or Dialysis Units using the on-line questionnaire (158 items) regarding structural and technological resources, medical workforce organisation and activity features. The purposes of this initiative were to obtain regional benchmarks as references for renal units and to describe the current Italian renal network in order to plan further interventions for the next 5 years. In this paper data of the first three Italian Regions (Piemonte, Liguria and Valle d'Aosta) which completed the survey (100% of the units) are reported. Main findings in the 3 Regions. A) Epidemiology: prevalence of dialysis patients = 709, 720, 787 pmp (per million population); prevalence of transplanted patients = 325, 387, 279 pmp; incidence of dialysis patients = 166, 191, 156 pmp; gross mortality of dialysis patients = 13.7, 15.0, 13.0%; distribution of vascular access in prevalent dialysis patients: arteriovenous fistula = 74, 83, 76%, central venous catheter = 18, 12, 15%, vascular graft = 8, 5, 9%. B) Structural resources: hospital's number of beds = 49, 72, 49 pmp, dialysis places = 166, 158, 164 pmp. C) Personnel resources: renal physicians = 44, 47, 41 pmp, renal nurses = 186, 194, 205 pmp; each renal physician takes care of 16, 15, 19 dialysis patients and each renal nurse cares for 3.8, 3.7, 3.8 dialysis patients. D) Activity: admission to hospital = 1507, 2392, 1606 pmp, renal biopsies = 109, 133, 57 pmp. Despite discrepancies in population density in the three Regions, most indexes are surprisingly similar and show the satisfactory level of renal care attained in the Northwestern Italian area. Further improvements in health care management can be predicted as a consequence of a direct comparison between needs and results in the various Regions of the Country.",,S Alloatti;G Garibotto;G Triolo;F Quarello;M Salomone;G Buccianti
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14733426/,Forgotten nephrologists: Leonhard Thurneysser and Hermann Senator,"Leonhard Thurneysser and Hermann Senator are examples of ""Forgotten Nephrologists"". Leonhard Thurneysser was born in Basel, Switzerland in the 16th Century and worked for many years in Berlin. He was a goldsmith, miner, printer, astrologist and uroscopist. He traveled all over Europe. His importance stems from the physicochemical methods he introduced into uroscopy. He prosposed that urine distillates and their residues should be burnt in order to define their composition from the colour of the flame. He developed a overcomplicated system of fractionated distillations and drew more and more speculative conclusions. Hermann Senator lived in the 19th Century. Born and trained in Berlin, he became a critical and experienced nephrologist. His observations of ""physiological"" and ""pathological"" protein excretion in humans became important. Critical oberservations in the hospital, experimental testing of derived hypotheses and careful analyses of derived concepts characterize his work. He stimulated many young physicians to cooperate. Together with Munck he formulated the ""Senator-Munck-Doctrine"", according to which current concepts of urine formation as postulated by Bowman, Ludwig, Heidenhain et al could be and were unified in a ""Filtration-Secretion-Reabsorption-Concept"".",,Klaus Hierholzer;Johannes Hierholzer
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18278764/,"[XIII Congresso Societa' Italiana di Cardiologia 1956, in Trieste and the birth of cardionephrology]","The Author comes recently across the proceedings volume of the forgotten XVIII Congress of the ''Società Italiana di Cardiologia'' held in Trieste on May 1956. The proceedings focus on the ''cardiopatia renale'', i.e. the heart lesion observed in Kidney disease, namely in acute glomerulonephritis. Later ''Cardiopatia renale'' changes into ''uremic cardiomyopathy'' but the terms seem uncorrect as they do not include the cardiac derangement in early stages of nephropathies. The diction ''cardiomyopaty'' in uremic seems more complete. The topic becomes very ''hot'' and the kidney- heart scientific culture grows more and more and culminates with the ''Cardionephrology'' term coined in 1991 at Assisi Meeting and then wide spread all over Europe.",,M Timio
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14733429/,Francis Delafield (1841-1915): the original contributions of an American investigator to diseases of the kidney,"The growth of our knowledge of diseases of the kidney has been the work of brilliant individuals of talent and passion, who have become some of the most respected and best remembered figures in nephrology. Unfortunately, we often forget that in many cases there were others, no less brilliant, whose vision and passion to study diseases of the kidney was no less intense but whose contributions have been forgotten. Francis Delafield (1841-1915) is one of those important but overlooked figures. An 1863 graduate of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, he continued his studies in London and Berlin, and upon his return to New York became a pioneer in histopathology in general and that of kidney disease in particular. He provided detailed and accurate microscopic descriptions of kidney pathology, made a concerted effort to correlate clinical signs and symptoms with kidney lesions and provided a nosological classification of the acute and chronic forms of what was then known merely as Bright's disease. During his life, he was recognized as the American authority on diseases of the kidney and the City of New York acknowledged his contributions by naming a hospital after him.",,Joslyn L Campbell;Garabed Eknoyan
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3405015/,ARCANE. A new medical patient information system,"ARCANE is a new medical patient information system developed at Necker Enfants-malades University Hospital. It was initially dedicated to pediatric nephrology, using microcomputers directly accessible to the physicians. It is however designed for general use and could be directly adapted to many domains in Medicine. ARCANE's referential is based on conceptual slicing close to SNOMED's. The thesaurus is built on keywords or key-expressions. Combination with adjectives and modifiers reduces the volume of the thesaurus to about 1000 entries. Multipurpose use of the data is made available by automatic transcodification to ICD classification and SNOMED nomenclature. External formatting by semantic fields allows the physicians to attribute medical expressions dynamically to concepts of the thesaurus. This system, devoted to daily practice, is also conceived as a clinical research aid and an activity analysis tool.",,P Landais;P Frutiger
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15492976/,Informing patients of the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy: nephrologists' ethical obligation,"As consultants, nephrologists are often in a position to observe and diagnose nonrenal illnesses as well as identify potential complications of previously prescribed therapies. The decision to discuss these types of issues with patients can be complicated by the fear of offending the patient's primary care physician. When such situations pose potential harm to patients, they become ethical issues and the nephrologist's responsibility to inform patients of potentially harmful exposure is clear. Given recent research findings, the use of hormone replacement therapy by many of the patients referred to nephrologists should be reviewed and discussed with the patient and the referring physician. All potential benefits and harms should be clearly stated.",,Lynn R Noland

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11111857/,Economics of an academic renal division: an approach,"Nephrology divisions work within the systems and constraints of a department of medicine in a college of medicine, and in an increasing number of cases, also within a larger health care delivery system. Key to the division's stability are a consistently applied practice pan, how the tenure and clinical track systems function, how teaching funds are distributed, mechanisms of incentive for the division, and its faculty and the ability to establish and maintain reasonable financial reserves, especially for investment in research. Dialysis, transplantation, hypertension, research, and the teaching of medical students, residents, and fellows are the key elements the divisional organization must address. Incentives for faculty performance should be included in all of these areas. The division director must recognize his or her control of earning capacity in the distribution of responsibilities; financial returns as compared with effort involved vary considerably. Three main problems confront the future of our divisions: manpower shortages in nephrology; the effects of managed care systems on nephrology practice; and the future existence and success of departments of internal medicine and academic health centers.",,R G Luke;J H Galla
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14733428/,Charles Edward Isaacs (1811-1860): exploring the details of nephron structure and function in the post-Bowman period,"Charles Edward Isaacs (1811-1860), an anatomist working in New York, undertook a series of studies which attempted to define the microscopic structure of the nephrons in a variety of species. Given that he published his findings 15 years after William Bowman's seminal paper on the subject, he was able to add only a few of the finer details to the picture. He observed the continuity of the epithelium of the glomerular capsule with that of the proximal tubule and he demonstrated that the glomerular tuft is covered by a layer of epithelial cells. In a series of studies on human renal function he erroneously concluded that the glomerulus must have an excretory function in addition to its filtration function and that diuretics act primarily on the glomerlus. The latter conclusion was based upon observations of substances not currently categorized as being diuretic agents. The absence of a major conceptual advance in the writings of Isaacs probably accounts for that fact that his contribution has been largely forgotten.",,Leon G Fine

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3683239/,Performance of a dangerous answer subtest within a subspecialty certifying examination,"Previous studies have been reported suggesting that a population of candidates for specialty board certification can be identified who pass the certification examination but who give an unduly high number of 'dangerous' responses, indicating their acceptance of actively harmful actions. To confirm these results, a retrospective analysis was undertaken of a Subspecialty Board of Nephrology certification examination. Experts identified a subtest of 75 dangerous answers. The performance of candidates on this subtest was compared with their performance on the total examination. The subtest was moderately reliable, ranked criterion groups appropriately, had a correlation with the total test of 0.71, and using the standard used for the total examination, identified the certification status of 84% of candidates. However, when the correlation was corrected for unreliability, the correlation became 1.0, indicating that a dangerous answer subtest, at least in this examination and population, does not identify a unique population of certified but 'dangerous' doctors.",,G D Webster;S Goldfarb;J J Norcini;J A Shea;L N Murray
