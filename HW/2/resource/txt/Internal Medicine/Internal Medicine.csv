Emerging infections and rising rates of antibiotic resistance are determining this trend. Both challenges will need to be addressed in international and local collaborations between different specialties in medicine and basic science. Infectious diseases as a clinical specialty in this scenario is directly responsible for the care of patients with infectious diseases. Its involvement in the care of patients with complicated infections has proved to be highly effective. Antibiotic stewardship programmes are effective measures in slowing the development of antibiotic resistance and have been widely implemented. But antibiotic stewardship specialists should not be confused with or taken as an alternative to infectious disease experts. Infectious diseases requires appropriate and specific training. It mainly uses the instrumentarium of internal medicine. With the current challenges in modern medicine, infectious diseases in Germany should thus be upgraded from a subspecialty to a clinical specialty, ideally within Internal Medicine.","Antibiotic stewardship; Drug resistance, microbial; Education, medical, postgraduate; Infectious diseases, emerging; Specialty, internal medicine.",G Fätkenheuer;N Jung;W V Kern;U R Fölsch;B Salzberger

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27778214/,The Evolution of General Internal Medicine (GIM)in Canada: International Implications,"General internal medicine (GIM), like other generalist specialties, has struggled to maintain its identity in the face of mounting sub-specialization over the past few decades. In Canada, the path to licensure for general internists has been through the completion of an extra year of training after three core years of internal medicine. Until very recently, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) did not recognize GIM as a distinct entity. In response to a societal need to train generalist practitioners who could care for complex patients in an increasingly complex health care setting, the majority of universities across Canada voluntarily developed structured GIM training programs independent of RCPSC recognition. However, interest amongst trainees in GIM was declining, and the GIM workforce in Canada, like that in many other countries, was in danger of serious shortfalls. After much deliberation and consultation, in 2010, the RCPSC recognized GIM as a distinct subspecialty of internal medicine. Since this time, despite the challenges in the educational implementation of GIM as a distinct discipline, there has been a resurgence of interest in this field of medicine. This paper outlines the journey of the Canadian GIM to educational implementation as a distinct discipline, the impact on the discipline, and the implications for the international GIM community.",Canada; Education; General internal medicine.,Sharon E Card;Heather D Clark;Michelle Elizov;Narmin Kassam

Twenty-two residents were tested after six months of their internal medicine rotation and compared to twenty-five residents that had the first rotation in another specialty (control). We showed a significant difference in the improvement of the script concordance tests scores (p=0.015) between the beginning and the end of their first rotation between the internal medicine and the control groups, and this implies the lower improvement of clinical reasoning skills and spontaneous learning slope of the junior doctors in other departments.",Clinical reasoning; Script Concordance Tests; internal medicine rotation; residency.,Silvia Sovaila;Adrian Purcarea;Antoine Froissart;Brigitte Ranque;Pierre Kieffer;Emmanuel Andres;Cecile Goujard;Jean-Christophe Weber;Jean-François Bergmann;Stephane Gayet;Brigitte Granel;Anne Bourgarit

This position paper reviews the history of Internal Medicine, the birth of its subspecialties and the difficulties faced by young physicians when they decide whether to practice as internist or in a subspecialty. In Chile as in most occidental countries formal training in a subspecialty of internal medicine requires previous certification in internal medicine but the proportion of young physicians who remain in practice as general internists appears to be considerably lower than those who choose a subspecialty. The main reasons for this unbalance can be related to financial advantages (by the practice of specialized technologies) and the patients' tendency to request direct assistance by a professional thought to be better qualified to take care of their specific problems.

Nonspecialty-trained physicians will need to supplement the gap between supply and demand. Yet, no uniform guidelines exist for the training of internal medicine residents in palliative care. To our knowledge, no systematic study has been performed to evaluate how internal medicine residencies currently integrate palliative care into their training. In this study, we surveyed 338 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited internal medicine program directors. We queried how palliative care was integrated into their training programs. The vast majority of respondents felt that palliative care training was ""very important"" (87.5%) and 75.9% of respondents offered some kind of palliative care rotation, often with a multidisciplinary approach. Moving forward, we are hopeful that the data provided from our survey will act as a launching point for more formal investigations into palliative care education for internal medicine residents. Concurrently, policy makers should aid in palliative care instruction by formalizing required palliative care training for internal medicine residents.",communication; education; hospice; medical training; palliative care; residency.,Asher Edwards;Samuel Nam

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7598147/,"Subspecialization in internal medicine: a historical review, an analysis, and proposals for change","The recent decline in the production of primary care physicians has been associated with a decrease in the production of general internists and an increase in the number of medical subspecialists. A significant majority of entering internal medicine residents anticipate entering a medical subspecialty. This transition in the development of medical manpower, perceived by some as inappropriate, is analyzed in light of historical trends in the evolution of internal medicine and its subspecialties, and in conjunction with the roles played by the American Board of Internal Medicine and the National Institutes of Health. Evidence is presented that the creation of virtually independent subspecialty departments may have been detrimental to the education of physicians and not productive of the physician scientists they are assumed to create. Current recommendations for reform are reviewed and a new proposal is presented, suggesting increasing the length of the medical residency from 3 to 4 years, incorporating subspecialty training in one or more fields into the third year of the residency, removing ""duration of training"" as a requirement for board eligibility in a subspecialty, transferring the certification of technical competence in a procedure to local institutions, and creating investigational units in basic disciplines within the department of internal medicine that would serve as a resource for all the subspecialty divisions.",,R J Anderson

We studied the outcome of CHF outpatient management in reducing hospitalization after discharge from a division of Internal Medicine at a large 3rd referral regional Hospital. 147 CHF inpatients (M:F: 63:84; mean age 76 ± 9.6 years) admitted for acute exacerbation of CHF were followed up as outpatients at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months after discharge. At baseline, patients underwent: laboratory tests, ECG, echocardiogram and a dedicated-intensive health care educational program involving also their families. The rate of hospitalization in the same group of patients was compared with data from the previous 24 months, a period when patients had been seen elsewhere without disease management programs. Patients had high prevalence of comorbidities and the majority was in NYHA class III or IV. Hypertension and valvular heart disease were the most common causes for CHF. Systolic function was preserved (LVEF ≥ 50%) in 61.9% of cases. Functional NYHA class improved significantly after 6 months and remained stable at 24 months. There was a significant increase in the use of the renin-angiotensin system blockers, beta-blockers and diuretics compared to admission to the ward. At 24 months, hospital readmissions were decreased by 42% as compared to the previous 24 months. Risk factors for re-hospitalizations were anemia, NYHA class III or IV and previous hospitalizations.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31815166/,The development of the internal medicine courses at Hannover Medical School from 2001 to 2018,"Aim: The subject-based model curriculum at the Hannover Medical School (MHH) is characterized by two major features: early and continuous contact with patients and the interconnection of theoretical and clinical content. The progressive adaptations to the internal medicine curriculum which is taught longitudinally over five years are presented. Methods: Looking back on 17 years of experience with our model curriculum and the events leading to its inception, we summarize the challenges and subsequent modifications to the longitudinal internal medicine curriculum. Some of these challenges are likely to occur in other subjects and can therefore be generalized. Results: Integrating preclinical and clinical content was more resource intensive than thought and unexpectedly led to capacity problems since the German courts ruled that the presence of more teachers brought with it an obligation to enroll more students. In response to this, teaching responsibilities were extended to both outpatient facilities and academic teaching hospitals. Major changes included a more even distribution of clinical content in the first year, a rigorous standardization of teaching content in clinical skills, increased adaptation of content to reflect prior knowledge in the third and fourth years, and a focus on clinical reasoning in the fifth year. Restructuring the academic year into three ten-week blocks (two in the winter term and one in the summer term) allowed the retention of small groups. Conclusion: These measures rely heavily on considering teaching responsibilities within rotation plans, curriculum development and continuous faculty engagement. Since teachers are not sufficiently familiar with the distinctions between teaching formats, they mostly consider how far students have advanced in their studies when choosing course content. This implies that the current nomenclature requires improvement.",,Philip Bintaro;Sabine Schneidewind;Volkhard Fischer

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32866400/,Toward Historical Accountability and Remembrance: The German Society for Internal Medicine and Its Legacies From the Nazi Past,"After decades of silence, the German Society for Internal Medicine (DGIM) has made considerable efforts to come to terms with its role and actions during the Nazi era (1933 to 1945). This is particularly important because, with more than 27 000 members, the DGIM is the largest medical society in present-day Germany. Since 1882, the society's annual congress in Wiesbaden has provided a forum and focus for the key medical topics of the day. Based on ongoing historical research, this article is organized in 2 parts. The first describes how the DGIM willingly adapted to the ideology and politics of the Nazi regime, showing no solidarity with its persecuted Jewish members. To illustrate their fates, the cases of Leopold Lichtwitz, who was forced to resign as elected chairman in 1933, and committee member Julius Bauer are investigated. Both men emigrated to the United States. Light is also shed on the decisions of those who led the society during the Nazi era and on the involvement of high-ranking members in medical crimes. The second part of the article analyzes developments in the postwar period and considers why it took so long to hold up a mirror to the past. Although critical voices could be heard from both outside and within the society, they remained isolated and without consequence. Only the past 2 decades have brought about both general and specific developments toward historical accountability and an active culture of remembrance. With a declaration first published in 2015, a new website bringing history and memory together, and a strong commitment to the norms and values of liberal democracy, the DGIM has found its way to a clear position-and has lessons to teach.",,Hans-Georg Hofer;Ralf Forsbach;Ulrich R Fölsch
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33201328/,What do internal medicine residents know about rheumatology? A needs assessment for curriculum design,"We sought to determine if analyzing internal medicine (IM) resident performance on the in-training exam (ITE) might reveal curricular needs in rheumatology education beyond those intuitive to learners and educators from their perceptions and experience. We analyzed ITE scores of post-graduate year (PGY) 2 IM residents at our institution from 2010 to 2017. We sorted rheumatology-related educational objectives on the ITEs into 10 disease categories and calculated average scores. We then surveyed our IM residents' self-reported confidence and rheumatology educators' perceptions of IM resident proficiency in the 10 categories on a 10-point Likert scale. Finally, we tallied diagnoses in each category encountered by IM residents in rheumatology clinic. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated for the relationship between these data. The ITEs exposed 402 residents to 63 rheumatology-related educational objectives in the 10 categories; 24 objectives were categorized as ""other."" Survey respondents included 38 residents and 22 educators. There was no correlation between ITE scores in the 10 categories and resident confidence (r = - 0.226, p = 0.530), educator perception (r = - 0.274, p = 0.445), or diagnoses encountered (r = - 0.310, p = 0.383). There was a strong positive correlation between resident confidence and educator perception (r = 0.934, p < 0.001). ITE performance was low in crystalline arthritis and osteoarthritis despite high resident confidence, educator perception, and number of diagnoses seen. Our analysis of IM resident ITE performance identified curricular gaps not apparent in surveys of learner and educator perceptions or an assessment of learner experience. Key Points • In this study, we demonstrate how a systematic analysis of internal medicine resident performance on the in-training exam can identify important curricular gaps in rheumatology education that are not apparent in assessments of learners and educator perceptions or learner experience in rheumatology clinic. • In-training exam performance was low in crystalline arthritis and osteoarthritis despite high resident confidence, educator perception of proficiency, and number of diagnoses seen in these categories. • When rheumatology curricula for internal medicine residents are developed solely on the basis of learner and educator perceptions, common disorders traditionally considered ""easy"" may be overlooked.",Graduate medical education; In-training examination; Needs assessment; Rheumatology education.,David L Leverenz;Amanda M Eudy;Lisa G Criscione-Schreiber

These activities form the core of internal medicine: They are integral to the role of internal medicine as an academic and patient care discipline, and they complement the activities of the internal medicine subspecialties.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7917765/,[The nature of internal medicine],"We investigate here the problem of the nature of Internal Medicine in the context of the different medical disciplines. After reviewing the origins of Internal Medicine and the changes it has undergone since the early 19th century, we deal with the present crisis of this medical branch and the reasons for it. In Italy, the crisis of Internal Medicine began at the dawn of this century when Neurology became a distinct discipline, isolated from the rest of Clinical Medicine. The present-day crisis is determined by the fact that the different constituent parts of Special Medical Pathology have become autonomous specialist disciplines: this situation has convinced some specialists that Internal Medicine, as a single branch, no longer exists. We thus examine the ""justification"" for the existence of Internal Medicine. Specialist disciplines were originally created to permit deeper analysis of pathological phenomena; however, the great emphasis on detailed and precise analysis of the different phenomena has paved the way for immense progress in pathophysiology and diagnosis, while the synthetic approach fundamental to Clinical Medicine has been neglected. After referring to Claude Bernard's idea that an organism is greater than the sum of its parts, we note that nowadays considerable importance is given to the ""whole"", that is, to the global study of very complex systems. We thus examine the thesis of Internal Medicine (which views the organism as a whole) as the specific clinical tool enabling the physician to evaluate each single pathophysiological phenomenon.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,G Federspil;C Scandellari

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16649402/,[Fundamentals of internal medicine],"The most important diagnostic tools of the internist are the patient history and physical examination, after which a plan must be made for further diagnostic evaluation and treatment. For this the internist uses clinical reasoning based on his or her knowledge of evidence-based medicine and pathobiology. Pathobiology is primarily concerned with the question of how something works; evidence-based medicine is concerned with whether something works, and if so, how often or how much on average. Diseases do not exist in their own right and diagnostic criteria are based on consensus. A diagnosis of a 'disease' is based on our observation of patients as well as our opinions, whether right or wrong, regarding its cause. It is important to distinguish between 'partial causes' and a 'causative complement'. As a result of this concept, the biological relevance of a partial cause in the development of a disease cannot be derived from the strength of the link between it and the disease. Our opinions regarding the cause of disease appear to be based on induction. However, induction is not a good foundation from which to determine causation. Hypotheses on the cause of disease cannot be proved. They can, however, be disproved. Education, training, research and patient care all depend on effective communication. Communication is enhanced if the thesis is given first and thereafter the arguments. Hence, transfer of patient information such as during a morning report should begin with a working diagnosis (the 'thesis') and thereafter the findings of patient history, et cetera (the 'arguments'). At this time, too little attention is given to these branches of clinical reasoning and communication in education and continuing education in internal medicine.",,C D A Stehouwer

The main scientific platform on which the bequeathors assembled in the first few decades after World War II was the Algemene Ziektekundige Vereniging ('General Medical Association'), which met in Utrecht. Important medical steps forward in that period were the virtually complete eradication of tuberculosis in the Netherlands, the developing of vaccines against smallpox and polio, but also against the various types of virus hepatitis, and the progress in intensive care, transplantation and molecular biology. The Nederlandsche Internisten Vereeniging ('Dutch Association of Internists') has had its own scientific journal since 1958. Essentials in modern internal medicine are appropriate care and demonstrated usefulness of a treatment (evidence-based medicine); standards, values and ethics are core issues, as are quality control and cost control.

He graduated medicine in 1929 and worked at local university in prewar Vilnius. During World War Two, arrested by the Soviets and exiled to Siberian work camps he managed to return to Poland with Kosciuszko Division of Polish Army. Then, he continued to serve as a military and university medical doctor in Cracow and Lodz, finally to take over position of director of Internal Diseases Department in 1951 in Bialystok, holding an office of rector magnificus of Medical University of Bialystok from 1959 to 1962. Chlebowski trained generations of internal medicine specialists, who later became eminent representatives of emerging branches of internal medicine as distinct subspecialties in the field of cardiology, endocrinology and gastroenterology in Bialystok. In course of anti-Semitic campaign during March Events in 1968, he was disposed from the post of director of the university hospital department. Constantly harassed, he immigrated with the family to Israel to die in public traffic accident in 1969. Jakub Frydman, who survived not only hunger of food, but also metaphorical ""hunger of humanity"" during World War Two, turned out to be as good and useful as daily bread for Polish community after wartime. He was so devoted in this action, that he even changed his surname into Chlebowski (Polish: Chleb=English: Bread). In this way, due to similar experience and experience-shaped mentality, Chlebowski could be counted among medical authorities of the time, the individuals with such a high moral standard as Janusz Korczak (1878 or 1879-1942) or Julian Kramsztyk (1851-1926).",Bialystok; March 1968; Vilnius; internal diseases; medical training.,Andrzej Wincewicz;Piotr Woltanowski;Stanisław Sulkowski;Jolanta Małyszko

Nonetheless, the United States lacks an adequate physician workforce with mastery in caring for older persons and with expertise in building knowledge about how best to provide this care. This supplement aims to strengthen the physician workforce by fostering incremental and sustained improvements in the training of internal medicine residents in the care of older adults and in the development of geriatrics-oriented general internal medicine faculty. It identifies 3 major barriers to these improvements: lack of adequately trained teachers and mentors, the belief that explicit training in geriatrics has little to offer the generalist, and inadequate funding. Three strategies offer particular promise in overcoming these barriers: engaging directors of internal medicine residency programs, funding centers to promote collaboration between teaching and research programs in general internal medicine and geriatrics, and providing substantial incremental funding on the national level to pay for the time required to care for frail older patients and to teach and do research about this care. The barriers and strategies identified in this supplement may also inform efforts to enhance the skills of practicing physicians and improve training and faculty development in family medicine and other disciplines.",,C Seth Landefeld;Christopher M Callahan;Nancy Woolard

Apprenticeship experiences with clinical faculty are increasingly important in most medical schools and residency programs. This trend threatens to separate clinical education from the scientific foundations of medical practice. Paradoxically, this devaluation of biomedical science is occurring as the ability to use new discoveries to rationalize clinical decision making is rapidly expanding. Understanding the scientific foundations of medical practice and the ability to apply them in the care of patients separates the physician from other health care professionals. The de-emphasis of biomedical science in medical education poses particular dangers for the future of internal medicine as the satisfaction derived from the application of science to the solving of a clinical problem has been a central attraction of the specialty. Internists should be engaged in the ongoing discussions of medical education reform and provide a strong voice in support of rigorous scientific training for the profession.",,Eric P Brass

The authors describe a pilot program, Hospital to Home, at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry's internal medicine residency program, which uses home visits as an educational tool in geriatrics training. The program was begun in July 2001, and 23 residents have participated. Home visits expose residents in their first-year geriatrics rotation to the elements and outcomes of discharge planning and create a heightened awareness of the needs of older persons recently discharged from the hospital. The home visits are videotaped, and the residents present a videoconference based on the visits, which are attended by internal medicine residents, family medicine residents, and medical students.

A critical look at the inpatient encounter,"Etiquette-based communication may improve the inpatient experience but is not universally practiced. We sought to determine the extent to which internal medicine interns practice behaviors that characterize etiquette-based medicine. Trained observers evaluated the use of 5 key communication strategies by internal medicine interns during inpatient clinical encounters: introducing one's self, explaining one's role in the patient's care, touching the patient, asking open-ended questions, and sitting down with the patient. Participants at 1 site then completed a survey estimating how frequently they performed each of the observed behaviors. A convenience sample of 29 interns was observed on a total of 732 patient encounters. Overall, interns introduced themselves 40% of the time and explained their role 37% of the time. Interns touched patients on 65% of visits, asked open-ended questions on 75% of visits, and sat down with patients during 9% of visits.

The task force believes that the chaos and dysfunction that characterize today's medical care, and the challenges facing general internal medicine, should spur innovation. These are our recommendations: while remaining true to its core values and competencies, general internal medicine should stay both broad and deep-ranging from uncomplicated primary care to continuous care of patients with multiple, complex, chronic diseases. Postgraduate and continuing education should develop mastery. Wherever they practice, general internists should be able to lead teams and be responsible for the care their teams give, embrace changes in information systems, and aim to provide most of the care their patients require. Current financing of physician services, especially fee-for-service, must be changed to recognize the value of services performed outside the traditional face-to-face visit and give practitioners incentives to improve quality and efficiency, and provide comprehensive, ongoing care. General internal medicine residency training should be reformed to provide both broad and deep medical knowledge, as well as mastery of informatics, management, and team leadership. General internal medicine residents should have options to tailor their final 1 to 2 years to fit their practice goals, often earning a certificate of added qualification (CAQ) in special generalist fields.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11352700/,General internal medicine at the crossroads of prosperity and despair: caring for patients with chronic diseases in an aging society,"During the past quarter century, general internal medicine has emerged as a vital discipline. In the realm of patient care, it is the integrating discipline par excellence. Ironically, as general internists face the challenge of integrating advances of dizzying speed and complexity, and as their clinical practice becomes increasingly effective, it has become much more difficult for them to earn a living. General internists find themselves at the crossroads of prosperity and despair. Although general medicine research leads the research agenda in many departments of medicine, it is particularly vulnerable. The necessary multidisciplinary ""programmatic"" infrastructure is expensive, and results often take many years to obtain, particularly in the study of chronic disease. The educational environment in many institutions is particularly difficult for general medicine, both because the current emphasis on technical skills obscures patients' and learners' real needs and because complex patients on general medicine services are now so ill and their turnover so rapid. General internal medicine and geriatrics are synergistic, especially in today's marketplace. A focus on geriatric medicine could help general medicine continue to flourish. General internists are ideally suited to the integrated care of elderly patients with multiple problems, research opportunities are enormous in the geriatric population, and the teaching of geriatrics requires a high level of generalist skills. Problems that plague current generalist practice have unique significance to older patients. Organizations that represent general internists would do well to join forces with many other advocacy groups, especially those representing the interests of elderly patients and geriatric medicine.",,E B Larson

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9599199/,Internal medicine in the current health care environment: a need for reaffirmation,"Managed care has substantially changed the environment of health care delivery for general internists and internist-subspecialists. In the current system, one may wonder whether detailed and thoughtful workups still have a role when the direction of medical practice increasingly prizes a high volume of brief encounters. However, the very forces that drive managed care make the role of internist in the care of adults even more central. The internist's unique training and clinical approach should lead to both medically effective and cost-effective health care for adults. This type of health care will be increasingly important as the U.S. population ages and an increasing number of Americans have chronic, multisystem disease. Over the past century, internal medicine has evolved from a consultative model to a discipline that encompasses total adult care, from prevention to diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic illness and from outpatient care in the office to inpatient care in the intensive care unit. However, the leadership role of internists in the medical care of adults is now being threatened by family medicine and by fragmentation within internal medicine itself. Managed care organizations and the general public must be shown why internists are better able than family physicians to meet the health care needs of adults. Furthermore, as the marketplace becomes more competitive, the issue of when care given by a subspecialist is superior to that given by an internist has become more prominent. The rapidly developing ""hospitalist"" movement also threatens the traditional role of the internist as the caregiver for adults in health and disease. Given the historic flexibility of internal medicine and the assumption that appropriate roles can be defined for family physicians, subspecialists, and hospitalists, internists will continue to play a central role in providing the best care for adults in the new world of health care delivery.",,J P Nolan

Future departments of medicine will be compelled to respond to a projected shortage of physicians through augmented training strategies. The clinical programs will be more decentralized and responsive to patient preferences while demonstrating greater value. Departments will create adaptable, accountable structures in which clinicians working in interdisciplinary teams continuously improve processes and outcomes of care, and clinician and patient satisfaction. The restructuring of health care will afford exciting opportunities to align clinical and scholarly activities. The growing ability to link biological and clinical phenotypic information will lead to more effective and efficient clinical care. In view of the funding constraints and the remarkable opportunities for high-impact research, departmental research programs will become increasingly disciplined. Successful research programs will require durable investments in faculty career development, enabling infrastructure, interdisciplinary research teams, and diverse funding sources. The educational programs will demonstrate proficiency of trainees in the 6 current core competencies, as well as in additional areas critical to health care transformation. To improve organizational effectiveness, departments will create more nimble organizational structures led by individuals with diverse backgrounds.

Academic departments of geriatrics have been created in nations that have already experienced this shift. As an alternative strategy that builds on traditional strengths of academic medicine in the United States, departments of internal medicine should lead a multidepartmental, pan-institutional response to the aging imperative. Recognition of gerontology and geriatric medicine as central to the missions of internal medicine in clinical care, education, and research must be increased. In the process, academic departments of internal medicine will develop a high level of geriatric expertise and will launch many programs that address this challenge. Successful development of geriatric programs will serve as a catalyst to strengthen the integration among and between generalists and subspecialists. This will entail developing optimal sites and systems of geriatric care--at different levels of care and over time--that can enhance the geriatric education of medical students, residents, fellows, and practicing physicians. The study of aging and geriatric health care will also become an integral part of departmental research, in its subspecialty divisions as well as its divisions of general internal medicine and geriatrics.

According to the archive material from the first session of the Scientific Teaching Council of the Faculty of Medicine (17.03.1947), Mr Mario Krmpotic (Professor of Internal Medicine) was proposed as the first Director of the Internal Clinic (1947). For reasons unknown, Mr Krmpotic never came to Skopje to accept the post. As a consequence of this fact, the real founder of the CIM was the Russian Professor Alexandar Ignjatovski (1875-1955). Mr Ignjatovski was elected as the first Director of the Clinic for Internal Medicine in 1948 for a period of 4 years (1948-1952). At the same time, he was the first Chief of the CIM in Skopje (Macedonia). Dr D. Arsov was elected as the first Assistant Professor of Medicine in 1947, and second (and last) Director of the Clinic for Internal Medicine (1952-1974). For the same period (22 years) he was Head of the CIM. Dr D. Arsov sequentially and successively became first associated and then ordinary professor of medicine in the years 1951 and 1958.

Society of General Internal Medicine/Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine,"Dramatic changes in health care have stimulated reform of undergraduate medical education. In an effort to improve the teaching of generalist competencies and encourage learning in the outpatient setting, the Society of General Internal Medicine joined with the Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine in a federally sponsored initiative to develop a new curriculum for the internal medicine core clerkship. Using a broad-based advisory committee and working closely with key stakeholders (especially clerkship directors), the project collaborators helped forge a new national consensus on the learning agenda for the clerkship (a prioritized set of basic generalist competencies) and on the proportion of time that should be devoted to outpatient care (at least one third of the clerkship). From this consensus emerged a new curricular model that served as the basis for production of a curriculum guide and faculty resource package. The guide features the prioritized set of basic generalist competencies and specifies the requisite knowledge, skills, and attitudes/values needed to master them, as well as a list of suggested training problems. It also includes recommended training experiences, schedules, and approaches to faculty development, precepting, and student evaluation. Demand for the guide has been strong and led to production of a second edition, which includes additional materials, an electronic version, and a pocket guide for students and faculty. A follow-up survey of clerkship directors administered soon after completion of the first edition revealed widespread use of the curricular guide but also important barriers to full implementation of the new curriculum. Although this collaborative effort appears to have initiated clerkship reform, long-term success will require an enhanced educational infrastructure to support teaching in the outpatient setting.",,A H Goroll;G Morrison;E B Bass;R Jablonover;D Blackman;R Platt;A Whelan;F P Hekelman

Competing demands during this transitional phase cause confusion for students and educators. In 2014, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) released 13 Core Entrustable Professional Activities for Entering Residency (CEPAERs). A committee comprising members of the Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine and the Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine applied these principles to preparing students for internal medicine residencies. The authors propose a curricular framework based on five CEPAERs that were felt to be most relevant to residency preparation, informed by prior stakeholder surveys. The critical areas outlined include entering orders, forming and answering clinical questions, conducting patient care handovers, collaborating interprofessionally, and recognizing patients requiring urgent care and initiating that care. For each CEPAER, the authors offer suggestions about instruction and assessment of competency. The fourth year of medical school can be rewarding for students, while adequately preparing them to begin residency, by addressing important elements defined in the core entrustable activities. Thus prepared, new residents can function safely and competently in supervised postgraduate settings.",clinical skills assessment; medical education; medical education curriculum development/assessment; medical education—assessment; medical education—mentoring; medical education—undergraduate.,D Michael Elnicki;Meenakshy K Aiyer;Maria L Cannarozzi;Alexander Carbo;Paul R Chelminski;Shobhina G Chheda;Saumil M Chudgar;Heather E Harrell;L Chad Hood;Michelle Horn;Karnjit Johl;Gregory C Kane;Diana B McNeill;Marty D Muntz;Anne G Pereira;Emily Stewart;Heather Tarantino;T Robert Vu

Evaluation of resident ""trustworthiness"" in performing entrustable professional activities (EPAs) may offer a more tangible assessment construct than evaluations based on expectations of usual progression toward competence. However, translating results from EPA-based evaluations into ACGME milestone progress reports has proven to be challenging because the constructs that underlay these two systems differ.The authors describe a process to bridge the gap between rotation-specific EPA-based evaluations and ACGME milestone reporting. Developed at the University of Washington in 2012 and 2013, this method involves mapping EPA-based evaluation responses to ""milestone elements,"" the narrative descriptions within the columns of each of the 22 internal medicine subcompetencies. As faculty members complete EPA-based evaluations, the mapped milestone elements are automatically marked as ""confirmed."" Programs can maintain a database that tallies the number of times each milestone element is confirmed for a resident; these data can be used to produce graphical displays of resident progress along the internal medicine milestones.Using this count of milestone elements allows programs to bridge the gap between faculty assessments of residents based on rotation-specific observed activities and semiannual ACGME reports based on the internal medicine milestones.

More recently, also considered important is training on the broader issues of health care delivery and public policy, especially since the environment of medicine is changing rapidly. With limited curricular time these issues must compete with the traditional and important clinical training. To evaluate how these subjects have been included in internal medicine training, the Resident Physicians Section (RPS) of the American Society of Internal Medicine (ASIM) sponsored a survey of United States internal medicine chief residents which was conducted by the Internal Medicine Center to Advance Research and Education (IMCARE). The objectives of the study were to 1) study the extent of training on health care delivery and public policy issues offered to residents by internal medicine residency programs; 2) assess training opportunities now available; and 3) determine areas of study not fulfilling perceived needs. The questionnaire contained 12 questions. Chief residents rated the 1) quality of their program in preparing residents on health care delivery, public policy issues and practice management; 2) level of instruction provided on 12 topics; and 3) degree of priority these same topics should have. Respondents were asked to identify 1) any other relevant areas their residency program covered particularly well; 2) the amount of time which should be devoted to these socioeconomic topics in each year of training; and 3) the most appealing formats for learning about these topics. Despite the rapidly growing influence of socioeconomic issues on medical practice, many chief residents perceive that important topics are not being addressed adequately.

He was appointed Director of the Clinic of Medicine and Head of the Chair of Internal Medicine, who served at those positions in the period 1952-74. In 1958 he was elected Professor of Internal Medicine. The first habilitation of the Medical Faculty in Skopje was defended by D. Arsov in 1954, titled: ""The Effects of the Intravenous Epinephrine on the Hypersplenism of Malaria and Cala-Azar"". On August 18, 1967, D. Arsov was elected Full Member and also the first member in the field of medicine of the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts. The excellent experience in the work with the patients, precise observation of the symptoms and syndromes of the diseases in each patient, knowing the most advanced therapy at that time enabled D. Arsov to make conclusion for possibility of new therapy and gave him the material for writing scientific papers. In the first half of the 50s, during his regular work, Arsov discovers a new, internationally recognized therapy for rheumatism. Patients of both Cala-Azar and inflammatory rheumatism were treated with small doses of adrenaline therapy and they felt drastic decrease in rheumatism inflammation within one week. This therapy was used a couple of years in several countries around the world. He participated in the undergraduate and graduate studies. He contributed to the development of 2,240 graduated doctors and under his management over 300 doctors specialized in internal medicine and became specialists internists. Under his management, numerous habilitations and dissertations in internal medicine were finished. He contributed also to the development of 25 assistants, 5 docents, 5 full-time professors in internal medicine at the Medical Faculty in Skopje. He has published more than 200 papers from different areas of internal medicine, of which 36 are on the PubMed. He has published 5 books on internal medicine for students and doctors. He was a President and member of several Macedonian medical associations, as well as of medical associations of former Yugoslavia. He was awarded with the highest awards of former Yugoslavia and Macedonia. He was also awarded with international awards, such as: Doctor Honoris Causa by the University in Besancon and Honor and Medal from the City Assembly of Besancon (France). During his management of the Internal clinic the University Internal clinic developed eight different sub-specialist departments: Cardiology, Pneumology, Rheumatology, Nephrology, Hematology, Gastroenterology and Endocrinology with metabolism and Clinical biochemical laboratory. The fast development of subspecialties has led to development of separate clinics for each subspecialty in 1975, so only the Chair of Internal Medicine remained as a connection between the subspecialties for education and scientific research. He was a prolific scientist who after World War II wrote the first scientific and specialist papers and books in the field of internal medicine in Macedonia. He created a school of internal medicine. The scientific and uncompromised attitude towards the expert truth are weaved in the unforgettable face of the Academician Prof. D-r. Dimitar Arsov, scientist, teacher, and doctor.

The aim of this three-step survey is to study the motivational factors for students and trainees in internal medicine to choose for rheumatology as a future career option and the idea among experienced rheumatologists about the needs for changes in the training program. An online survey was distributed among students in medical training (in the final 3 years) and trainees in internal medicine from the Ghent University and University Hospital. Questions concerned the level of clinical exposure to rheumatology and the motivation about becoming rheumatologist. Next, experienced rheumatologists were asked about the needs to change the current training. Descriptive data are shown and chi-squared tests were calculated to assess differences between groups (based on gender and exposure). Logistic regression was performed to study associations between demographic variables and choosing rheumatology as career. Only a minority of students (17%) and about half of trainees (45%) were ever exposed to rheumatology. Only 11% of students and 17% of trainees considered becoming rheumatologist. There was no difference in choice based on gender but previous exposure seemed to play an important role, and especially during the pre-specialty years. Univariate logistic regression identified the year of training and exposure as predictors for choosing rheumatology. Multivariate analysis only retained exposure as significantly associated (odds ratio (95% CI) = 2.88 (1.51-12.58)).

The specialty of internal medicine is very concerned about the mandatory hand-off because it threatens the internist's identity as the physician who can care for the sickest patients in any venue, making it harder for patients and health plans to distinguish the internist from family physicians and nurse practitioners. The hospitalist movement has much to offer internal medicine. To enjoy the benefits and avoid the harms associated with the hospitalist model, internal medicine must resist the imposition of the mandatory hand-off and use the hospitalist's focus on excellent inpatient care to improve the practice of medicine by all internists.",,H C Sox

The aim of this study was to test what realistic skill targets could be achieved in FCU, with a relatively short training (theoretical and practical) of 9 h offered to Internal Medicine certification board attending students, and if the addition of further 9 h of training could significantly improve the level of competence. Kappa statistic was used to calculate the inter-observer agreement (trainees/tutor). The agreement between the trainees (who completed the entire training) and the tutor was, respectively, ""substantial"" (k = 0.71) for the identification of pericardial effusion, ""moderate"" (k = 0.56-0.54) for the identification of marked right ventricular and left ventricular enlargement, ""substantial"" (k = 0.77) for the assessment of global cardiac systolic function by visual inspection and ""fair"" (k = 0.35) for the assessment of size and respiratory change in the diameter of the inferior cave vein (IVC). 18 h training in FCU provided proficiency in obtaining adequate images from the parasternal window without providing the ability to correctly master the apical and subcostal windows. As concerns the interpretative skills, only pericardial effusion and visual estimation of global systolic function could be correctly identified, while ventricular enlargement and IVC prove to be more difficult to evaluate. This study supports incorporating FCU into Internal Medicine fellowship training programs, and should facilitate the design of other similar training courses.",,Chiara Mozzini;Ulisse Garbin;Anna Maria Fratta Pasini;Luciano Cominacini
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24420579/,Interprofessional simulation training improves knowledge and teamwork in nursing and medical students during internal medicine clerkship,"Simulation is effective at improving healthcare students' knowledge and communication. Despite increasingly interprofessional approaches to medicine, most studies demonstrate these effects in isolation. We enhanced an existing internal medicine curriculum with immersive interprofessional simulations. For ten months, third-year medical students and senior nursing students were recruited for four, 1-hour simulations. Scenarios included myocardial infarction, pancreatitis/hyperkalemia, upper gastrointestinal bleed, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. After each scenario, experts in medicine, nursing, simulation, and adult learning facilitated a debriefing. Study measures included pre- and post-tests assessing self-efficacy, communication skills, and understanding of each profession's role. Seventy-two medical students and 30 nursing students participated. Self-efficacy communication scores improved for both (medicine, 18.9 ± 3.3 pretest vs 23.7 ± 3.7 post-test; nursing, 19.6 ± 2.7 pretest vs 24.5 ± 2.5 post-test). Both groups showed improvement in ""confidence to correct another healthcare provider in a collaborative manner"" (Δ = .97 medicine, Δ = 1.2 nursing). Medical students showed the most improvement in ""confidence to close the loop in patient care"" (Δ = .93). Nursing students showed the most improvement in ""confidence to figure out roles"" (Δ = 1.1). This study supports the hypothesis that interdisciplinary simulation improves each discipline's self-efficacy communication skills and understanding of each profession's role. Despite many barriers to interprofessional simulation, this model is being sustained.",,Nancy M Tofil;Jason L Morris;Dawn Taylor Peterson;Penni Watts;Chad Epps;Kathy F Harrington;Kevin Leon;Caleb Pierce;Marjorie Lee White
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3070029/,The rheumatology knowledge and skills of trainees in internal medicine and family practice,"Our study examines the rheumatology knowledge and skills of trainees in internal medicine and family practice residency programs. Site visits were made to 15 programs in the eastern half of the United States. Eighty-one trainees participated in the study, 53 in internal medicine and 28 in family practice. Each completed a 50-item rheumatology quiz and performed a clinical assessment of a trained patient evaluator. Trainees in internal medicine had quiz and clinical assessment scores of 52.4% and 72.9%, respectively, while scores for family practice trainees were 43.4% and 61.6% (p less than 0.004 for both). Regression analysis showed that having had a rheumatology elective had a significant effect on knowledge and skills. Trainees in family practice programs were 3 times less likely than internal medicine trainees to have taken a rheumatology elective. Family practice trainee scores in our study were comparable to scores previously documented in 4th year medical students. These results confirm the importance of a specific rheumatology experience for the development of rheumatology knowledge and skills in internal medicine and family practice trainees, and suggest that the rheumatology content of these training programs needs to be enhanced.",,R F Meenan;D L Goldenberg;S H Allaire;J J Anderson
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10627973/,[Internal medicine in academic centers: what future?],"The rapid increase in medical knowledge and the introduction of new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques has also led to increasing specialisation in the field of internal medicine. For this reason controversy has arisen, particularly in university centres, about the importance and role of ""general"" internal medicine compared to the medical specialties. In this paper the most important tasks of internal medicine in patient care, in graduate and postgraduate training and in clinical research are analysed. The prime task of internal medicine is comprehensive care for the increasing number of elderly patients with multiple co-existing diseases. In this respect generalists cannot be adequately replaced by specialists. Mutual critical co-operation between internists and specialists also reduces the risk of overuse of medical technology and leads to a corresponding reduction in hospital costs. In medical schools internists have a major task in teaching bedside clinical examination and a general approach in the diagnosis and treatment of the most relevant medical disorders, while specialised knowledge becomes more important during the postgraduate training period. Hospital-based internal medicine remains an essential basis for clinical training not only for general internists and family physicians but also for all medical sub-specialties. In continuous medical education internists have the task of synthesising and transmitting new knowledge from the various special fields, including their application in a non-selected broad patient population. Also in clinical research several tasks remain for internists, such as clinical epidemiology, cost-benefit analysis and critical evidence-based assessment of diagnostic and therapeutic methods. Discontinuance or drastic reduction of internal medicine in university centres would not be justified and could lead to a negative balance between general internists and specialists, with negative consequences for health care, as experienced in the USA. Instead of fragmentation and rivalry for positions and resources, better co-ordination and co-operation between internists and specialists is needed in university centres, if possible in integrated medical departments.",,F Follath

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9110490/,[Evolution of internal medicine and its specialties in the last decades: an outward view],"The development of the subspecialties of internal medicine in the western world is reviewed from a historical perspective, focusing on the case of the United States of America. During the last decades, changes both in society and in medicine as a whole have prompted a great dispersion of medical practice styles, not always well-defined in their contents and goals, and ranging from primary care to ultra specialization. The definition of the general internist and of the subspecialist together with the attributes of each category according to an American College of Physicians task force group are commented upon. Some of the possible reasons accounting for a decreased interest in general internal medicine during the eighties together with figures supporting a recent reversal of this trend are given. New proposals have originated in government as well as in medical circles to promote the development of general internists, conceived as physicians knowledgeable in the classic subspecialties but also skilled in clinical epidemiology, informatics, behavior medicine, decision-making, clinical economics, ethics, and problem solving. The American College of Physicians, on the other hand, considers that allowing the community-based general internists to disappear, strengthening the generalist's identity as a primary care-oriented physician who provides no subspecially care, becoming hospital-based generalists who act mainly as consultants, or becoming fully trained subspecialists who also provide primary care, are all rejectable options. These arguments illustrate the fact that even in highly developed societies a degree of indefinition remains as to the best balance between general internal medicine and its subspecialties.",,E Rosselot

The residents saw a mean of 7 patients per week in clinic (standard deviation +/- 2) and received an average of 2 patient calls daily (standard deviation +/- 2). The mean number of patient calls received each night on-call was 3 (standard deviation +/- 6) and on weekend call days, an average of 4 patient calls were received (standard deviation +/- 8). Internal medicine residents reported spending an average of 7 minutes per call talking to the patient (standard deviation +/- 5) and 8 minutes in follow-up activities (standard deviation +/- 6).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9110491/,[Organizational structure of internal medicine in Chile],"Internal Medicine, as a comprehensive discipline, has become increasingly dismembered during the last decades due to several reasons, some of which are the growing complexities of its practice, its obstinate confinement to hospital-based practice, its generation of and subsequent disfunction from general internal medicine and the medical subspecialities. In Chile internal medicine is currently organized in three levels of patient care, each of anarchical and distortioned proportions. These levels do not constitute a fluent network of progressive patient care but rather an heterogeneous combination of ironclad compartments in search of their own autonomy. A few of the many problems and challenges that internal medicine faces in Chile are: (a) in primary care medicine, problem-solving abilities must be improved and programmed care must be privileged over free choice. Specialist in general medicine must be assigned to primary care and multiprofessional teams must be strengthened; (b) Secondary care is underdeveloped due to the waning prestige of internal medicine and waxing attractiveness of its subspecialities. Programmed formation of specialist in internal medicine has been so far rigorous and demanding, but excessive in number in relation to available post. This leads trained internist to practice as subspecialist, without having the adequate conditions for such a practice. To avoid this situation, the scope of internal medicine emergency wards, integral medicine clinics, and medical student teaching should be handed over to it; (c) Tertiary care is a task of subspecialist. It is not known how many subspecialist are required, or how many physicians are currently practicing as a subspecialist. Most of the currently practicing subspecialist are self-qualified or have received quick training through short rotations by not always well-qualified centers. Many are only former internal medicine residents. In this setting, it is not possible to devise a prospective plan of subespecialty training. To make internal medicine in Chile efficient and timely, its is necessary to restore and restructure a rational patient care network that will do away with the current red tape and waiting list as well as to allow the insertion of well-trained specialist in the corresponding levels of patient care.",,E Parrochia
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1983937/,The leadership crisis in internal medicine: what can be done?,"During the 1990s, internal medicine will change. Whether that change will be in directions desired by internists will depend on whether effective leadership of the discipline is accepted by the academic department chairs. Individually, and as a group, they are the only ones with sufficient authority to take control and initiate and sustain needed change. The time frame for action is short and diminishing. Opportunities still exist for effective leadership to present the discipline as more attractive to students by demonstrating that they can play an important role in helping to solve problems in health care. Unmet societal needs underlie much of the public's disaffection with the profession, and the chairpersons must begin to solve those needs. Today's practice environment is ever less appealing with increasing regulation and intrusive third-party actions. These stresses will increase until internists understand from research the value of what they do in practice and learn to choose what is effective in outcome and cost. Practice models integrating the skills and talents of internists, as these are focused on the needs of patients, are experiments that can be started in academic departments.

Therefore, we carried out a 2-round Internet Delphi study. Fifty-nine items were assessed on a 5-point scale; an item was considered important if ≥ 80% of the respondents awarded it a score of 4 or 5. In total, 26 registrars and 30 consultants in internal medicine completed both rounds of the study. Overall, they considered it essential to include information about 11 items in the MR. Subgroup analyses revealed that the registrars considered 8 additional items essential, whereas the consultants considered 1 additional item essential to record. Study findings can be used as a starting point to develop a structured section of the MR for therapeutic information for both paper and electronic MRs. This section should contain at least 11 items considered essential by registrars and clinical consultants in internal medicine.",Delphi study; internal medicine; medical records; pharmacotherapy.,Robert J van Unen;Jelle Tichelaar;Prabath W B Nanayakkara;Michiel A van Agtmael;Milan C Richir;Theo P G M de Vries

If, however, we look to the future, this image has the potential to be viewed in a significantly improved light, provided the internist modifies his role and position within the health service structure and maintains his characteristic broad-minded approach to medical problems. He may play his essential role in patient management by utilizing his capacity to ""fit together"" diagnostic options, advice from specialists, and therapeutic choices--in short by acting as ""case manager"" and offering expert support to both individual patients and to the overall organizational setup of the clinical structure. Another important task of the internist is to train students and oversee continuing education of the medical community. The position of clinical and patient manager is particularly relevant to future health care scenarios that will be characterized by economic constraints, the need for new organizational models, populations on the move, and the necessity to involve patients directly in health-related decision making and to respect their opinions. To meet this challenge, the future internist must enhance his global approach to medical problems with specific training in management in order to offer multi-sector expert support to the health care structure.",,A Borghetti;G Marcon

This reflection recognizes the specificities of general internal medicine: the first contact, the longitudinal follow-up, the comprehensive approach and the coordination with other medical participants. The need for subspecialists would be reduced and the need for primary comprehensive care physicians would be increased. The development of a performent sector of general internal medicine is able to respond to the demand of the patients and also of the general family practitioners. This model has positive impacts for the whole hospital community. We are all weary of discussions of state medicine, of the high cost of medical care, of the adequacy of medical care for the indigent, of the shortage of hospital beds for those who can pay, of the shortage of nurses, and so on. But these are, in part our problems; if their solution is to be to our liking, we must be active in them. The spector of state medicine is continually raised before us. Greater participation, by the federal, state and local governments in matters of health seems inevitable although most of us think it is important to retain in some manner or other the principle of private enterprise.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18766425/,Greater focus on clinical rheumatology is required for training in internal medicine,"Early intervention for rheumatic disease has been shown to improve prognosis, but is dependent on the recognition of pertinent symptoms and signs. This study was undertaken to identify the attitudes of junior doctors toward musculoskeletal assessment. The charts of 100 randomly selected medical patients admitted via the Emergency Department were reviewed for documentation of the musculoskeletal system. In addition, junior doctors were interviewed regarding their views on musculoskeletal assessment. Only 16% of medical admission notes contained a reference to the musculoskeletal system and the recording of joint examinations was incomplete in all cases. Prior training in musculoskeletal assessment depended on the joint area involved (hand, 100%; foot, 36.2%). Most doctors felt competent in hand assessment (68.8%) but only 12.5% could examine the foot. More than one third could not confidently diagnose common rheumatic conditions, while 75% felt unable to diagnose a connective tissue disorder. The majority (88.7%) regarded the musculoskeletal assessment as difficult/challenging and 61.3% thought that it should not be included as part of a general medical examination. However, 80% of doctors felt that they had not received adequate teaching in musculoskeletal assessment and would welcome further training. The omission of the musculoskeletal assessment for medical patients admitted to hospital is reflected in the fact that doctors lack training in this area. Furthermore, doctors lack confidence in their ability to recognise both common and rare rheumatic diagnoses, a problem likely to impact adversely on the outcome of patients with these conditions.",,Eoghan M McCarthy;Barry J Sheane;Gaye Cunnane

Paediatrics, dermatology, laryngology, and neurology had established themselves as independent specialties and the unity of internal medicine had disintegrated in the 19th century. On the basis of Nothnagel's complications (First Department of Medicine) and Schrötter's treatment of tuberculosis in sanatoria (Third Department of Medicine), the 19th century continued to exert an influence on medicine until well into the first decade of the 20th century. Neusser furthered haematology and endocrinology and laid the foundations for the Central Roentgen Institute. Before the main task of neurological research became the concern of psychiatry, Frankl-Hochwart conducted research in the fields of neurology and neuro-endocrinology.

Nevertheless, the research work of his assistant Eppinger made a major contribution to electrocardiography in the first decade of our century.

Logistic regression models were used to identify significant predictors of the primary care specialty choices made by the 1991 and 1992 graduates of U.S. medical schools. These predictors were debt itself; other financial indicators; certain medical school characteristics; certain practice location plans; certain demographic factors; aspects of academic performance; and students' predisposition to a primary care specialty. Data for this study were gathered from a variety of sources at the Association of American Medical Colleges and from the Health Education Assistance Loans program. Both direct and indirect effects of debt were identified under specific conditions. The study revealed complex relationships between debt and the other predictors identified. For example, debt operated in relation to the levels of the graduates' expected incomes; debt from subsidized loan sources was significant for women who chose general internal medicine; debt was important in choices of family practice; and debt by itself was significant for those planning to practice in the West and who chose general internal medicine. Also, seemingly opposing effects of debt occurred. For example, in the family practice model used in this study, the threshold effect of debt was positive, while the linear effect of debt above the threshold was negative. Such vriations help explain the conflicting findings of some past research. These and other findings prompt the authors to state that when investigating the effects of debt, it is not fruitful to ask what the effect of the debt is on all three primary care fields as a group. It is more appropriate to ask several questions, such as: under what conditions does debt influence specialty plans? Among which groups of students does debt have an impact on specialty plans? Are all of the primary care specialties similarly affected by the issues surrounding debt? Does the effect of debt change over time? The authors conclude by indicating possible policy implications of their findings.",,W L Colquitt;M C Zeh;C D Killian;J M Cultice

Furthermore, between 1933 and 1945, many excellent scientists and clinicians were forced to emigrate from Germany and Austria to the US because of persecution by the Nazis for political or ""racial"" reasons. After the end of World War II, scientific and technical leadership of American Internal Medicine remained unchallenged; today many European physicians complete their training in the biomedical sciences in the United States. Beginning in the 1980s, German-speaking internists increasingly publish the results of their research in American scientific journals.",,A Schulte-Bockholt;A Bauer

The scope of seven of these is general internal medicine, and the other seven are intended exclusively for rheumatic problems. The majority of these systems are prototypes. To date, none of them is widely used by physicians. Preliminary evaluation studies and/or independent reviews have been reported for all of the systems. The need for further evaluation studies is recognized, and strategies to carry these out are outlined. Furthermore, the potential usefulness for patient care and education is discussed.

It is an essential educational step that forces the learners to reflect upon the thought processes that underlie their actions. Debriefing encourages a personal and collective reflection in order to remodel erroneous mental schemas and rectify actions done in context. Debriefing cannot be improvised; it requires a sound structure and regular practice in order to be truly effective. The debriefer must be considerate, choose appropriate learning objectives and dedicate ample time to the learners. Debriefing is focused on learning acquired in context-in other words, on the actions that were performed within a real-life or simulated clinical practice situation-and immediately follows the situation. After an initial phase of emotional release, the debriefer will help learners analyse their actions to identify their underlying rationale (contextualization), extract the overarching principles related to the lived situation in order to modify the rationale if needed (decontextualization) and assist the transfer of learning to real life (in the case of simulation) and to similar situations (recontextualization). A final summary of learning achieved during the training session concludes the debriefing. Debriefing is useful in any learning situation, including in internal medicine. Even if simulation is still underused in internal medicine, post-event debriefing can be implanted in our clinical services. Indeed, training our students and shaping them into healthcare professionals rest in no small part on hospital rotations where the intern is confronted with real-patient situations that are suitable to learning. Some in-hospital clinical encounters can be actively transformed into learning opportunities thanks to post-event debriefing, but can also passively morph into bad daily practice if no supporting action is implemented. Debriefing can thus provide an opportunity to develop non-technical skills in critical situations, or doctor-patient communication skills, within a team or between colleagues. These competencies are the hallmark of well-trained interns and are indispensable for the proper functioning of a care team. We will not develop the emotional and psychological management of debriefing in this article. We hope we will helpfully introduce as many of our colleagues as possible to the art of debriefing in most circumstances.",Debriefing; Débriefing; Débriefing post-événement; Internal medicine; Medical education; Médecine interne; Post-event debriefing; Pédagogie; Simulation en santé; Simulation-based education.,J Galland;M Jaffrelot;S Sanges;J P Fournier;J Jouquan;G Chiniara;É Rivière

Need for a resolution,"Decreased availability of internal medicine residents for inpatient care may result from efforts to contain rising health costs and to decrease funding for graduate medical education. The movement toward increased ambulatory training, reduced work hours for residents, and the declining interest in internal medicine careers will further decrease resident numbers. Hospitals have relied on trainees for an extraordinary range of hospital services, resulting in long duty weeks, assumption of large amounts of ancillary responsibilities, excessive patient loads, and increased house staff stress. Residents must be relieved of time-consuming, nonmedical chores and internal medicine training must be redefined to provide experiences which are important to gain competence. Hospitals must find other resources for providing patient care functions not educationally valid for residents, to allow that training to refocus on the appropriate development of the internist of the future.",,E Z Wallace

Our hypotheses were that senior residents are more likely than interns to request an ethics consultation; and providing or forgoing life-sustaining treatment would outrank other situations for requesting a consult. After two mailings, 46 out of 65 residents completed the survey (71% response rate). Statistical methods included Fisher's exact test for categorical variables, and general linear models to compare means between groups. A majority of residents stated that instruction on ethics was received through lectures and rounds. They were most likely to request an ethics consult for issues concerning medical futility and disagreement resolution. Comparing residents by yearof training for reason for ethics consultation, senior residents were more likely to request a consult for questions about artificial nutrition and hydration (p = 0.06). There was no difference between residents with or without previous exposure to ethics consultation or formal instruction in ethics and the likelihood of requesting a consultation in the future.

It is shown that just early internal medicine teaching provided the principles that were stated by M. Ya. Mudrov and that subsequently formed the basis of a course taught at the Department of Faculty Clinic. The original teaching of a theoretical course without a clinic one at the Department of Particular Pathology and Therapy, which was stipulated by the 1835 Charter, gradually lost its importance as clinical teaching was formed. The succession of the Clinical Institute and the Faculty Clinic was also shown in the staff the director of the newly-opened Clinic and Therapy Department Professor was A. I. Over, M. Ya.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28653946/,The truth on current peritoneal dialysis: state of the art,"The share of peritoneal dialysis (PD) in the spectrum of chronic dialysis has decreased markedly in the Netherlands in the last 15 years. Consequently, the knowledge of nephrologists and nursing staff on PD has declined leading to a negative spiral in which loss of experience resulted in loss of enthusiasm to offer PD to patients and also in less interest in the new PD developments. All these changes took place while the results of PD improved and patient survival was at least similar to that on haemodialysis. The aim of this review is first to give a summary of the principles and practice of patient and staff education and to describe the role of the medical contribution in decision-making. On this basis, the second aim is to update internist-nephrologists on a number of issues that have been underexposed in the past. Recent patient and technique survival data of PD patients is reviewed, and also the new insights into dialysis adequacy. The presence of residual renal function is the main determinant of patient survival together with prevention of overhydration. Urea and creatinine removal are not important at all when patients are still passing urine. Many early problems with PD are due to the peritoneal catheter and suggestions are made for improvement of its function. The prevention and management of infections is reviewed, and also the regular assessment of peritoneal function.

Graduates of primary care tracks are more likely to choose careers in general internal medicine than are other internal medicine graduates. Primary care internist training has been accompanied by the growth of academic general internal medicine divisions and by the enhancement of the scientific base for ambulatory care practice and medical education. Expanded ambulatory training opportunities, modeled after current primary care tracks, should be offered to all residents in internal medicine. At the same time, primary care tracks should be revised to address deficiencies in current ambulatory training. These tracks should be designed to commit most resident time to ambulatory care settings, to involve residents in community-based and interdisciplinary health care, and to expose residents to conditions outside of the medical sector that affect health.

Among the many factors inducing this change are: negative experiences in internal medicine training in medical school; lower compensation for cognitive versus procedural services; the shift of care from hospital to ambulatory settings inducing a decreased intensity of exposure; and the stringency and stress of internal medicine residencies. Various measures to address this problem are outlined.,,M Forland
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2519475/,[Concept and scope of internal medicine],"Internal medicine derived from the study of internal pathology. The division of knowledge originated subspecialties. These may be grouped according to the organs or systems of interest (cardiology, gastroenterology, etc), to pathogenic mechanisms (clinical immunology, infectious diseases, etc), to characteristics of the patients (intensive medicine, geriatrics, etc). Some are mainly devoted to diagnostic or therapeutic procedures (radiology, nuclear medicine, clinical pharmacology, etc). Internal medicine may be thought of as another specialty or as a trunk from which other subspecialties are derived and nurtured. Internal medicine is characterized by its concern for ample clinical syndromes, multisystemic diseases, general diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and the intensity of the patient-physician relationship. An analysis of the relationship between internal medicine and its subspecialties must consider the patient's viewpoint, medical teaching, postgraduate training, research and organization of medical departments and societies. A revival of the identity of internal medicine is definitely needed.",,H Pumarino Carte

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9110494/,[Training in internal medicine and its specialties: universities' proposals],"Medical School graduates can enter a medicine subspecialty training program upon completion of a 3 year Internal Medicine residency. The Ministry of Health has contributed to postgraduate training by defining the type of physician the country needs, and by financial support of specially (Internal Medicine) training. Before 1995, when applicants began being charged a fee, finding for subspecialty training was provided exclusively by the universities. Currently, 450 training post are available for 550 graduates from all medical schools. Of these, 59 are in Internal Medicine and 58 in its subspecialties. A quantitative analysis of 40 years of training programs in Internal Medicine by the traditional medical schools shows that only the Catholic University of Chile Medical School privileges subspecially training whereas all other schools favor general Internal Medicine training. A high number of Internal Medicine trainees never take final examination. Nevertheless, training through practice, not necessarily in a university setting, accounts for 67% of Autonomous National Corporation for Certification of Medical Specialties. CONACEM accredited subspecialists. About 63% of those who finish an Internal Medicine training program decide to go into subspecialization. It is felt that subspecialization involves technical as well as non-professional aspects, such as a philosophical stance towards the search for truth through research and creativity. An integral education in a subspecialty can only be given by the university. Non-university centers, however, can contribute to subspecialization by allowing trainees to gain access to newer technology or to larger numbers of patients. A critical question is how many subspecialists should exist in relation to the number of generalists and according to the country's health requirements. In my personal view, the proportion of subspecialists is excessive. The decision to subspecialize should not be exclusively a personal choice, but should take into account the interests of all other participants in the process of subspecialization. Therefore, a definition must be reached as to the number and type of subspecialty training programs offered in the country. These programs should be made more flexible, to allow for a shortened specialty training, which in turn depends from the type of pregraduate training delivered. Some of the problems requiring an urgent solution in the specialization process are: 1) finding should be shared in some proportion by all those who will benefit from the subspecialist's action, including private hospitals and HMOS; 2) There should be a clear-cut central health policy, that will be respected by the decentralized State Health Services, with fulfillment of the teaching agreements, respect for the assigned clinical fields, and for the accredited teaching capacity; 3) Unauthorized or ""parallel"" training must be stopped and the role of scientific societies or of State Health Services must be clarified, 4) The institutional involvement of a number of academicians must be reinforced.",,C Norero

Groups of students with little or no senior clerkship experience before their internal medicine clerkship were compared with groups of students who had extensive clerkship experience in disciplines other than medicine. Groups were compared with respect to ward-performance scores and scores on identical multiple-choice examinations. Neither ward-performance nor multiple-choice scores revealed differences attributable to previous clerkship experience.

Group analysis was performed based on the type of residency track leading to board eligibility: (1) traditional internship plus 3 years of internal medicine residency; (2) traditional internship plus 2 years of internal medicine residency and 1 year of subspecialty training; (3) specialty track internship plus 2 years of internal medicine residency; and (4) traditional internship plus 3 years of allopathic internal medicine residency. Subgroup analysis of the subspecialty track group was performed to determine if any particular subspecialty-trained subgroup performed better than the others. Results indicate that all groups had similar scores and pass rates except for the allopathic-trained residents, whose scores and pass rates were lower.

Curriculum change will mandate that we define the roles of general internists and subspecialists in the delivery of primary care and that we re-define how we train these two groups of internists. We must focus attention on the issue of service compared with education and must confront the issue of how best to train foreign medical graduates. Any curriculum change will also have to accommodate residents selecting careers in research in order to ensure an adequate supply of physician-scientists.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20816587/,Why management and leadership education for internists?,"Around the world, there is an increasing need for more efficiency in healthcare alongside cost containment. Internal medicine physicians are in a pivotal position in this regard. In many countries, they act as bridges between ambulatory/continuity of care systems and hospital-based intensive care and sophisticated therapies. Within the medical field, they often bridge gaps between many specialities increasingly required to provide modern medical care. These skills of managing complex environments, being sensitive to health economics and using large amounts of information, are not normally taught or developed in programmes of internal medicine. While some skills are natural and acquired through practice, other skills would benefit from insights from the fields of management. On the other hand, it seems critical to have internists playing a leading role in the future care of aging populations, and they are the most likely to understand the needs of these multi-pathology cases. On a practical level, internists face the daily challenges of engaging and leading as many people as possible to provide the best care; this requires very good leadership, negotiation, team-working and change-management skills, all of which can be vastly enhanced with specific education initiatives that are targeted and customised to physicians' needs. Management education for internists should be ""spiral"", starting from medical school and expanding to incorporate issues as the physician matures into new activities and responsibilities. In practical terms, current internists and residents of internal medicine can be brought into contact with such education by a combination of workshops as well as residential and online courses.",,Henrique M G Martins

Although equally divided between children and adults, the patient population had two large bulges, infants less than 2 years old and young adults aged 18-39 years. Most of the 833 patients (from 406 households) who returned the questionnaires were well educated and professional. They indicated they were aware of the nature of the practice; had been looking for a specialist, not a ""doctor for the family""; and were highly satisfied.

We conducted a randomized pilot study to determine if an educational session could influence internal medicine (IM) residents' interest in oncology and their ability to accurately determine the prognosis of cancer patients. We randomized 29 IM residents to attend either a traditional American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) oncology review lecture focusing on cancer complications or a lecture reviewing landmark studies that are the basis of common cancer treatments and prognoses. On the post-lecture questionnaire, residents' interest in oncology and their overall performance on knowledge assessments were similar. However, more residents attending the traditional ABIM lecture inappropriately withdrew care for patients with potentially treatable conditions. Prognostication is an important skill for IM residents, and inaccurate negative biases could potentially lead to serious errors in clinical judgment.

Further, the critical evaluation of clinical practices of subspecialists is greatly needed and is far more likely to be accomplished effectively within departments of internal medicine than in categorical disease centers.

In the past twenty years, with the increasing subspecialization within internal medicine and the development of advances in technology, the role of the general internist seems to be endangered. Recently much attention has been focused on this area and Divisions and Programs of General Internal Medicine have been established in most medical schools in the USA. The University of Buenos Aires instituted a Program of General Internal Medicine in its major teaching hospital in 1987. One of its purposes was to offer an educational experience to residents in the field of internal medicine primary care. This paper summarizes how this program was carried out and the subjects proposed in the area of Diagnosis and Treatment. The Program of General Internal Medicine is performed in the Outpatient Division and it is staffed by 3 faculty members and 4 fellows. Residents in Internal Medicine have a three month, full-time block rotation in the Program. A young, city dwelling, lower middle class population participates in the Program, with almost 10000 visits a year. The Program offers an experience that includes supervised patient care, an average of 100 office visits a month, and seminars and/or workshops covering topics of ""Diagnosis and Treatment"", ""Case Presentations"", ""Clinical Epidemiology"", ""Prevention"", and ""Doctor-Patient Interview"".

Its intellectual fundament originates from nineteenth century medicine in Germany. Traditionally, these German physicians covered the entire field of medicine. However, due to lack of therapeutic remedies their main emphasis was on diagnosis and prognosis. During the last sixty years the tremendous increase in medical knowledge has led to a strong tendency towards organ specialization. The generalists in hospitals have met competition from general practitioners and specialists in geriatrics. At the same time their domain has steadily shrunk as the number of medical hospital beds has been reduced. Although not to the advantage of the patients, progress is wiping out the hospital generalists. Most (90%) hospital doctors are now organ specialists, although the majority of patients admitted to medical departments have diseases in more than one organ system. Therefore, generalists should be at least as equally appreciated as the organ specialists. To save the generalists the educational system must be changed. The two types of specialists should follow their own educational paths qualifying to separate and independent competence areas (general or organ-specific). Medical departments should be encouraged to maintain general sections in addition to the organ-specific sections. The generalist and the organ specialist should be professionally united in their efforts to develop internal medicine as a discipline.",,P F Hjort;G Stene-Larsen

The current non-medicolegal autopsy rate is less than 5% of hospital deaths. This study compares internal medicine and pathology resident physician perceptions of the autopsy, including the importance, procurement, technique, and the pathologist-internist interaction. An 84-item survey based on autopsy literature was designed, piloted, and distributed to 214 residents at a single 800+ bed tertiary care academic teaching hospital (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston) to accomplish this goal. Completed surveys were obtained from 72% of medicine (n = 118) and 84% of pathology (n = 42) residents. Residents strongly agree on the importance of autopsies for education, answering clinical questions, public health, and research. Autopsy rates are deemed inadequate. Internists are comfortable requesting autopsies, but report insufficient guidance and difficulty with answering technical questions. Although not requested on all hospital deaths, internists are more likely to initiate an autopsy request than a decedent's family, and worry significantly less about institutional costs and malpractice litigation than pathologists believe. Internists expressed interest in having an instructional brochure to give families, observing an autopsy, and having increased communication and support with autopsies from pathology residents. The main reasons why autopsy consent is not requested (it is unpleasant, cause of death is known, family is upset or seems unwilling) and why families refuse (patient has suffered enough, body may be handled disrespectfully, religious/moral objections, lack information) were similar for both resident groups. Despite their decline, autopsies still remain important to medicine as indicated by internal medicine and pathology residents at a large academic center.

Specific objectives were defined within each line: results to be achieved, methodology according to action plan. After several years of collegial work in this initiative, very positive results have been achieved. We conclude that the Strategic Plan has been useful to better define the position of our specialty and to state which tools such as those mentioned are effective to cope with the new challenges that may occur in other groups.",,M Bernabeu-Wittel;S García Morillo;M Ollero;J Hernández-Quero;M A González de la Puente;M Montero Pérez-Barquero;F Díez;J García-Alegría;E Pujol;C Sanromán;J A Cuello;in representation of Sociedad Andaluza de Medicina Interna (SADEMI)

Those which are increasing their experiences seem to be doing it out of necessity rather than educational efficacy. The existence of ambulatory experiences outside of internal medicine does not seem to be a factor in whether internal medicine departments have or are increasing their ambulatory experiences. Of the programs which do exist most have a goal of broad exposure to ambulatory patient problems; very few have special educational interventions to support or complement student's patient care. The existing programs overwhelmingly occur in school clinics rather than private clinics, and most suffer some serious logistic problems. The most frequently cited problem was lack of faculty time for teaching. It appears that in most cases students have been fitted into existing clinics or patterns of teaching, with insufficient effort given to achieving the maximal educational benefit for the student. Teaching students, particularly at the junior clerk level, requires committed faculty time, which is clearly a commodity in short supply.

Because the amount of money available for health care training is decreasing, these questions also have national importance. Primary care internal medicine, not synonymous with general internal medicine, offers distinct advantages to patients over family practice adult care and primary care offered by internist subspecialists. The University of Nevada has a singular opportunity to organize a strong primary care internal medicine residency, but national problems of internal medicine emphasis exist. Nationwide changes in internal medicine residency programs (ongoing) and American Board of Internal Medicine nationalization of the fledgling primary care internal medicine fellowship movement are suggested. Specifically proposed is an extra year for primary care training with a single examination after four years, producing general internists with a primary care ""minor."" Alternately, and ideally, there would be a full two-year primary care fellowship with a separate internal medicine primary care subspecialty board examination. Either of the above options would provide necessary training and academic credibility for primary care internists, and would redirect internal medicine certification and training.",,K J Kurtz

To general internists, his name is linked to Kussmaul's sign and Kussmaul breathing, and to gastroenterologists, he is in many ways-through the development of the gastric pump and the first gastroscope-the father of modern gastroenterology. His reputation as an excellent teacher, his compassion for his patients, and his ability as a clinician scientist led him to be regarded as a giant of 19th century medicine.

The average postgraduate seniority among the selected applicants was 8.4 years, varying from three to 17 years. The successful applicants had between 19 and 100 months appointment in the specialty and had published between one and 86 articles and were currently, or had been, previously employed in a teaching department. No significant differences in the frequencies of appointment were found between men and women. A statistical model is established and this shows that the odds ratio for teaching appointments increases with a factor 110 for the group of applicants with 15 og more published works compared with the group with two or fewer published articles. Three factors in particular in the group of applicants concerned were decisive for selection: number of articles, postgraduate seniority and place of appointment at the time of application. Increasing postgraduate seniority in the specialty of more than four to five years did not per se increase the chances of obtaining a teaching appointment.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/861884/,Patterns of practice in internal medicine in Ontario,"To determine the feasibility of wholly referral practice in internal medicine within a prepaid health service, the practice profiles of 694 internists in metropolitan, nonmetropolitan urban, and rural areas of Ontario were delineated by analysis of data from questionnaires and health-insurance billing. The questionnaire showed that two thirds of internists, chiefly younger practitioners, confined themselves to a referral consultant practice; the other one third included primary care. Subspecialists practised predominantly in metropolitan areas; most general internists in such areas provided primary care, whereas most general internists elsewhere had an entirely referral practice. This pattern of practice is greatly different from that in the United States but probably similar to that in other provinces in Canada. Extension of wholly referral practice to all internists in Ontario appears feasible, provided the numbers entering residency training are controlled. The present Ontario curricula for internal medicine and its subspecialties appear suitable for such a pattern of practice.",,J K McConnon;C P Shah
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8543247/,[A national qualifying internal medicine examination for Israeli medical students],"In 1991 the deans of the 4 medical schools in Israel decided to institute a national qualifying examination in internal medicine. This marked the beginning of the process of unifying the qualifying examinations in all major medical fields. We describe the development of the examination, experience with its administration to 720 students in 1992-1994, and the outcome of this initial effort. The examinations were prepared by a committee of senior faculty from the 4 schools, representing all the relevant clinical areas. Professional consultation was provided by the Unit for Medical Education of Tel Aviv University. Each examination consisted of 180 multiple choice items, reflecting an agreed representation of the various medical specialties, and was designed to test both comprehension and problem-solving ability. A syllabus was published by the committee and distributed to students and faculty in preparation for the examination. In composing the examination, the committee took into consideration differences in general policy and varying emphases in the curricula of the 4 schools. Analysis of the results of the 3 annual examinations showed both a high level of reliability and high quality of the majority of the individual test items. There was a trend with time to slightly lower average scores, and fewer passed the exam last year. There was improvement in the results after the first 2 years in the area of problem-solving related to interpretation of imaging, blood smears and clinical photographs, but this trend did not continue into 1994. The introduction of a high level examination based on a common syllabus provided important feedback, improving both student motivation and clinical teaching. For all schools, the outcome of the examination served as an important external indicator of teaching standards. Following this positive experience, uniform examinations in surgical subjects and pediatrics were introduced for the first time in 1993. The committee recommends that Israeli medical schools gradually introduce a comprehensive qualifying examination based on a mutually agreed list of objectives and syllabus.",,N Notzer;O Shalev;M Alkan;U Levinski;A Rubin;R Melamed

(b) Partial credit algorithm 1 (PS(50)): One point for 100% true answers; 0.5 points for 50% or more true answers; zero points for less than 50% true answers. No point deduction for wrong choices. (c) Partial credit algorithm 2 (PS(1/m)): A fraction of one point depending on the total number of true answers was given for each correct answer identified. No point deduction for wrong choices. Application of partial crediting resulted in psychometric results superior to dichotomous scoring (DS). Algorithms examined resulted in similar psychometric data with PS(50) only slightly exceeding PS(1/m) in higher coefficients of reliability.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2914063/,Teaching medical students in ambulatory settings in departments of internal medicine,"Clinical training in ambulatory settings is an increasingly prominent topic in medical education, but most descriptions of internal medicine programs in the literature concern training for residents. The authors undertook a survey of departments of internal medicine to obtain and assess information about requirements for ambulatory clinical experiences for medical students. The results show that few departments (24% of the 101 departments responding) required ambulatory care experiences for undergraduates. Most of the required programs had a goal of broad exposure to ambulatory-patient problems; almost none had special educational interventions to complement students' care of patients. The experiences that were incorporated into the clerkship in a single block of time were more favorably rated than the experiences that occurred intermittently throughout the clerkship. Inability to provide continuity-of-care experience was an important concern of the departments. Most programs had logistical problems, the most serious and frequently cited being the lack of faculty time for teaching. The authors raise concerns about the educational effectiveness of many existing programs and, given the problems with faculty involvement, about the long-term viability of these programs.",,J Feltovich;T A Mast;N G Soler

Educators use the term behavioural objectives to represent educational objectives stated as behaviours that must be accomplished by the students. Educational objectives represent an important part of the curriculum content. However, curriculum content, as defined in large academic departments, has often been described as irrelevant for practitioners outside these large centres. Behavioural objectives drawn for the year of internal medicine, the fourth year of a five-year specialty programme in anaesthesia, were evaluated for their clinical relevance for anaesthetists in clinical practice outside cities where teaching programmes are found in the province of Québec. A questionnaire based on 288 objectives, using a rating scale, was used to compare the opinions of the members of the Education Committee (6) and outside practitioners (24). There were no significant differences between the mean ratings of the two groups of raters on ten of the 14 groups of objectives. A concordance of opinion was also present when there was disagreement with the importance of certain objectives. There was disagreement with only one group (VIII) of objectives on 14. Within this group there was agreement with the clinically oriented objectives and disagreement with the laboratory oriented objectives. Objectives that were related to the acute aspects of illness were rated higher than those related to their chronic aspects.

In the first study, a psychometric common-item equating technique was used to compare the performance of 1980 recertification candidates with that of 1979 certification candidates. Results showed that the knowledge base of practicing internists was similar to that of residents completing training. The second study analyzed the performance of 1980 recertification candidates to determine whether being certified or having an interest in a subspecialty affects a physician's performance on items in that area. The results showed that subspecialists do significantly better than general internists on items pertaining to their area of specialization. Similar outcomes were found for internists with a special interest in a subspecialty area. These findings establish the importance of continued periodic evaluation and support the development of an evaluation tool tailored to the physician's area of concentration.",,J J Norcini;R S Lipner;J A Benson Jr;G D Webster

This is also true for resident physicians. Objections such as a discontinuity in care and the decline in the quality of education frequently prevent resident physicians from working part-time. Over the past two years, the University Medical Centre Nijmegen, the Netherlands, has experimented with job-sharing on clinical wards for resident physicians in internal medicine.

There is no documentation that allocation of resources results in improved quality. In Denmark we have recently focused on the quality of cancer treatment and have allocated resources without any evidence that it will improve survival, whereas less attention has been paid to less prestigious diseases. Length of stay can be an indicator of quality, as we operate with an efficient work process as a goal. But it is not a goal by itself, as only when coupled with cure or improvement in the disease can it be worth aiming at. We therefore compared the length of stay in Danish Departments of Internal Medicine to look for differences or similarities.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8034861/,Task Force 4: The relationship between cardiovascular specialists and generalists,"1. An imbalance between generalists and cardiovascular subspecialists exists that will require decades to correct. We question the validity of the 50:50 generalist/specialist ratio in view of current practice patterns for cardiology. 2. There has been a large increase in the number of cardiovascular specialists in the past 30 years that will continue if training programs remain at their current size. 3. Cardiovascular specialists provide a substantial amount of inpatient care, care to older patients and care to those with cardiovascular symptoms, although generalists actually provide the majority of office-based cardiovascular care. 4. A significant portion of cardiovascular specialist care can be classified as comprehensive care to patients with and without cardiovascular disease. 5. Most generalists and cardiovascular specialists do not perceive a need for additional cardiovascular specialists. 6. Many providers perform cardiovascular procedures at levels below the recommended threshold for maintenance of clinical competence. 7. Managed care may result in a reduced demand for cardiovascular specialists. 8. If cardiovascular specialists provide general care, it may not be assumed that previous training prepares them for generalist practice. 9. The appropriate boundaries of cardiovascular care between generalists and cardiovascular specialists are indistinct. They are defined somewhat by the training programs from which the generalists graduate. 10. Many generalists have deficiencies in basic skills in clinical cardiology. 11. Desirable interactions between generalists and cardiovascular specialists involve referral of patients in both directions to the provider who can give care to a given patient, at a given time, with the best outcome and lowest cost.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,S Goldstein;T A Pearson;J M Colwill;D P Faxon;R H Fletcher;D S Moodie
