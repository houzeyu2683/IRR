https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30064451/,Top orthopedic sports medicine procedures,"Orthopedic sports medicine is a subspecialty of Orthopedics that focuses on managing pathological conditions of the musculoskeletal system arising from sports practice. When dealing with athletes, timing is the most difficult issue to face. Typically, athletes aim to return to play as soon as possible and at the pre-injury level. This means that management should be optimized to combine the need for prompt return to sport and to the biologic healing time of the musculo-skeletal. This poses a great challenge to sport medicine surgeons, who need to follow with attention to the latest scientific evidence to offer their patients the best available treatment options.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 524 (70.05%) of 748 assistants who receive specialization training in Turkey were reached. There were 20 multiple choice questions ( 1 mark each) and 3 questions (more than 1 mark each) in the survey consisting of twenty-three questions. Our study group was formed by doctors who have still worked as assistant in our country and have accepted to participate in the study. The doctors who finished assistantship with any reason and did assistantship for time less than 6 months and did not exactly fill the questionnaire form were excluded from the study. RESULTS 524 (71.97%) of 728 assistant who are in 40 (100%) of 40 provinces where assistant training given in Turkey were reached. 474 (90.45%) participants were satisfied to do orthopedic specialization. When considering working hours, it was observed that 337 (64.31%) participants had over 90 hours weekly including night shift and 521 (99.42%) participants had to work after night shift. The majority of participants (361 persons 68.89%) were receiving salaries between TL 4000-6000. When looking at the entire working group, the rate of participants who said that scientific training is weak or there is no scientific training was 427 (81.48%). CONCLUSIONS Our survey study is one of the first statistical study which investigating professional and social problems of orthopedic assistants. Some of important problems as training satisfaction, abuse by patients and/or manager, the average monthly income and psychological status assessment is emphasized.

They are widely used in artificial joints, as bone replacement material and as resorbable material. Also (recombinant) bone morphogenetic proteins are used. Classification of biomaterials is based on composition (animal or human tissue, metals, polymers, ceramics or composites) or on biological reactions after implantation (bio-inert, bio-tolerant or bio-active). Depending on location and function biomaterials have to meet requirements with respect to durability (artificial joints), fixation (total hip prosthesis), flexibility (artificial ligaments), solubility (suture wire) and stiffness (plates and screws).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3885608/,[The history of orthopedics in Freiburg],"During the 19th century orthopedic medicine in Germany developed uniformly. The starting point was almost always the foundation of a private institute, which was then taken over by state/communal or confessional/charitable bodies, and in some cases universities. In Freiburg, however, orthopedics developed very differently. From the very beginning it was a clinical and academic discipline within the university. Orthopedic medicine was practised systematically at Freiburg Surgical Clinic from about 1835 on, and it was at this time that the first lectures in Orthopedics were given. Freiburg also has one of the oldest university orthopedic institutes. The founding of an Extraordinary Chair of Orthopedic Medicine is due to the efforts of the pathologist Aschoff and the surgeon Kraske. Besides Carl Friedrich Hecker, the special development of orthopedics in Freiburg may be attributed to the work of Georg Friedrich Louis Stromeyer. It is to him that orthopedics--in Freiburg and elsewhere--owes a debt not only for introducing surgical procedures, but first and foremost for its establishment as a scientific discipline. The remarkably early rise of orthopedics in Freiburg was followed, after World War I, by a decline brought about by economic conditions and university policy. Its consequences were so far-reaching that the Chair of Orthopedic Medicine in Freiburg was not refounded until 1970- the last in Germany. Until that time orthopedics remained dependent on the judgment or indulgence of the directors of the surgical clinic, who regarded orthopedics as a conservative discipline, or at best as a branch of limb surgery.",,M Weber

Since then the meaning of the term has changed dramatically. Starting as the planned title of a guidebook for parents it developed to become the name of a new medical discipline. During the 19th century orthopaedic surgery was dominated by private institutions, which were a privilege of the wealthy. Orthopaedic surgery as we know it in Germany today developed mostly from the so called ""cripple asylums"" (Krüppelheime). Their main objective was the treatment of infections of bones and joints, scoliosis and of hereditary diseases. Many of these orthopaedic diseases lost their importance due to prophylaxis and early diagnosis. The great improvements in the living conditions led to a change regarding the age of the patients and the diseases treated. Until world war II mostly children were treated by orthopaedic surgeons. After world war II orthopaedic surgeons have adjusted to the demographic change and have increasingly been treating elder patients. The development and the spread of prostheses display the increasing importance of age related illnesses.",,M A Rauschmann;K D Thomann

The forces that have advanced outcome measurement to the forefront of health care include the shift in payers for health care from the patient to large insurance companies or government agencies, the movement toward assessing the care of populations not individuals, and the effort to find value (or cost-effective treatments) amid rising healthcare costs. No ideal method exists to measure outcomes, and the information gathered depends on the reason the outcome information is required. Outcome measures used in research are best able to answer research questions. The methods for assessing physician and hospital performance include process measures, patient-experience measures, structure measures, and measures used to assess the outcomes of treatment. The methods used to assess performance should be validated, be reliable, and reflect a patient's perception of the treatment results. The healthcare industry must measure outcomes to identify which treatments are most effective and provide the most benefit to patients.",,John E Kuhn

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12817917/,Orthopaedic surgery in the elderly,"The orthopaedic surgeon brings to the operating room some of the greatest challenges for the anaesthesiologist. Various factors, such as age, health status, disease process, type and extent of operative procedure, provide differing circumstances, which an anaesthesiologist is obliged to cope with. This contrasts to other surgical specialities in which patient factors and operative procedures are much more predictable. The number of older patients in orthopaedics is steadily growing, and the anaesthesiologist has to take all measures to permit an early and efficient rehabilitation, a concept which is now widely recognized for improving the success of orthopaedic surgical procedures. Factors which may hinder this concept are post-operative pain, central nervous system dysfunction, fatigue, deep sedation, delayed enteral feeding and absorption. There is no evidence that regional anaesthesia without the use of the continuous regional analgesic technique decreases morbidity and mortality as compared to general anaesthesia, in this context. However, the advantages of continuous analgesia through a perineural spinal or epidural catheter are promising and deserve further investigation. The concept of the optimal post-operative multimodal regimen needs to be defined. The application of NSAID and paracetamol is an integral part of this concept, and the dose of opioids should be titrated to the lowest efficient dose needed. Thus, this chapter discusses the different controversies and future trends of anaesthesia with regard to the elderly in orthopaedic surgery.",,Alain Borgeat;Georgios Ekatodramis

Importance in an increasingly operatively oriented faculty],"The foundation of the German Society for Orthopedics in 1901 was due to a separation from the faculty of surgery because a surgical approach alone did not adequately deal with the symptoms. Orthopedists were initially considered as a fringe group. The conservative treatment approach was initially at the forefront and operative measures were a side line. The main aim was the rehabilitation of patients into a normal life as best as possible. In the conservative area treatment with orthopedic technical aids and appliances rapidly came to play an important role and a great multitude of technical appliances were developed with sometimes very different possible applications. Despite the clearly improved operative treatment approaches in orthopedics and trauma surgery, technical orthopedics still plays a substantial role even today. Healing and supportive aids and appliances are of decisive importance for the treatment of a multitude of diseases and handicaps. They stabilize and improve operative treatment results and often result in new approaches. This depends on cooperation between technicians, therapists and physicians in a team, even in the scientific field. Evidence-based studies on the effectiveness of technical aids are currently still uncommon but recently some clear evidence for effectiveness could be shown. Scientifically this is a very varied field of work. The demographic development presents new requirements which must be dealt with.

Numerous reimbursement and systems approaches to controlling medical inflation and improving quality have failed to provide cost-effective, high-quality health care in most circumstances. Public and private payers are currently implementing pay for performance, a new reimbursement method linking physician pay to evidence of adherence to performance measures, to constrain costs, encourage efficiency, and maximize value for health care dollars. High-quality research regarding pay for performance and its impact is scarce, particularly in orthopaedic surgery. Although supporters argue pay for performance will remedy the fragmented, costly delivery of health services in the United States, skeptics raise concerns about disagreement over quality guidelines, financial implications for providers and hospitals, inadequate infrastructure, public reporting, system gaming, and physician support. Our survey of orthopaedic surgeons reveals limited understanding of pay for performance, marked skepticism of nonphysician stakeholders' intentions, and a strong desire for greater clinician involvement in shaping the pay for performance movement.

The case is made that orthopaedic training is more efficient with simulators that facilitate deliberate practice throughout resident training and more research should be focused on simulator validation and the refinement of skill definition.",,Geb W Thomas;Brian D Johns;J Lawrence Marsh;Donald D Anderson

Management of spasticity seeks to reduce its burden on patients and to limit secondary complications. Non-operative interventions including stretching/splinting, postural management, physical therapy/strengthening, anti-spasticity medications, and botulinum toxin injections may help patients with spasticity. Surgical management of these conditions, however, is often necessary to improve quality of life and prevent complications. Orthopaedic surgeons manage numerous sequelae of spasticity, including joint contractures, hip dislocations, scoliosis, and deformed extremities.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12838046/,Ethical guidelines for orthopaedists and industry,"During the past decade, there has been a gradual erosion of the ethical principles that guide relationships between physicians and industry. Two areas in which the decline has been most notable are gifts to physicians and the relationships of industry to educational and research activities. The gifts have become more valuable and industry representatives make gifts available under circumstances where frequently there is no educational program. Research support continues at a high level but researchers increasingly find themselves in positions that present conflicts of interest with the interests of patients who are research subjects. These changes have taken place during an era in which professionalism also has declined and physicians are losing control of their practices to government and to the corporate sector. A solution to this dilemma is suggested through strict adherence to the existing ethical principles by physicians and industry. Physicians must renew observance of professionalism and improve oversight and discipline. Medicine cannot impose restrictions on the pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries but can appeal to industry's leadership. Oversight and discipline also must govern marketing and sales representatives of industry. There must be an ethical common ground if a new physician and industry relationship is to succeed in producing a climate of mutual respect and higher ethics; patients will benefit and physicians and industry will regain the public trust.",,Charles H Epps Jr

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29046090/,Is the number of new trauma and orthopaedic consultant posts increasing or decreasing?,"Introduction Trauma and orthopaedics is a popular surgical specialty in the UK. Recent changes to the National Health Service have suggested an imbalance with fewer jobs yet more trainees. Furthermore, subspecialisation is emerging within all surgical disciplines. The aim of this study was to examine whether there were decreasing numbers of trauma and orthopaedic (T&O) consultant appointments in the UK, and to determine the frequency of subspecialisation. Methods All 51 issues of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) careers supplement from the year 2000 were reviewed as well as the 51 issues from 2010. The number of T&O posts, requested subspecialty interests and the number of posts in other surgical specialties were analysed. Results A total of 481 consultant posts in T&O were advertised in the 102 issues of the careers supplements reviewed. Of these, 281 were advertised in 2000 and 200 in 2010. The mean number of posts per issue was 5.5 in 2000 and 3.9 in 2010. In 2000 orthopaedic posts represented 30.5% of all surgical posts while in 2010 this was 37.8%. Under two-thirds (61.6%) of posts requested a specialty interest in 2000 but this increased to 93% in 2010. The greatest increase in named subspecialty was seen in 'spine' (from 4.1% to 19.0%.) while 'general' had the greatest decrease (from 38.4% to 7.0%). Conclusions UK consultant posts in T&O are decreasing in frequency. Most advertised posts request a subspecialty interest but registrar training focuses on producing 'generally' competent orthopaedic consultants. The onus is therefore on fellowships to develop subspecialty interest. As these are not all educationally approved, reconfiguration of fellowships is likely to be necessary.",Consultant; Jobs; UK.,S Wilson;Npm Jain;D S Johnson

Providing battlefield orthopaedic care poses special challenges; not only are many wounds unlike those encountered in civilian practice, but patients also must be triaged and treated in an austere and dangerous environment, undergo staged resuscitation and definitive surgery, and endure prolonged medical evacuation, often involving ground, helicopter, and fixed-wing transport across continents. Most orthopaedic wounds in Iraq are caused by exploding ordnance--frequently, improvised explosive devices, or IEDs. Because of advances in care, rapid medical evacuation, and modern body armor, many casualties have survived in Iraq who would not have done so in previous wars. Treatment of war wounds, many of which are devastating in the scope of soft-tissue and bony injury, requires a team approach using hypotensive resuscitation, damage-control orthopaedics, new or rediscovered techniques of hemostatic and intravenous hemorrhage control, vacuum-assisted wound closure, and advanced reconstruction.

The aim of this study was to compare the ""rotational"" (more than one surgeon) and ""full-time single surgeon"" use of the orthopedic theater. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively evaluated patients who underwent orthopedic surgery in 2016 in different theaters. A total of 604 of 1973 patients were excluded from the study, and 1369 patients were analyzed. The follow-up period was 1 year. While evaluating the cases, the duration and order of each case, the total operation time on the table, the number of surgeons, the total number of cases, the number of residents, and the experiences of the surgeons were investigated, and the effects of these parameters on the complication rates were analyzed. The Dindo-Clavien system was used to classify the complications. RESULTS When comparing the methods, the complication rate of the full-time single-surgeon method (12.9%) was less than that of the rotational method (21.7%) (p: 0.022). A higher rate of complications (8.5%) was observed in operations with a duration of 115 minutes or more compared to other operations (p <0.001). A higher complication rate (23.7%) was observed in cases lasting more than 345 minutes (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS According to our study, full-time use of the orthopedic theater by a single surgeon was found to be safer than rotational use.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28852361/,The Scarcity of Orthopaedic Physician Scientists,"Breakthrough advances in medicine almost uniformly result from the translation of new basic scientific knowledge into clinical practice, rather than from assessment, modification or refinement of current methods of diagnosis and treatment. However, as is intuitively understood, those most responsible for scientific conception and creation-scientists - are generally not the ones applying these advances at the patient's bedside or the operating room, and vice versa. Recognition of the scarcity of clinicians with a background that prepares them to develop new basic knowledge, and to critically evaluate the underlying scientific basis of methods of diagnosis and treatment, has led to initiatives including federally funded Physician-Scientist programs, whereby young, motivated scholars begin a rigorous training, which encompasses education and mentorship within both medical and scientific fields, culminating in the conferment of both MD and PhD degrees. Graduates have demonstrated success in integrating science into their academic medical careers. However, for unknown reasons, orthopaedic surgery, more than other specialties, has struggled to recruit and retain physician-scientists, who possess a skill set evermore rare in today's increasingly complicated medical and scientific landscape. While the reasons for this shortfall have yet to be completely elucidated, one thing is clear: If orthopaedics is to make significant advances in the diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal diseases and injuries, recruitment of the very best and brightest physician-scientists to orthopaedics must become a priority.

There is increasing pressure for medical technology assessment, which traditionally has involved evaluating safety and effectiveness, to also include consideration of cost effectiveness. We updated our database of orthopaedic cost-effectiveness studies, critically reviewed their methods, and examined trends over time. Current analyses have numerous shortcomings, such as the inclusion of relatively few studies, inconsistent methodologic approaches, and lack of transparency. The wide variation in cost-effectiveness ratios observed among current interventions suggests efficiency can be improved. Despite reimbursement authorities in many other countries formally considering cost-effectiveness when determining coverage of new technologies, Medicare has been resistant to considering costs of treatments.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32539590/,HipSim - hip fracture surgery simulation utilizing the Learning Curve-Cumulative Summation test (LC-CUSUM),"Background and purpose - Virtual reality simulation of hip fracture surgery is available for orthopedic residents nationwide in Denmark. Summative assessment of learning applying the learning curve cumulative summation test (LC-CUSUM) has not been utilized in orthopedic simulation training. The strength of the LC-CUSUM is that it assumes incompetency and signals competency based on solid statistics. We investigated the LC-CUSUM characteristics of novices stepwise mastering the simulated dynamic hip screw (DHS) procedure. Material and methods - 32 1st-year orthopedic residents participated in HipSim and its 3 subsequent LC-CUSUM evaluations: placing a Kirschner wire, placing a Kirschner wire in different patients, and performing the entire DHS procedure in different patients. The career status of the participants, i.e., still working in orthopedics or in another specialty was recorded ≥ 2 years after participation and associated with the simulation performance (passed/failed). Results - 13/14 participants passing HipSim according to LC-CUSUM were still working in orthopedics, while 9/18 participants failing HipSim had quit orthopedics at ≥ 2 years follow-up. The simulator-generated feedback did not statistically significantly differ between the groups. Interpretation - LC-CUSUM and its summative pass/fail assessment of each simulation was feasible in this formative simulation program. Clinical educators can be reassured that participants passing HipSim are likely to continue to 2nd-5th year of residency, while failing HipSim should raise concerns and trigger career counselling and clinical supervision. The motivational aspect of LC-CUSUM pass/fail assessment when designing formative simulation training warrants further research.",,Jan Duedal Rölfing;Rune Dall Jensen;Charlotte Paltved

In particular, fractures that lead to delayed union or even nonunion represent a serious clinical challenge for which few treatment options are available. The multiple surgical procedures often needed are associated with patient morbidity and reduced quality of life. Biotechnological advances have made possible a host of potential treatments for enhancing and accelerating the repair of bone. By stimulating the body's own healing mechanisms, clinical outcomes may be improved while also containing procedural costs. Biotherapeutics may take the form of proteins, genes or cells that can be used to treat the injury. Protein biotherapeutics have received the greatest attention. Using recombinant DNA techniques, growth factors that play important roles in bone development and repair are being produced. By delivering exogenous growth factors to the site of injury in an appropriate manner, bone formation can be stimulated. Although individual proteins have been the primary focus of investigation, combinations of biomolecules can have additive, and perhaps synergistic, effects. Alternatively, genes coding for osteotropic growth factors can be delivered to the site of injury. Expression of the gene effectively results in localised delivery of the growth factor. Delivery of cells having osteogenic potential can also result in bone formation. Furthermore, it may be possible to obtain additional benefits by combining biotherapeutic approaches, such as by introducing cells genetically modified to overexpress therapeutic proteins of interest. Although biotherapeutics have great potential for stimulating bone repair, only a limited number of treatments have been approved by governmental regulatory agencies for clinical use. Bone morphogenetic activity was initially described in 1965, but not until 2001 and 2002 did two protein biotherapeutics, utilising bone morphogenetic proteins 2 and 7, receive approval for commercial distribution.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24990985/,"Orthopaedic Surgery Under National Health Reform: An Analysis of Power, Process, Adaptation, and Leadership: AOA Critical Issues","Morrison argued that demography, economy, and technology drive the evolution of industries from a formative first-generation state (""First Curve"") to a radically different way of doing things (""Second Curve"") that is marked by new skills, strategies, and partners. The current health-reform movement in the United States reflects these three key evolutionary trends: surging medical needs of an aging population, dramatic expansion of Medicare spending, and care delivery systems optimized through powerful information technology. Successful transition from a formative first-generation state (First Curve) to a radically different way of doing things (Second Curve) will require new skills, strategies, and partners. In a new world that is value-driven, community-centric (versus hospital-centric), and prevention-focused, orthopaedic surgeons and health-care administrators must form new alliances to reduce the cost of care and improve durable outcomes for musculoskeletal problems. The greatest barrier to success in the Second Curve stems not from lack of empirical support for integrated models of care, but rather from resistance by those who would execute them. Porter's five forces of competitive strategy and the behavioral analysis of change provide insights into the predictable forms of resistance that undermine clinical and economic success in the new environment of care. This paper analyzes the components that will differentiate orthopaedic care provision for the Second Curve. It also provides recommendations for future-focused orthopaedic surgery and health-care administrative leaders to consider as they design newly adaptive, mutually reinforcing, and economically viable musculoskeletal care processes that drive the level of orthopaedic care that our nation deserves-at a cost that it can afford.",,Charles D Callahan;Daniel Adair;Kevin J Bozic;Blaine T Manning;Jamal K Saleh;Khaled J Saleh

Our goals were to assess the Orthopaedic In-Training Examination to (1) determine the content of the trauma questions, (2) identify the content of the 3 most frequently referenced journals on the answer keys, and (3) evaluate the correlation between those contents.We reviewed the trauma-related Orthopaedic In-Training Examination questions and answer keys for 2002 through 2007. Content for test questions and cited literature was assessed with the same criteria: (1) category type, (2) anatomic location, (3) orthopedic focus, and (4) treatment type. For each of the 3 most frequently referenced journals, we weighted content by dividing the number of times it was referenced by the number of its trauma-related articles. We then compared the journal data individually and collectively to the data from the Orthopaedic In-Training Examination trauma questions. A chi-square analysis with Yates correction was used to determine differences. Questions and literature were similar in the most frequently addressed items in each of the 4 areas: category type (taxonomy 3, treatment), 52.4% and 60.7%, respectively; anatomic location (femur), 23.3% and 27.7%, respectively; orthopedic focus (fracture), 51.0% and 56.5%, respectively; and treatment type (multiple/nonspecific), 39.0% and 35.4%, respectively.The content correlation found between the questions and literature supports the idea that reviewing current literature may help prepare for the trauma content on the Orthopaedic In-Training Examination.",,Payam Farjoodi;David R Marker;Jeremy R McCallum 4th;Frank J Frassica;Simon C Mears

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of self-citation on the h-index among orthopedic investigators. The study cohort consisted of program directors, chairpersons, and faculty at orthopedic surgery residency programs in the United States. The Scopus database was used to determine the h-index and number of citations ± self-citations. The total number of publications was correlated with the change in the h-index via self-citation. A total of 463 researchers were included (198 National Institutes of Health-funded faculty, 147 chairpersons, 118 program directors). Of these researchers, 83.8% cited previous work at least once (mean, 123.9 ± 277.6). Self-citations accounted for 5.8% of all citations. Including these citations increased the author h-index from 18.5 ± 14.9 to 19.2 ± 15.6 (P < .001). A minority of researchers (36.3%, P < .001) had increased their h-index via self-citation (range, 0-11). The proportional increase in the h-index via self-citation was positively related to the number of publications (P < .001).

In this investigation, the trends in question taxonomy and the levels of evidence of the references for sports medicine questions on the Orthopaedic In-Training Examination (OITE) during a 12-year period were evaluated. Sports medicine questions were obtained from the OITEs administered between 2005 and 2007 and between 2014 and 2016. The taxonomy of each question was characterized, and levels of evidence for all references were assigned using American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines. Question taxonomy and article levels of evidence from 2005 to 2007 were compared with those from 2014 to 2016. Sports medicine questions comprised 8% of the OITEs in both examination groups. The questions from 2014 to 2016 had a higher mean taxonomic level (2.26 vs 1.52, P=.0001) and a greater proportion of studies with high levels of evidence (levels 1 and 2) (21% vs 10%, P=.027).

References from 2014 to 2016 were, on average, 2 years older than those from earlier examinations. This study indicated that sports medicine questions on recent OITEs cite references of higher levels of evidence and contain higher taxonomic question structure than examinations 10 to 12 years ago. However, the majority of questions still cite articles with low levels of evidence or nonprimary sources.

An electronic survey was sent to orthopedics residents, residency program directors, and orthopedic sports medicine attending physicians in the United States. The frequency and perceived effectiveness of 10 types of adjunctive arthroscopic skills training was assessed. Residents and faculty members were asked to rate their confidence in resident ability to perform common arthroscopic procedures. Surveys were completed by 40 of 152 (26.3%) orthopedic residency program directors, 70 of 426 (16.4%) sports medicine faculty, and 235 of 3,170 (7.4%) orthopedic residents. The use of adjunctive methods of training varied from only 9.8% of programs with virtual reality training to 80.5% of programs that used reading of published materials to develop arthroscopic skill. Practice on cadaveric specimens was viewed as the most effective and preferred adjunctive method of training. Residents trained on cadaveric specimens reported increased confidence in their ability to perform arthroscopic procedures. The resources for developing arthroscopic surgical skill vary considerably across orthopedic residency programs in the United States. Adjunctive training methods were perceived to be effective at supplementing traditional training in the operating room.",,Ryan Koehler;Tamara John;Jeffrey Lawler;Claude Moorman 3rd;Gregg Nicandri

However, recent changes in health care have limited resident-patient exposures. With the reported success of simulation training in the surgical literature, the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) and Residency Review Committee for Orthopaedic Surgery have required that surgical simulation training be a component of the intern curricula in orthopedic surgical residencies. This study examined the short-term effectiveness of an orthopedic ""intern boot camp"" covering 7 of 17 simulation training concept modules published by the ABOS. Eight orthopedic post-graduate year 1 (PGY-1) residents (study group) completed a structured 3-month curriculum and were compared with 7 post-graduate year 2 (PGY-2) residents (comparison group) who had just completed their orthopedic surgical internship. Seven core skills were assessed using both task-specific and global rating scales. The PGY-1 residents demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in all 7 modules with respect to their task-specific pre-test scores: sterile technique (P=.001), wound closure (P<.001), knot tying (P=.017), casting and splinting (P<.001), arthrocentesis (P=.01), basics of internal fixation (P<.001), and compartment syndrome evaluation (P=.004). After the camp, PGY-1 and -2 scores in task-specific measures were not significantly different.

Learning curve reports from other surgical specialties and from orthopaedic surgery can be analyzed to identify the strengths and weaknesses of learning curve reporting. Single-surgeon series and registry data can be analyzed to understand learning challenges and to develop a personalized learning plan. Learning curve reports from single-surgeon series have several limitations that result from the limited dataset reported and inconsistencies in the way data are reported. Conversely, learning curve reports from registry data are likely to have greater generalizability, but are largely beneficial retrospectively, after data from a sufficient number of surgeons are assessed. There is a pressing need for surgeons to develop improved and consistent standards for learning curve reporting. Although registry data may provide better prospective measures in the future, the implementation of such registries faces several challenges. Despite substantial limitations, single-surgeon series remain the most effective way for practicing surgeons to assess their learning challenge and develop an appropriate learning plan.",,Wade T Gofton;Michael Solomon;Tyson Gofton;Alex Pagé;Paul R Kim;Caleb Netting;Mohit Bhandari;Paul E Beaulé

It also highlights the current advances and capability of this technology. Application of the CAD/CAM technology in orthopaedics is relatively new. Three broad areas of applications can be defined: (1) three-dimensional reconstructions of skeletal structure based on any of the imaging technique, i.e. CT scan, MRI or X-ray, to analyse, simulate, design and evaluate orthopaedic procedures without having to actually perform the surgery; (2) the production of plastic or wax models for surgeons to have global impressions and understanding of complex cases of bone and joint disorders and the possibility of using the physical models as templates to sculpt allograft pre-operatively; and (3) to design and manufacture geometrically optimal standard and customised implants. CAD/CAM technology is also rapidly developing in the field of prosthetics, orthotics and orthopaedics footwear. The advantages offered include shorter delivery time, more consistent design, quantifiable rectification and ""modern"" or remote manufacturing. Apart from these applied usage, the CAD/CAM technology is also an effective tool for education and training. The application of CAD/CAM technology in orthopaedics and its related fields has been shown to have tremendous potential, but may appear to be too esoteric, complex and costly at the present moment.

This study aimed to gauge financial literacy, debt, and retirement planning in United States orthopedic surgery residents. Willingness to participate in formalized financial education was also assessed. Eighty-five allopathic orthopedic surgery residents in the United States completed a 14-question anonymous online survey in 2016. The survey assessed demographic data, self-assessed financial knowledge, amount of credit card debt and loans, preparation for retirement, and willingness to participate in formal didactic education on these topics. Most respondents derive their financial knowledge from personal research (51%), whereas only 4 per cent have a formal curriculum. Despite most respondents reporting more than $200,000 in outstanding loans, only 31 per cent create and stick to a budget. Few programs offer retirement advice, and 48 per cent of respondents save $0 toward retirement. Eighty-five per cent of residents expressed interest in learning about personal investment, savings, and retirement planning. Orthopedic surgery residents carry significant debt and do not achieve their high-income potential until disproportionately later in life.

The goal was to have objective markers of performance that would serve as a gauge to determine a program's accreditation. To determine the experiences of orthopedic residency programs with regard to the ACGME's core competencies, a national survey was administered to orthopedic program directors and selected orthopedic residents. Of those orthopedic programs that responded, most appeared to be complying with the ACGME requirements. Both directors and residents thought patient care and medical knowledge ranked most important, while practice-based learning and systems-based practice were assigned the lowest ranks. Barriers to implementation of the core competencies included low priority compared with clinical duties, lack of faculty or resident education, and lack of formal orthopedic core competencies. Residents and program directors agreed that their programs would benefit from a definition of each of the core competencies, including a greater commitment to the processes involved in surgical procedures.

Working hour restrictions and a drive towards senior led care demands that proficiency be gained in a shorter period of time whilst requiring a greater skill set than that in the past. The resulting conflict between service provision and training has necessitated the development of alternative methods in order to compensate for the reduction in 'hands-on' experience. Simulation training provides the opportunity to develop surgical skills in a controlled environment whilst minimising risks to patient safety, operating theatre usage and financial expenditure. Many options for simulation exist within orthopaedics from cadaveric or prosthetic models, to arthroscopic simulators, to advanced virtual reality and three-dimensional software tools. There are limitations to this form of training, but it has significant potential for trainees to achieve competence in procedures prior to real-life practice. The evidence for its direct transferability to operating theatre performance is limited but there are clear benefits such as increasing trainee confidence and familiarity with equipment. With progressively improving methods of simulation available, it is likely to become more important in the ongoing and future training and assessment of orthopaedic surgeons.",,Euan R B Stirling;Thomas L Lewis;Nicholas A Ferran

Advocates stress their historical significance, their ability to simplify complex terminology and their addition of character to science. Opponents cite the controversy among those eponyms and highlight the lack of both scientific and historical accuracy. The law of Nonoriginal Malappropriate Eponymous Nomenclature (NOMEN) suggests that no phenomenon is named after the individual(s) who originally described it. We aimed to determine whether this law is applicable to various clinical conditions and signs relevant to paediatric orthopaedics. We selected a series of 10 eponyms and performed a thorough literature review. In all cases, a description was identified preceding that from whom the disease received its eponymous name. We were also able to identify what we believe to be the earliest recorded description of each disease and sign. Our examples confirm the law of NOMEN in the field of paediatric orthopaedics. We suggest that irregularities in the descriptions and meanings of eponyms are identified and updated.",,Nick Aresti;Manoj Ramachandran

Residency graduates from a single training program were asked to complete a survey that gathered demographic information and had surgeons rate their understanding of 9 general business and practice management skills and the importance of these skills in their current practice situation. The amount of necessary business knowledge they lacked at graduation was defined as a functional knowledge deficiency (FKD) and was calculated as the difference between the reported importance of a topic in current practice and the level of understanding of that topic at graduation (larger FKD indicates greater deficiency). Those in physician-managed practices reported significantly higher levels of understanding of economic analytical tools than those in nonphysician-managed practices. There were no other statistically significant differences among groups. Hospital-employed physicians had the lowest overall FKD (4.0), followed by those in academic practices (5.1) and private practices (5.9). Graduating orthopedic surgeons appear to be inadequately prepared to effectively manage business issues in their practices, as evidenced by the low overall knowledge levels and high FKDs.",,D Joshua Miller;Thomas W Throckmorton;Frederick M Azar;James H Beaty;S Terry Canale;David R Richardson
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10818976/,The history of the Campbell Clinic,"The history of the Campbell Clinic is deeply seated in the accomplishments of Dr. Willis Cahoon Campbell. At the age of 26 he decided to live in Memphis and become an orthopaedic surgeon. At the time Memphis was growing rapidly and orthopaedic surgery was evolving as a surgical specialty. These conditions provided him with the opportunity to do many things that were visionary. He established the Campbell Clinic and the orthopaedic department of the medical school and aided in founding hospitals and clinics for private patients and patients who were indigent. His major contributions to the field of orthopaedics include the recruitment of outstanding associates who would follow and build on his high standards of performance, the establishment of an outstanding residency program, the publication of Campbell's Operative Orthopaedics, and providing leadership for many orthopaedic surgeons. It can be said without reservation that Campbell and the early staff members played an important role in the growth of orthopaedic surgery essentially from its infancy and into the second half of the century. The legacy of excellence that Campbell and all the members of the staff established has continued to be the hallmark of the Campbell Clinic.",,R A Calandruccio

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14575261/,The Vienna heritage of Iowa orthopaedics,"Strong traditions of basic research, clinical innovation, teaching and integrating science and evaluation of outcomes into clinical practice have characterized University of Iowa orthopaedics for ninety years. These traditions were brought to Iowa City from Vienna when Iowa City was a town of fewer than 10,000 people in a sparcely populated rural state. In the last third of the 19th century, surgeons at the University of Vienna, led by Theodore Billroth (1829-1894), helped transform the practice of surgery. They developed new more effective procedures, analyzed the results of their operations, promoted the emergence and growth of surgical specialties and sought understanding of tissue structure, physiology and pathophysiology. Their efforts made Vienna one of the world's most respected centers for operative treatment, basic and clinical research and surgical education. Two individuals who followed Billroth, Eduard Albert (1841-1900) and Adolf Lorenz (1854-1946) focussed their research and clinical practice on orthopaedics. Their successes in the study and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders led one of their students, Arthur Steindler (1878-1959), a 1902 graduate of the Vienna Medical School, to pursue a career in orthopaedics. Following medical school, he worked in Lorenz's orthopaedic clinic until 1907 when he joined John Ridlon (1852-1936) at the Chicago Home for Crippled Children. In 1910, Steindler became Professor of Orthopaedics at the Drake Medical School in Des Moines, Iowa, and, in 1913, John G. Bowman, the President of the University of Iowa, recruited him to establish an orthopaedic clinical and academic program in Iowa City. For the next third of a century he guided the development of the University of Iowa Orthopaedics Department, helped establish the fields of orthopaedic biomechanics and kinesiology and tirelessly stressed the importance of physiology, pathology and assessment of the outcomes of operations. From the legacy of Billroth, Albert and Lorenz, Arthur Steindler created an internationally recognized center for orthopaedic care, research and teaching in Iowa City.",,Joseph A Buckwalter

In a survey among Dutch orthopedic surgeons, development and use of evidence-based guidelines was perceived as one of the best ways of moving from opinion-based to evidence-based orthopedic practice. The increasing number of guidelines means that knowing how to make a critical appraisal of guidelines is now a key part of every surgeon's life. This is particularly true because guidelines use varying systems to judge the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations. In this manuscript we discuss what a guideline is, where we can find guidelines, how to evaluate the quality of guidelines, and finally provide an example on the different steps of guideline development.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22385456/,Orthopedic specialty hospitals: centers of excellence or greed machines?,"Orthopedic specialty hospitals have recently been the subject of debate. They are patient-centered, physician-friendly health care alternatives that take advantage of the economic efficiencies of specialization. Medically, they provide a higher quality of care and increase patient and physician satisfaction. Economically, they are more efficient and profitable than general hospitals. They also positively affect society through the taxes they pay and the beneficial aspects of the competition they provide to general hospitals. Their ability to provide a disruptive innovation to the existing hospital industry will lead to lower costs and greater access to health care. However, critics say that physician ownership presents potential conflicts of interest and leads to overuse of medical care. Some general hospitals are suffering as a result of unfair specialty hospital practices, and a few drastic medical complications have occurred at specialty hospitals. Specialty hospitals have been scrutinized for increasing the inequality of health care and continue to be a target of government regulations. In this article, the pros and cons are examined, and the Emory Orthopaedics and Spine Hospital is analyzed as an example. Orthopedic specialty hospitals provide excellent care and are great assets to society. Competition between specialty and general hospitals has provided added value to patients and taxpayers. However, physicians must take more responsibility in their appropriate and ethical leadership. It is critical to recognize financial conflicts of interest, disclose ownership, and act ethically. Patient care cannot be compromised.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28475497/,A Perspective on the Effect of the 80-Hour Work Week: Has It Changed the Graduating Orthopaedic Resident?,"Orthopaedic residency education has changed substantially in recent decades because of the imposition of the 80-hour work week, a decrease in quality and quantity of general surgical education, regulations mandating closer trainee supervision, and an expansion of orthopaedic subspecialty rotations. These factors pose a challenge in efforts to prepare competent, confident, cautious, caring, and communicative orthopaedic residents within the traditional 5-year program. Evidence suggests that contemporary graduates are more intelligent, better balanced in life and work, and more in touch with humanistic aspects of medicine than were earlier graduates. Yet insufficient competence and confidence in surgical skills after residency and a lack of ""ownership"" of patient care have become an increasing concern of educators and trainees. The concept of 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to achieve mastery of a technical skill applies to orthopaedic residency education.

Simultaneous reductions in revenues and increases in the cost to practice medicine pose the greatest challenge to maintaining the academic orthopaedic department. Fundamental differences exist between the private practice and academic orthopaedic surgeon. Most importantly, while their value systems may differ, appropriate incentives (tangible and intangible) must exist to promote growth and retention in a non-private practice setting. A proper compensation plan must consider revenue and non-revenue-generating activities within the context of the academic orthopaedic department to maintain the department's mission.

Interested orthopedic residents may be unaware of opportunities for leadership involvement in professional and subspecialty organizations. This article investigates whether national and subspecialty organizations offer membership to residents, allow residents to participate in committees, and provide opportunities for scholarly activity and mentorship. The authors surveyed 20 national orthopedic professional and subspecialty societies to evaluate the availability and cost of resident membership, meeting attendance and participation, research funding, committee membership, and mentorship opportunities.

Five of 20 societies allowed residents to serve on committees, with a total of 14 total positions for residents. Four organizations provided formalized mentorship programs to residents. Although opportunities for resident involvement in subspecialty and professional societies are available in the majority of groups surveyed, the Orthopaedic Trauma Association and American Society for Surgery of the Hand provided the most comprehensive collection of opportunities. Residents should also pursue involvement in other organizations that may be more readily accessible, such as local, state, and regional orthopedic and medical societies.

All applicants to the ABOS Part II examination from 2004 to 2016 were classified by their self-reported fellowship training history using the ABOS Part II examination database. Trends in the number of applicants completing multiple fellowships and the types of fellowships combined were analyzed. In addition, cases performed by applicants who had performed multiple fellowships were analyzed to determine what percentage were within their chosen subspecialties. A total of 9776 applicants to ABOS Part II were included in the database from 2004 to 2016, including 444 (4.5%) applicants who completed more than one fellowship. There were 43 different combinations of fellowships; the most common additional fellowships were trauma (40.1%), sports medicine (38.7%), and joints (30.4%). The most common combinations were joints and sports medicine (10.6%) and foot and ankle and sports medicine (10.1%). A significant increase occurred in physicians training in both pediatric orthopedics and sports medicine (P=.02). The percentage of cases within the applicants' chosen specialties ranged from 91.4% in sports to 73.6% in tumor. Multiple fellowship applicants represent a small percentage of all applicants, and although subspecialization in orthopedics is increasing, no increasing trend toward multiple fellowships within this dataset was observed.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22048105/,The disruptive orthopaedic surgeon: implications for patient safety and malpractice liability,"Disruptive physician behavior imperils patient safety, erodes the morale of other health care providers, and dramatically increases the risk of malpractice litigation. Increasing patient volume, decreasing physician reimbursement, malpractice litigation, elevated stress, and growing job dissatisfaction have been implicated in disruptive behavior, which has emerged as one of the major challenges in health care. Because the aging patient population relies increasingly on orthopaedic services to maintain quality of life, improving professionalism and eradicating disruptive behavior are urgent concerns in orthopaedic surgery. Although many steps have been taken by The Joint Commission to improve patient care and define disruptive behavior, there is further room for improvement by physicians. Barriers to eliminating disruptive behavior by orthopaedic surgeons include fear of retaliation, lack of awareness among the surgeon's peers, and financial factors. Surgeons have a duty to address patterns of negative peer behavior for the benefit of patient care. This manuscript addresses the causes and consequences of disruptive physician behavior as well as management strategies, especially in orthopaedic surgery.",,Pranay Patel;Brooke S Robinson;Wendy M Novicoff;Gary L Dunnington;Michael J Brenner;Khaled J Saleh
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22495859/,Trends in the orthopedic job market and the importance of fellowship subspecialty training,"Previous studies have examined possible incentives for pursuing orthopedic fellowship training, but we are unaware of previously published studies reporting the trends in the orthopedic job market since the acceptance of certain criteria for fellowship programs by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) in 1985. We hypothesized that, since the initiation of accredited postresidency fellowship programs, job opportunities for fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeons have increased and job opportunities for nonfellowship-trained orthopedic surgeons have decreased. We reviewed the job advertisements printed in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, American Volume, for the years 1984, 1994, 2004, and 2009. We categorized the job opportunities as available for either a general (nonfellowship-trained) orthopedic surgeon or a fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeon. Based on the advertisements posted in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, American Volume, a trend exists in the orthopedic job market toward seeking fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeons. In the years 1984, 1994, 2004, and 2009, the percentage of job opportunities seeking fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeons was 16.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.1%-20.3%), 40.6% (95% CI, 38.1%-43.1%), 52.2% (95% CI, 48.5%-55.9%), and 68.2% (95% CI, 65.0%-71.4%), respectively.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22508437/,Multi-investigator collaboration in orthopaedic surgery research compared to other medical fields,"An increasing emphasis has been placed across health care on evidence-based medicine with higher level studies, such as randomized trials and prospective cohort studies. Historically, clinical research in orthopaedic surgery has been dominated by studies with low patient numbers from a limited number of surgeons. The purpose of this study was to test our hypothesis that orthopaedics has fewer multi-center collaborative studies as compared to other medical disciplines. We chose three leading journals from general medicine, a leading journal from the surgical subspecialties of obstetrics and gynecology, ophthalmology and otolaryngology, and three leading journals from orthopaedic surgery based on highest impact factor. We compared the percentage of collaborative studies and the number of contributing institutions and authors in original research manuscripts published in 2009 between general medical, surgical subspecialty and orthopaedic surgery journals. A significantly higher percentage of manuscripts resulted from multicenter collaborative efforts in the general medical literature (p < 0.000001) and the other surgical subspecialty literature (p < 0.000001) compared to the orthopaedic surgery literature. Manuscripts published in the general medical journals came from more institutions (p < 0.0001) and had significantly more authors (p < 0.000001) than those published in the orthopaedic surgery journals. There is an opportunity to stimulate greater multicenter collaborative research, which correlates with increased patient numbers, a higher level of evidence and more generalizable findings, in the orthopaedic surgery community. These efforts can be supported through increased funding, surgeon participation, and appropriate expansion of authorship for multicenter studies in orthopaedic journals.",,Robert H Brophy;Matthew V Smith;Christian Latterman;Morgan H Jones;Emily K Reinke;David C Flanigan;Rick W Wright;Brian R Wolf

This relationship is multifactorial and includes new technology development, medical education, orthopaedic research, and patient education. Acting individually and collectively, the profession and the industry advance their standing by focusing on improved patient care. Although the industry, the profession, and the patient have many shared interests, they also may have real or potential conflicts of interests. The patient's interest in the quality of treatment outcome is shared by the profession and industry. However, the interests of the profession may include issues related to the success of their practices, management of their time, and advancement of their skills.

The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical preparedness of first-year orthopaedic attending surgeons who trained with ACGME duty hour regulations versus those trained without regulations. Senior orthopaedic surgeons with greater than 10 years of experience were surveyed and results indicate that first-year attendings who trained with ACGME duty hour regulations required more supervision reviewing cases preoperatively, required more assistance completing operative cases, had inferior technical skills, had more major operative complications, had poorer physical exam skills, and delivered an inferior quality of care. Private attendings were most critical. In the postregulatory era, residency programs must optimize the resident's time to ensure competency on graduation.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29558376/,Objective Methodology to Assess Meaningful Research Productivity by Orthopaedic Residency Departments: Validation Against Widely Distributed Ranking Metrics and Published Surrogates,"The mission of any academic orthopaedic training program can be divided into 3 general areas of focus: clinical care, academic performance, and research. Clinical care is evaluated on clinical volume, patient outcomes, patient satisfaction, and becoming increasingly focused on data-driven quality metrics. Academic performance of a department can be used to motivate individual surgeons, but objective measures are used to define a residency program. Annual in-service examinations serve as a marker of resident knowledge base, and board pass rates are clearly scrutinized. Research productivity, however, has proven harder to objectively quantify. In an effort to improve transparency and better account for conflicts of interest, bias, and self-citation, multiple bibliometric measures have been developed. Rather than using individuals' research productivity as a surrogate for departmental research, we sought to establish an objective methodology to better assess a residency program's ability to conduct meaningful research. In this study, we describe a process to assess the number and quality of publications produced by an orthopaedic residency department. This would allow chairmen and program directors to benchmark their current production and make measurable goals for future research investment. The main goal of the benchmarking system is to create an ""h-index"" for residency programs. To do this, we needed to create a list of relevant articles in the orthopaedic literature. We used the Journal Citation Reports. This publication lists all orthopaedic journals that are given an impact factor rating every year. When we accessed the Journal Citation Reports database, there were 72 journals included in the orthopaedic literature section. To ensure only relevant, impactful journals were included, we selected journals with an impact factor greater than 0.95 and an Eigenfactor Score greater than 0.00095. After excluding journals not meeting these criteria, we were left with 45 journals. We performed a Scopus search over a 10-year period of these journals and created a database of articles and their affiliated institutions. We performed several iterations of this to maximize the capture of articles attributed to institutions with multiple names. Based off of this extensive database, we were able to analyze all allopathic US residency programs based on their quality research productivity. We believe this as a novel methodology to create a system by which residency program chairmen and directors can assess progress over time and accurate comparison with other programs.",,Louis B Jones;Sameer Goel;Leroy Y Hung;Matthew L Graves;Clay A Spitler;George V Russell;Patrick F Bergin

There is also controversy as to which device should be used for fixation of the syndesmosis, how many devices should be used, how many cortices the screws should engage, and whether, when, and where the screws should be removed. We conducted a study to determine how orthopedic surgeons manage these injuries. In a survey, we asked orthopedic trauma and foot and ankle fellowship directors and members of the Orthopaedic Trauma Association and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society how they routinely treated the syndesmotic injury component of Danis-Weber type C or Lauge-Hansen pronation-external rotation type IV ankle fractures. The overall response rate was 50% (77/153). Fifty-one percent of respondents routinely used 3.5-mm cortical screws, 24% routinely used 4.5-mm cortical screws, and 14% routinely used a suture fixation device. Forty-four percent of respondents routinely used 1 screw, 44% routinely used 2 screws, and the rest were undecided between 1 and 2 screws. Twenty-nine percent of respondents engaged 3 cortices with syndesmotic screws, and 67% engaged 4 cortices. Syndesmotic screws were routinely removed 65% of the time and left in place 35% of the time. Routine removal of syndesmotic screws was done in the operating room in 95% of cases; it was done at 3 months in 49% of cases, at 4 months in 37%, and at 6 months in 12%. The most common method for treating syndesmotic injuries was through use of 3.5-mm screws engaging 4 cortices routinely removed in the operating room at 3 months.

Respondents were asked for their opinions of and experiences with DTCA, including the influence of DTCA on surgeon and patient decision making. Greater than 98% of surgeon respondents had experience with patients who were exposed to DTCA. The majority of surgeon respondents reported DTCA had an overall negative impact on their practice and their interaction with patients (74%), and their patients often were confused or misinformed about the appropriate treatment for their condition based on an advertisement (77%). Fifty-two percent of patient respondents recalled seeing or hearing advertisements related to hip or knee arthroplasty.

After Heister, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, orthopaedic medicine in Germany developed uniformly. In a period when few doctors were interested in a separate discipline of orthopaedics, Germany led in this field. Heine devoted himself to the development of the new profession of orthopaedics, and in 1816, he opened the first orthopaedic institute on German soil in the former monastery of St. Stephen, which later became known as the Karolinen-Institut. Along with Heine and his family, the special development of orthopaedics in Berlin may be attributed to the work of Dieffenbach who, in 1832, became professor at the University of Berlin and in 1840 director of the Clinical Institute for Surgery at Charité Hospital.",German orthopaedic history; Orthopedic history.,Philippe Hernigou
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9863339/,[Development of orthopedics and founding of the Clinic for Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology in Novi Sad],"A study of the development of the orthopaedic surgery in Novi Sad from the antique times till 1980 when the Clinic for Orthopaedic. Surgery and Traumatology was established has been carried out. Development from Roman Times till the Second World War. The first material evidence of the surgical activities in this area originates from the epoch of the Roman Empire, when under the emperor Augustus (Augustus, 27 B.C.-14 A.D.), the northern border of the Empire was established and fortified on the river Danube. At that time on the place of the contemporary Petrovaradin Fortress, a small fortification with a permanent garrison, called Cusum, was built. As it was proved by excavation of the surgical instruments from the Roman time at the nearby Sremska Mitrovica (Sirmium) the surgery in the Roman legions was quite developed and it could be concluded that some forms of surgery and orthopaedics were practised in the antique Cusum as well. There is no reliable evidence about the health service in the area after the Roman era till the 1689 when Petrovaradin was finally sized by Austrian troops from the Turks, and when the first recorded hospital (Petrovaradin Military Hospital) in this region was founded. At that time on the northern shore of the river Danube a new settlement, developing later into the town of Novi Sad, was established. Surgery together with orthopaedics at that time were performed by the so-called ""feldschers"", and then by primitive, self-taught surgeons who were actually experienced barbers, while educated doctors started to practice surgery only in the 19th century when the first surgical department in Novi Sad was founded in the Great Town Hospital, and for years after that, the orthopaedics was practised by general surgeons. The foundation of the Anglo-Yugoslav Children's Hospital for Tuberculosis of the Bones and Joints at Sremska Kamenica in 1934 by Dr. Katherine S. Macphail, a great benefactress of our people, was of great importance for the development of orthopaedics in this area as it was the first orthopaedic hospital in the country. The first small unit for orthopaedics, as a part of the Surgical Department of the Novi Sad State Hospital, was established in 1937 and led by a surgeon, Dr. Nikola Pravdica. Development from the Second World War till the 1980. After the Second World War the Main Provincial Hospital with two surgical departments was established in Novi Sad. At the so-called Second Surgical Department led by Dr. Nestor Teodorovic a small unit for traumatology and orthopaedics was founded in 1946, which functioned as such till 1953. The first properly trained orthopaedic surgeon was Dr. Stojan Letic who passed the specialty exam in 1953 and was attached to the Second Surgical Department of the Main Provincial Hospital. The first independent Orthopaedic and Traumatologic Department, led by an experienced orthopaedic surgeon, Dr. Vladimir Razenj, was established in 1956. From 1959 till 1963 the department was led by Prim. Dr. Dobrivoje Gradistanac. In 1963 this department together with the former ""English Hospital"" at Sremska Kamenica were incorporated into the so-called Clinic for Surgical Diseases and divided in the Orthopaedic (led by Prof. Milenko Dosen) and separated Traumatologic (led by Prim. Stojan Letić) departments which existed as such till 1975 when they were integrated again into a single unit which evolved into the Clinic for Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology in 1980.",,Z Mikić

Of $54,925,833 in NIH funding allocated to orthopaedic surgery faculty in 2013, 3% of faculty and 31% of departments were funded. 16% of funded institutions had a funded DC whereas 65% had a funded RD. Department productivity and funding were highly correlated to leadership productivity and funding(p< 0.05). Mean funding was $1,700,000 for departments with a NIH-funded RD, $104,000 for departments with an unfunded RD, and $72,000 for departments with no RD. These findings suggest that orthopaedic department academic success is directly associated with scholarly productivity and funding of both DC and RD.

His life is a compelling example of how an individual can make major contributions to the advancement of medical science and practice. His clinical interests spanned the entire range of musculoskeletal disorders including developmental, genetic, infectious, neoplastic and neuromuscular diseases, and their operative and nonoperative treatment. He founded the clinical and academic Orthopaedic Surgery programs at the University of Iowa in Iowa City and directed their growth for 34 years. During that time his clinical work, scholarship, and teaching helped the University of Iowa become a national and international orthopaedic center. He helped establish a statewide system to provide medical care for indigent patients and personally treated more than 70,000 patients, many of them children crippled by polio, tuberculosis, spastic paralysis, scoliosis, congenital deformities, and degenerative neuromuscular diseases. To improve the function of the weakened and deformed limbs of the children, he devised various innovative operations. He wrote more than 130 papers and nine books in several languages on the natural history, etiology, and treatment of musculoskeletal diseases and injuries, pioneered the application of biomechanics to evaluation and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders, and wrote the first comprehensive text on the mechanics of human movement. He taught more than 300 orthopaedists, and when Ruth Jackson, the individual recognized as the first woman orthopaedic surgeon in the United States, decided to pursue a career in orthopaedics, she sought out Arthur Steindler and received her formal orthopaedic education under his direction.

No study has evaluated the United States national incidence of defensive medicine in the field of orthopedic surgery. In the study reported here, we investigated the practice of defensive medicine and the resultant financial implications of such behavior by orthopedic surgeons in the US. A Web-based survey was sent to 2000 orthopedic surgeons in the US. Of the 1214 respondents, 1168 (96%) reported having practiced defensive medicine by ordering imaging, laboratory tests, specialist referrals, or hospital admissions mainly to avoid possible malpractice liability. On average, 24% of all ordered tests were for defensive reasons. Mean national Medicare payment information was used to calculate the cost of defensive medicine per respondent: approximately $100,000 per year. With there being 20,400 practicing orthopedic surgeons in the US, we estimated that the national cost of defensive medicine for the specialty of orthopedic surgery is $2 billion annually.

As a result, orthopedic attending surgeons and residents are exposed to more radiation, increasing the risk of cancer and radiation-induced cataracts compared with the general population and those who work in other surgical specialties. The magnitude of radiation exposure depends on the susceptibility of the tissues affected, medical specialty, the position of the C-arm, distance from the radiation beam, level of difficulty of the surgical procedure, surgeon experience, level of resident training, and level of supervision by the attending surgeon. However, little information is available on the effect of supervision level on radiation exposure for orthopedic senior residents. The goal of this study was to investigate whether level of supervision by the attending surgeon affects the radiation exposure of orthopedic senior residents during surgical treatment of proximal femur fracture with cephalomedullary nail fixation. This retrospective cohort study was performed from January 2019 to March 2019. No significant relationship between supervision level and radiation exposure of senior residents was observed. Supervision level does not significantly affect radiation exposure for senior residents; therefore, the implementation of standardized training in radiation safety may be a more essential measure to decrease radiation exposure.

Surgical treatment, local excision, with unacceptable mortality led to amputation in the 1870s and remained so until limb-sparing resection was cautiously embarked on in the mid-1900s. Nonsurgical adjuvant therapy was first devised in the 1880s (as Coley's toxins) but remained largely ineffective until the advent of chemotherapy in the 1970s. The combination of these techniques in the past 30 years, and the vastly improved staging and reconstructive techniques has led to the current preponderance of limb-salvaging surgery and greatly improved survival rates.

It is based on archival materials, publications in medical journals and articles from the daily press of that time. The author presents little-known facts concerning Dr. Gabryszewski's occupational and academic activity and his work at the Surgery Dept. of Lvov University as well as his habilitation dissertation, regarded as the first attempt to position orthopaedics as distinct from surgery in Poland. The article also describes his long-term work at the private Orthopaedic Facility established in 1898 in Lvov which later incorporated the Zander Institute in 1908. The Zander Institute was the first in Galicia to offer exercise machines designed by Dr. Gustav Zander, imported from Stockholm and enjoying an extraordinary popularity in the world. Dr. Gabryszewski's practice as a spa doctor, which he pursued in Iwonicz Zdrój in the summer months, is also presented. Dr. A. Gabryszewski introduced comprehensive rehabilitation to the treatment of orthopaedic patients both at the Surgery Dept. of Lvov University and at his Orthopaedic Facility. He used therapeutic gymnastics (particularly mechanotherapy), therapeutic massage, physical therapy and orthopaedic aids. Analysis of the source materials leads to unequivocal conclusions attesting to Dr. A.

The G-DRG-Version 1.0 that was drawn up in connection with an executive order law is to a large degree identical to the Australian AR-DRG-Version 4.1. Adjustments to German requirements were made only marginally. Therefore it is necessary for every medical field to investigate by stock-taking to what extent currently practised German diagnostic and therapeutic measures are considered in the G-DRG-Version 1.0 and whether and where modifications and adaptations need to be made. In order to make qualified statements scientific evaluations of possible problems have to be made based German data. Therefore an evaluation was made of the mapping of the medical fields of orthopaedics and trauma surgery.

This will impact the organization, delivery, and funding of health care as the population ages. However, it is well recognized that resources in health care are limited and it is essential the resources available are used to best effect. Thus, there has been greater emphasis in the orthopaedic literature on the use of economics. Still, there is little discussion of whether and how the results of these economic methods can be further used to aid resource allocation decisions. We discuss the suitability of economic methods for priority setting in orthopaedic surgery, arguing economic evaluation alone is not sufficient for addressing resource allocation decisions.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12661388/,Organisational implications of concentration orthopaedic services,"The re-organisation of the acute health services in 1999 is causing many acute trusts to consider the practical implications of concentrating services. This may be in terms of the complete merger of departments at different units or a less radical policy of the alternation of the responsibility for emergency receiving between units. The benefits may include the opportunity to improve the quality of care by providing more specialist services, more attractive working conditions with a larger pool of specialists providing the on-call rota and enhanced opportunity for training. Economic theory indicates that concentration should lead to economies of scale by greater sharing of fixed overhead costs, whilst statistical theory specifies that concentration should produce a relative decline in the variability of demand. This paper examines the effects of concentration on emergency admissions in an orthopaedic department by means of a series of simulation experiments. It examines the potential economies of scale for theatre utilisation and bed usage associated with increasing the volume of non-elective patients. As the volume of patients increases so the relative variability of demand decreases and the relative demand for emergency operating theatre time declines. Concentration could offer savings on theatre time allocated to trauma patients, but the impact on wards is less significant with concentration having a limited effect on the demand for beds.",,J Bowers;G Mould

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19212579/,"The roles of funding source, clinical trial outcome, and quality of reporting in orthopedic surgery literature","Compared with nonfunded or peer-reviewed funded projects, industry-sponsored clinical trials have traditionally been associated with more positive results. This relationship has been extensively studied in the nonsurgical literature. Although a few authors have addressed specialties, little has been reported on orthopedic clinical trials and their association with funding, study outcome, and efforts to reduce bias after randomization across journals of multiple subspecialties. For the study reported here, we selected 5 major orthopedic subspecialty journals: Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (American Volume), Spine, Journal of Arthroplasty, Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma, and American Journal of Sports Medicine. We chose a 2-year limit for investigation (2002-2004); included all original randomized clinical trials reported in these 5 journals; and examined these trials for their study design, funding source, outcome, bias potential, and conclusion reached. Support for the 100 eligible orthopedic clinical trials was stated as coming from industry (26 trials, 26%), nonprofit sources (19 trials, 19%), and mixed sources (5 trials, 5%); no support was stated in 46 trials (46%), and support was not reported in 4 trials (4%). Of the 26 trials reporting industry support, 22 (85%) were graded as indicating an outcome favorable to the new treatment. The association between industry funding and favorable outcome was strong and significant (P<.001). In almost half of the studies reported in Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery and Spine, measures taken to reduce bias were not documented.",,Safdar N Khan;Matthew J Mermer;Elizabeth Myers;Harvinder S Sandhu

Characteristics of the orthopaedic workforce in Queensland in 1990 were analysed with regard to the total number of orthopaedic surgeons, their regional distribution, their ratio to the population and their age distribution. Similar statistics were derived for the years 1981 and 1986 and trends were examined. By projecting these trends, the number of surgeons likely to be practising in 2001 was estimated. Using projected population figures, the number of orthopaedic surgeons required in 2001 was calculated, assuming an optimum ratio of surgeons to population of one per 25,000. It was found that in 1990 sufficient orthopaedic surgeons were practising in Queensland but that there was some maldistribution.

The orthopaedic surgery that should be practised in many developing countries differs greatly from that in the contemporary Western world because of a different spectrum of disease, the consequences of uncontrolled disease processes and the less satisfactory conditions in which to function. Training in the home country is therefore essential and circumvents frustration and the brain drain from these countries. Poverty in material resources is not matched by poverty of intellect or resourcefulness, and we have much to learn from developing countries. Different cultures result in the needs of patients being quite different. Orthoses and prostheses need to be based on local crafts and resources, and some of these are illustrated. The Western world can best assist by having surgeons working, teaching and learning in the Developing World, using inexpensive means to treat the many and not to pamper the few.",,A L Eyre-Brook

The medal is being granted by the Chapter of the Medal as regarding for outstanding achievements for the Polish and world orthopaedics and rehabilitation. Profesor Stefan Kazimierz Malawski was born 26. 12. 1920 in the Vilnius area. In Vilnius he stated his medical studies, which he continued in Lwow and graduated in 1946 at the Marie Curie Skłodowska in Lublin. Professor Malawski's main field of interest were related to the problems related to tuberculosis of bones and joints and trauma of the lumbar and cervical spine. In the problems of bone tuberculosis he remains an unquestioned authority in Poland. His deep understanding of these clinical problems can be found in his text-book ""Tuberculosis of bones and joints"", which was printed in 1976. The information pertaining diagnosis and surgical treatment remain extremely valuable today. Another field of interest of Professor Malawski are pathologies of the spine. Disc disease, neoplasms of the spine, spinal stenosis and infections of the spine, spondylolisthesis are among many of his interests. This very wide field of interest can be dound in his 3 tome publication Spondyloorthopedics. His 166 papars printed in Poland and abroad bear proof of the Professors wide field of interest and deep knowledge. Professor Malawski was the first surgeon in Poland to perform surgery on the front elements of the spine in tuberculotic paraplegia. In 1958 he implemented surgical treatment of spine tumor--both primary and metastatic, by resecting them and stabilizing the spine with grafts. In the early 70's he focused on spinal stenosis. In the years 1982-1986 he was the Chairman of the Board of the Polish Orthopedic and Trauma Society. Professor Malawski introdued a modern set of Rules and Regulations, greatly simplifying the decision making process during General assemblies of the Society. Professor Malawski is undoubtedly a great successor to the active way of surgical thinking introduced by professor Adam Gruca. Professor Jerzy Król is among the greatest Polish orthopedic surgeons. He was born on 21st February 1926 in Baranowice (Nowogródek woiwodship). He graduated from high school in the underground schooling system during the Second World War, receiving his maturity exam in 1945 from the Konarski High Scool School of the Western Lands in Czestochowa. In 1945 the professor started his medical studies at Adam Mickiewicz University of Poznan, where he graduated in 1949. In 1950 he started his medical career in in Orthopedic Department of Poznan head by professor Wiktor Dega. Professor Król is the author of over 100 medical papers printed in national and international journals. His key fields of interest are congenital dislocation of the hip, hip arthroplasty, scoliosis and rehabilitaton and prosthesis problems. In 1968 he performed the first scoliosis correction with the Harrington rod in Poland as well as the implantation of the first McKee-Ferara hip prosthesis. He is the co-author of the text-book Orthopedics and Rehabilitation, Medical Rehabilitation and a number of WHO text books: Community Health Worker and Guide for prevention of Deformities in Poliomyelitis. He also took part in the publishing of the WHO text-book Rehabilitation Surgery, for which he received the Ministry of Health Award. He overlooked 7 Ph.D thesis and 4 papers qualifying for assistant professor. Between 1972 and 1995 professor Król worked as a WHO expert, as member of the Expert Committee for Rehabilitation. Between 1986-1987 head was the director of the Orthopedics and Rehabilitation Institute in Poznan. He resigned from this function due to his work with WHO in Madagaskar. After his return he was the head of the Orthopedic Department in Poznan University of Medical Sciennces until October 1996 when he retired.",,Andrzej Nowakowski;Kazimierz Rapała
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3174212/,Computer corner #19. The computer as an aid to the orthopaedic resident for record-keeping,"This paper delineates a simple method of assisting orthopaedic residents in computer-based record-keeping. A step-by-step example is used to show the ease with which this system can be employed and modified to fit individual needs. Record-keeping is important to verify case load to individual departments and to the Residency Review Committee. It also allows the use of the records for case reviews and research, as well as making the resident more computer-literate.",,J V Bear;T A DeCoster
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10818966/,The evolution of orthopaedic surgeons from bone and joint surgery at the University of Pennsylvania,"When the first medical school in the North American colonies was founded in 1765 at the Philadelphia College (University of Pennsylvania) there were only two branches of medicine physic (medicine) and surgery. Surgeons such as Philip Syng Physick, and his successors William Gibson, Henry Hollingsworth Smith, and D. Hayes Agnew, in addition to performing general surgery, treated patients with orthopaedic, ophthalmologic, and nuerosurgical problems. Treatment of patients with orthopaedic problems by surgeons continued at the University of Pennsylvania until DeForest Willard founded the Department of Orthopaedics in 1889. In the interval between 1805, when Physick was appointed the first professor of surgery at the University of Pennsylvania, and 1889 many ingenious instruments, splints, and operative procedures for treating patients with orthopaedic problems were developed. The author will describe some of the accomplishments of these pioneers.",,D Y Cooper
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2355024/,The initial examination for a Certificate of Added Qualifications in Surgery of the Hand,"A total of 510 candidates took the 1989 Examination for Added Qualifications in Surgery of the Hand, including 412 diplomates of the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery and ninety-eight diplomates of the American Board of Surgery. Most candidates reported that they had intensive practices in hand surgery and large annual case-loads, and most had taken a hand fellowship. However, there were significant differences between diplomates of the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery and diplomates of the American Board of Surgery regarding these variables. The psychometric characteristics of the examination were very good. The average difficulty value was 77.6 per cent correct. The average item-discrimination value was high, and the total test reliability coefficient was 0.89. In general, the candidates' performance was very good, although there was a wide range in scores. A passing score of 66.3 per cent correct was selected, resulting in an over-all failure rate of 7.6 per cent, with 471 candidates passing and thirty-nine failing the examination. There were significant relationships between performance on the examination and several background variables, such as percentage of practice in hand surgery, having taken a hand fellowship, and size of the annual case-load.",,J R Urbaniak;G E Cruft;T W Biester
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3715528/,Educating medical academicians: a follow-up of the Vanderbilt Orthopaedic Training Grant,"This study is the retrospective review of an orthopedic surgery training grant (USPHS Training Grant No. AM 05494) at Vanderbilt University that was funded from 1965 through 1969. This training grant was directed toward the production of academic orthopedic surgeons. The director of the training grant, J. William Hillman, MD, was an educator of acute insight who realized the need for highly motivated orthopedic educators. This need is still present. An examination of the rationale of career choices of those who participated in the grant reveals how little has changed over the years. At the same time, a large number of students who participated in the program now hold academic positions in their chosen specialties.",,W W Robertson Jr
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8131320/,The rise of academic orthopaedic surgery during the past 44 years,"In accepting this invitation to write a prefatory chapter as a mini professional autobiography, it has become all too obvious that this has touched a few nerve endings that had healed many years ago. Contemplating personal experiences, thoughts, and philosophies and then writing them should have a purpose. During these past 44 years, I have had the good fortune to share in the breaking away of orthopaedics as a clinical practice, into an academic and scientific subject. Such a radical and difficult birth has been in the presence of many able and good fellow travellers and perhaps, therefore, may serve as a guide for the future by those who care to follow. The mixture of clinical practice with caring for people, teaching, and research has to be bound securely together by academic professors. This has presented the greatest challenge to me and certainly the greatest difficulty, because we have all faced criticism, not always constructive, from these three separate cultures. Even so, our responsibility has been to integrate science and medicine sensibly. Richards described universities as being places of high technology and remoteness from reality. In my experience having spent most of my professional life in British and American universities, the reality has always been too near and real.",,R B Duthie
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4048641/,[Rehabilitation of the physically handicapped--rehabilitation of the gainfully employed orthopedic patient],"Rehabilitation of physically disabled persons and resettlement of employed orthopaedic patients into social and working life are integral components of orthopaedics. Unless the patient is reintegrated, orthopaedic care remains incomplete. It is absolutely necessary to develop, already during counselling and at the outset of in-patient therapy, a detailed treatment plan that takes into account the pertaining vocational and social integration considerations. Besides outlining some general ideas, the specific experience at the Orthopaedic Clinic of Frankfort university are described.",,W Heipertz;K D Thomann
