Practitioners can achieve this by adopting measures that reduce health care-associated infections among patients and occupational exposures among dental health care personnel. It is crucial for all dental practitioners to be up to date on current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, equipment, and techniques for proper infection control. Continuous evaluation of infection control practices is important. Patients and dental providers should be confident that oral health care can be delivered and received in a safe manner.",Blood-borne pathogens; Environmental infection control; Hand hygiene; Personal protective equipment; Sterilization and disinfection.,Francesco R Sebastiani;Harry Dym;Tarun Kirpalani

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10196487/,"Guideline for Prevention of Surgical Site Infection, 1999. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The ""Guideline for Prevention of Surgical Site Infection, 1999"" presents the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s recommendations for the prevention of surgical site infections (SSIs), formerly called surgical wound infections. This two-part guideline updates and replaces previous guidelines.1,2 Part I, ""Surgical Site Infection: An Overview,"" describes the epidemiology, definitions, microbiology, pathogenesis, and surveillance of SSIs. Included is a detailed discussion of the pre-, intra-, and postoperative issues relevant to SSI genesis. Part II, ""Recommendations for Prevention of Surgical Site Infection,"" represents the consensus of the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) regarding strategies for the prevention of SSIs.3 Whenever possible, the recommendations in Part II are based on data from well-designed scientific studies. However, there are a limited number of studies that clearly validate risk factors and prevention measures for SSI. By necessity, available studies have often been conducted in narrowly defined patient populations or for specific kinds of operations, making generalization of their findings to all specialties and types of operations potentially problematic. This is especially true regarding the implementation of SSI prevention measures. Finally, some of the infection control practices routinely used by surgical teams cannot be rigorously studied for ethical or logistical reasons (e.g., wearing vs not wearing gloves). Thus, some of the recommendations in Part II are based on a strong theoretical rationale and suggestive evidence in the absence of confirmatory scientific knowledge.It has been estimated that approximately 75% of all operations in the United States will be performed in ""ambulatory,"" ""same-day,"" or ""outpatient"" operating rooms by the turn of the century.4 In recommending various SSI prevention methods, this document makes no distinction between surgical care delivered in such settings and that provided in conventional inpatient operating rooms. This document is primarily intended for use by surgeons, operating room nurses, postoperative inpatient and clinic nurses, infection control professionals, anesthesiologists, healthcare epidemiologists, and other personnel directly responsible for the prevention of nosocomial infections. This document does not: Specifically address issues unique to burns, trauma, transplant procedures, or transmission of bloodborne pathogens from healthcare worker to patient, nor does it specifically address details of SSI prevention in pediatric surgical practice. It has been recently shown in a multicenter study of pediatric surgical patients that characteristics related to the operations are more important than those related to the physiologic status of the patients.5 In general, all SSI prevention measures effective in adult surgical care are indicated in pediatric surgical care. Specifically address procedures performed outside of the operating room (e.g., endoscopic procedures), nor does it provide guidance for infection prevention for invasive procedures such as cardiac catheterization or interventional radiology. Nonetheless, it is likely that many SSI prevention strategies also could be applied or adapted to reduce infectious complications associated with these procedures. Specifically recommend SSI prevention methods unique to minimally invasive operations (i.e., laparoscopic surgery). Available SSI surveillance data indicate that laparoscopic operations generally have a lower or comparable SSI risk when contrasted to open operations.6-11 SSI prevention measures applicable in open operations (e.g., open cholecystectomy) are indicated for their laparoscopic counterparts (e.g., laparoscopic cholecystectomy). Recommend specific antiseptic agents for patient preoperative skin preparations or for healthcare worker hand/forearm antisepsis. Hospitals should choose from products recommended for these activitie",,A J Mangram;T C Horan;M L Pearson;L C Silver;W R Jarvis

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8641531/,Infection control,"From an infectious disease point of view, dentistry has never been safer than it is today for both patients and the dental team. This state of affairs has resulted from the establishment and practice of strict infection control in the office using the concept of universal precautions. Infection control consists of a series of procedures directed at reducing the number of microbes shared among people. An approach to the management of infection control involves identification of an office safety coordinator and total involvement of everyone in the office. The procedures of infection control can be grouped into six major areas. 1. Handwashing and gloving provides protection to both patients and the dental team. 2. Protection against aerosols and spatter involves the use of a preprocedure mouthrinse, HVE, rubber dam, saliva ejection, mask, protective eyewear, and protective clothing. 3. Instrument processing provides instruments that are safe for patient use. 4. Surface asepsis eliminates the involvement of environmental surfaces in the spread of disease agents. 5. Management of sharps and other regulated waste reduces the chances for sharps injuries and contact with potentially infectious material. 6. Aseptic techniques include aseptic retrieval of supplies, reducing contamination from dental unit water, aseptic radiographic procedures, proper use of disposables, and preventing contamination of the dental laboratory.",,C H Miller
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20077771/,[Infection control in hospitals],"Infection control committee as the central decision-making and infection control team (ICT) for carrying out all aspects of infection control are important for hospital infection control. Standard precautions are used for all patients and apply to all body fluids except for sweat, whether or not they contain visible blood. Transmission-based precautions involve airborne, droplet, contact vector-borne and common vehicle precautions. Airborne precautions are for tuberculosis, varicella and measles. Small particles (< 5 microm) can be dispersed widely by air currents. Droplet precautions are for influenza, rubella, pertussis, and so on. Transmission via large droplet (< 5 microm) requires close contact within 1 to 2 m. Contact transmissions are for blood-borne pathogens, such as hepatitis B and C virus and HIV, bacterial infections via percutaneous and mucocutaneous exposure, and so on. Vaccinations for measles, rubella, varicella, mumps, influenza and hepatitis B virus to health-care workers are important. Influenza virus is mainly transmitted via droplet and contact, but also via airborne transmission in the aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation and suctioning. WHO declared a public health emergency in April 2009. A novel influenza has spread rapidly across the globe, and it will be necessary to prepare for the outbreak in this autumn and winter.",,Takeyuki Sato

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18156087/,Infection control in paediatrics,"Infection control has a particularly important role in paediatric hospitals and must take into account the specificity of the needs and environment of the paediatric patient. Children are susceptible to infections that are prevented in older patients by vaccination or previous natural exposure. Consequently, the nosocomial pathogens and most common health-care-associated infection sites in children differ from those observed among adults. The immunological naivety of young children, especially neonates, translates into an enhanced susceptibility to many infections with important health consequences as well as higher rates and longer duration of microorganism shedding. In particular, respiratory virus infections, rotavirus, varicella zoster virus, and pertussis represent persistent challenges in children's hospitals. Specific factors such as the use of breastmilk, toys, or therapy animals are associated with an increased risk for health-care-associated infections. We review the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant organisms and strategies to prevent health-care-associated infections in the paediatric setting.",,Klara M Posfay-Barbe;Danielle M Zerr;Didier Pittet

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11852419/,Infection control in Saudi Arabia: meeting the challenge,"Hospital-acquired infection poses significant clinical and economic burden worldwide. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, infection control is a young, rapidly growing specialty. An infrastructure to expedite the growth of this important discipline is fast being established. The kingdom faces unique challenges when addressing infection control, which are the subject of this review. Much of the policy-making in domestic infection control is driven by the preventive medicine concerns of the annual pilgrimage (Hajj) to Mecca, which are unparalleled. The Saudi Ministry of Health acts to contain and control public health risks at this gathering of 2 million. Infectious hazards at the Hajj include meningococcal meningitis, respiratory tract infections, bloodborne diseases, and zoonotic diseases, all of which have international ramifications as pilgrimaging Muslims return home. In the wake of the extraordinary pace of modernization in Saudi Arabia, deficiencies in infection control remain, which are slowly being redressed. This review examines the anatomy of infection control and its evolution in the kingdom. Future goals and infection control policy-making are given particular emphasis. Saudi Arabia seeks increasing international partnership in the area of infection control and preventive medicine. The Saudi health care system was formed on the basis of Western models to resounding success. Saudi Arabia is now in a position to provide experience and knowledge in return. International dialogue in the infection control arena is of mutual value. Important public health progress is afoot in this young kingdom, and these advances translate both regionally and on the international platform.",,Ziad A Memish

Infection control embraces not only developing policies for preventing the physical spread of a micro-organism but also prophylactic therapy such as vaccination and therapeutic measures such as antibiotics. Infection control not only applies to localized infection in hospital due to antibiotic resistant microbes but also to the community.

The aim of this systematic review was to critically review published reports that documented current IC practices and evaluated interventions to improve IC practices. A systematic literature search using ten databases to identify papers published over a 20-year period (February 1996 to February 2016) was conducted for studies that met the inclusion criteria. Included studies were assessed using the PRISMA and STROBE-Vet statements. A total of 14 of 1,615 identified studies met our inclusion criteria. Infection control practices included hand hygiene, sharps handling, environmental cleaning, personal protective equipment and personnel vaccination. Descriptive studies were the predominant research design for assessing IC compliance. Only three studies were interventions. Compliance with IC protocols was poor and only marginally increased with multimodal educational campaigns. There was significant variation in the implementation of IC by veterinary staff. Workplaces that had IC policies, management support and a staff member supporting their implementation were more likely to embrace good IC. Infection control data in veterinary practices were inconsistently reported and collected.

For years, the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) has provided advice and guidance to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on how best to prevent infections. These recommendations have focused largely on health care delivery practices and occasionally on general categories of products. With an influx of novel infection control products and growing use of these products by frontline clinicians, an efficient process for developing transparent, rigorous product recommendations that includes myriad data sources was necessary. To address this gap, the CDC asked HICPAC to develop a process that would help inform committees considering product-related recommendations. This article describes the process to develop this approach and provides an outline of how the tool may be used when products with infection control claims are recommended in guidelines or recommendations for infection prevention.",,Vineet Chopra;Lynn Janssen;Kristina Bryant;Loretta Fauerbach;Thomas R Talbot 3rd;Hillary M Babcock

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15760439/,Models for the organisation of hospital infection control and prevention programmes,"Hospital infection control is an essential part of infectious disease management and must be firmly structured and professionally organised. Prevention, limitation and eradication of nosocomial infections requires specific expertise not fully provided by clinical microbiologists and/or infectious disease consultants. Therefore, dedicated infection control physicians and nurses are essential. The basic components for successful hospital infection control include: (1) personnel and supporting resources proportional to size, complexity and estimated risk of the population served; (2) trained hospital infection control practitioners; and (3) the necessary structure to implement changes in medical, nursing and logistical organisation. The identification of areas of concern, provision of written policies and education still constitute the backbone of infection control. The infection control team must propose priorities and necessary resources, objectives, development methods, implementation and follow-up. The strategic approach must be discussed and approved by the infection control committee, comprising the hospital administrator(s), medical and nursing directors, a microbiologist, a hospital pharmacist and a delegation of clinicians. Follow-up of the projects is regularly presented to the committee by the infection control team. To what extent may evolution in the organisation of hospital infection control contribute to the optimisation of allocated resources and fulfillment of these objectives? From the Belgian experience, we conclude that structural changes represent an essential incentive. The impact of changes is greater when they are directed by the national authorities, providing resources and imposing new standards. Recommendations for staffing must consider not only the number of beds but also the objectives, complexity and characteristics of the patient population.",,B Gordts

We aim to develop a consensus recommendation for infection control during clinical management and invasive procedures in such patients. After an extensive literature review, draft recommendations were amended jointly by 27 partners from 15 European countries. Recommendations include repetitive training of staff to ascertain infection control, systematic use of cough and respiratory etiquette at admission to the emergency department, fluid sampling in the isolation room, and analyses in biosafety level 3/4 laboratories, and preference for point-of-care bedside laboratory tests. Children should be cared for by paediatricians and intensive-care patients should be cared for by critical-care doctors in high-level isolation units (HLIU). Invasive procedures should be avoided if unnecessary or done in the HLIU, as should chest radiography, ultrasonography, and renal dialysis. Procedures that require transport of patients out of the HLIU should be done during designated sessions or hours in secure transport. Picture archiving and communication systems should be used.

The infection control team in hospitals are given responsibilities to implement plans to deal with an event if one should occur. Many healthcare facilities belonging to primary care Trusts and particularly hospitals have been ordered to release a pandemic influenza policy. It is a policy that states the clinical features attributable to avian influenza, its possible transmission and information on general infection control precautions. It is necessary for hospitals to be prepared in its management for a potential influenza outbreak and have the necessary resources to execute infection control practices. This article outlines the infection control precautions that need to be implemented in hospitals in the event of pandemic influenza, and the various practices to adopt when coming into contact with patients with signs and symptoms of influenza.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18329137/,Infection control as a major World Health Organization priority for developing countries,"Healthcare-associated infection affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide and is a major global issue for patient safety. It complicates between 5 and 10% of admissions in acute care hospitals in industrialised countries. In developing countries, the risk is two to twenty times higher and the proportion of infected patients frequently exceeds 25%. A growing awareness of this problem prompted the World Health Organization to promote the creation of the World Alliance for Patient Safety. Prevention of healthcare-associated infection is the target of the Alliance First Global Patient Safety Challenge, 'Clean Care is Safer Care', launched in October 2005. After 2 years, a formal statement has been signed by 72 ministries of health as a pledge of their support to implement actions to reduce healthcare-associated infection; of these, 30 are developing countries. Additional countries, mostly from the developing world, have planned to sign by the end of 2008 and will represent in total more than three-quarters of the world's population. Given the emphasis of the proposed strategy on simple and affordable solutions, the impact of the Challenge is expected to be high in developing countries. The combined efforts expected under the Challenge have the potential to save millions of lives, prevent morbidities and long-term disability for hundreds of millions of patients, and lead to major cost savings through the improvement of basic infection control measures in any healthcare setting, regardless of resources available or level of development.",,D Pittet;B Allegranzi;J Storr;S Bagheri Nejad;G Dziekan;A Leotsakos;L Donaldson

This unfortunately does not seem to be the case in South African oral health care facilities. This study is a systematic review of available literature on the adherence of South African oral health care professionals to infection control recommendations. Nine focus areas were investigated with regard to infection control practices: knowledge of infectious occupational hazards; personal hygiene and care of hands; correct application of personal protective equipment; use of environmental barriers and disposable items; sterilisation (recirculation) of instruments and handpieces; disinfection (surfaces) and sound housekeeping; management of waste disposal; quality control of dental unit waterlines, biofilms and water; as well as other special considerations. Although South African studies are limited and most of them relied on self-reports, which could have resulted in a serious overestimation of compliance, even these studies indicate serious shortcomings with regard to infection control practices in oral health care facilities in this country. This review highlights opportunity for improvement. Furthermore, it identifies possibilities for future research in infection control and also opportunities to improve infection control education for all oral health care workers in the country.",,J Oosthuysen;E Potgieter;E Blignaut

The objectives of this study were to provide a baseline assessment of (1) NH facility and infection control program characteristics associated with having an infection control deficiency citation and (2) associations between IP training and the presence of antibiotic stewardship policies, controlling for NH characteristics. A cross-sectional survey of 2514 randomly sampled US NHs was conducted to assess IP training, staff turnover, and infection control program characteristics (ie, frequency of infection control committee meetings and the presence of 7 antibiotic stewardship policies). Responses were linked to concurrent Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Reporting data, which contain information about NH facility characteristics and citations. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression analyses were conducted to account for NH characteristics. Surveys were received from 990 NHs; 922 had complete data. One-third of NHs in this sample received an infection control deficiency citation. The NHs that received deficiency citations were more likely to have committees that met weekly/monthly versus quarterly ( P < .01). The IPs in 39% of facilities had received specialized training. Less than 3% of trained IPs were certified in infection control. The NHs with trained IPs were more likely to have 5 of the 7 components of antibiotic stewardship in place (all P < .05). The IP training, although infrequent, was associated with the presence of antibiotic stewardship policies. Receiving an infection control citation was associated with more frequent infection control committee meetings. Training and support of IPs is needed to ensure infection control and antibiotic stewardship in NHs. As the CMS rule becomes implemented, more research is warranted. There is a need for increase in trained IPs in US NHs. These data can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the CMS final rule on infection management processes in US NHs.",antibiotic stewardship; infection control; infection prevention; nursing homes; quality improvement.,Patricia W Stone;Carolyn T A Herzig;Mansi Agarwal;Monika Pogorzelska-Maziarz;Andrew W Dick

In the late nineteenth century came huge breakthroughs in the understanding that microorganisms cause many disorders, and methods to eliminate and control these microorganisms were attempted. By 1910, sterile instruments, gowns, masks, and gloves had become standard for surgical procedures in large university human hospitals, and isolation of human and veterinary patients with contagious diseases became standard. With the advent of vaccines, many epidemic viral diseases could be controlled, and antimicrobial drugs allowed many previously devastating bacterial diseases to be treated effectively. Before long, however, bacterial resistance became an important issue and remains so today, particularly for Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus in horses. Vaccination has decreased the number of animals susceptible to equine influenza and equine herpesvirus 1, yet these contagious diseases still pose a serious issue in large equine veterinary hospitals. The development of equine isolation facilities and improved methods of barn cleaning; mandatory application of procedures, such as handwashing or use of disinfectant hand wipes, to prevent the spread of infectious diseases; and monitoring of antimicrobial resistance and use of restricted antimicrobial drugs were driven by recognition and necessity and have given rise to current equine infection control programs.",,Bradford P Smith

Despite considerable progress in the development of infection control programmes in some countries with limited resources, programmes in most developing world settings are non-existent, or are not implemented. Kosova, the poorest country in Europe, illustrates the challenges posed by infection control in the developing world. In many hospitals activities are limited by the lack of financial resources, poor infrastructure, overcrowding, inadequate hygiene, poorly functioning laboratory services, poor management, insufficient technology and a shortage of trained staff. Infection control guidelines from developed countries are often perceived as a standard for the developing world, but have to be modified to take into account differences in local needs. The best solutions entail greater governmental commitment and application of infection control procedures consistent with available resources.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25278571/,Controlling hospital-acquired infection: focus on the role of the environment and new technologies for decontamination,"There is increasing interest in the role of cleaning for managing hospital-acquired infections (HAI). Pathogens such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multiresistant Gram-negative bacilli, norovirus, and Clostridium difficile persist in the health care environment for days. Both detergent- and disinfectant-based cleaning can help control these pathogens, although difficulties with measuring cleanliness have compromised the quality of published evidence. Traditional cleaning methods are notoriously inefficient for decontamination, and new approaches have been proposed, including disinfectants, steam, automated dispersal systems, and antimicrobial surfaces. These methods are difficult to evaluate for cost-effectiveness because environmental data are not usually modeled against patient outcome. Recent studies have reported the value of physically removing soil using detergent, compared with more expensive (and toxic) disinfectants. Simple cleaning methods should be evaluated against nonmanual disinfection using standardized sampling and surveillance. Given worldwide concern over escalating antimicrobial resistance, it is clear that more studies on health care decontamination are required. Cleaning schedules should be adapted to reflect clinical risk, location, type of site, and hand touch frequency and should be evaluated for cost versus benefit for both routine and outbreak situations. Forthcoming evidence on the role of antimicrobial surfaces could supplement infection prevention strategies for health care environments, including those targeting multidrug-resistant pathogens.",,Stephanie J Dancer

Data were analyzed using word frequencies, and results are displayed in word clouds. RESULTS For 2015, our search identified 6 news websites with a total of published 116 articles, 71 articles from selected newspapers, and 214 publications from infection control websites. In total, 1,059 journal articles were initially identified; 98 articles were anonymous and thus were excluded, leaving 961 articles in the reviews. The terms 'superbug' and 'antibiotics' were most commonly used in titles of news websites and newspapers, whereas the terms 'infection' and 'prevention' were most commonly used in infection control websites or blogs. The word frequency differences among the 4 selected journals reflected their respective specialties. CONCLUSION In infection prevention and control, the integration of a range of mediums is necessary to best serve public interests.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30376377/,"2018 AAHA Infection Control, Prevention, and Biosecurity Guidelines","A veterinary team's best work can be undone by a breach in infection control, prevention, and biosecurity (ICPB). Such a breach, in the practice or home-care setting, can lead to medical, social, and financial impacts on patients, clients, and staff, as well as damage the reputation of the hospital. To mitigate these negative outcomes, the AAHA ICPB Guidelines Task Force believes that hospital teams should improve upon their current efforts by limiting pathogen exposure from entering or being transmitted throughout the hospital population and using surveillance methods to detect any new entry of a pathogen into the practice. To support these recommendations, these practice-oriented guidelines include step-by-step instructions to upgrade ICPB efforts in any hospital, including recommendations on the following: establishing an infection control practitioner to coordinate and implement the ICPB program; developing evidence-based standard operating procedures related to tasks performed frequently by the veterinary team (hand hygiene, cleaning and disinfection, phone triage, etc.); assessing the facility's ICPB strengths and areas of improvement; creating a staff education and training plan; cataloging client education material specific for use in the practice; implementing a surveillance program; and maintaining a compliance evaluation program. Practices with few or no ICPB protocols should be encouraged to take small steps.

The recommendations fall into 5 categories: managing critical data and information; developing and recommending policies and procedures; intervening directly to prevent infections; educating and training of health care workers, patients, and nonmedical caregivers; and resources. The Consensus Panel used an evidence-based approach and categorized recommendations according to modifications of the scheme developed by the Clinical Affairs Committee of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee.",,C Friedman;M Barnette;A S Buck;R Ham;J A Harris;P Hoffman;D Johnson;F Manian;L Nicolle;M L Pearson;T M Perl;S L Solomon

These data reflect a 145% increase in infection control activities over a 20-year period. However, resources for infection control and prevention have not kept pace with this increased activity. In addition, the current trend toward mandatory reporting of health care-associated infections (HAIs) among several states will add more tasks for ICPs with limited resources, at the risk of spending less time on prevention and control activities.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8138317/,Rules of infection control,"The subject of infection control in dentistry has aroused much controversy and debate during the past decade as a result of the global spread of the human immunodeficiency virus infection. Consequently a number of regulatory bodies have promulgated guidelines for infection control in dentistry and the current consensus is that the 'universal infection control' policy--which considers every patient as infectious--should be the norm in every dental practice. The reasons for this are the asymptomatic carriage of pathogens due to the sub-clinical nature, the prodromal period and the carrier state associated with a number of diseases. The universal infection control rules should encompass six elements: routine patient evaluation, personal protection with barrier techniques, instrument sterilisation including sterilisation control, surface and equipment disinfection, asepsis in the laboratory and appropriate disposal of contaminated waste including sharps. Finally, practitioners should attempt to keep abreast of the rules and regulations related to the subject of infection control in dentistry which are continuously evolving due to the steadily increasing data pool on infectious diseases and their modes of prevention.",,L Samaranayake

The real understanding of hospital infection followed upon the discoveries of Pasteur, Koch and Lister and the beginning of the 'Bacteriological Era'. The close of the 19th century saw the triumphs of hospital reform and asepsis and seemed to herald the final victory over hospital cross-infection. However, the victory was short-lived. It was soon realised that infections occurred not only in obstetric and surgical patients, but in medical patients as well, and that air could also be a source of infection. Streptococcal, staphylococcal and then Gram-negative bacilli as a cause of hospital infection became a focus of attention, as did antibiotic-resistant organisms.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11944003/,From expert data collectors to interventionists: changing the focus for infection control professionals,"The current economic and political environments challenge health care organizations in the United States to provide affordable, accessible, and comprehensive health services. However, changes in reimbursement to health care providers can affect their ability to offer access to cutting-edge services while reducing costs. Consequently, organizations are restructuring, re-engineering, right-sizing, downsizing, and redesigning, all in an effort to save money while also hoping to maintain a reputation for quality and customer service. Dr Vicky Fraser, in her keynote address at the APIC conference in 2000, reminded us that ICHE programs are cost centers rather than revenue generators, and are often targets for budget cuts. Although Haley's Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control (SENIC), published in 1985, was a landmark event demonstrating the importance of our profession's mission, it is becoming dated. Infection control professionals (ICPs) must continue Haley's work, finding innovative ways to market or demonstrate the value of ICHE programs to health care executives. Closing the 1999 APIC conference with a symposium entitled ""Breaking Out of the Box,"" Jackson and Massanari challenged ICPs to educate themselves about the changing health care environment, to be proactive, and constructively help organizations ""re-engineer"" more efficiently, rather than feel victimized and helplessly await being re-engineered out of existence. The threat of downsizing prompted ICPs at BJC HealthCare to realize that the time had come to change their own culture and attitudes and to focus on the business of infection control. This change required challenging the traditional roles of solo practitioner, data collector, and keeper of infection control data and knowledge. The goals now include leading intervention teams committed to reducing health care-associated infections, partnering rather than accepting sole responsibility for lowering infection rates, and learning to influence without authority. Staying focused on quality and cost-effectiveness and demonstrating improvements in clinical outcomes became a commitment.

In Australia, border screening to identify travellers returning from EVD-affected west African countries during the 2014-2015 outbreak has made it unlikely that specimens from patients with unrecognised EVD would be sent to a routine diagnostic laboratory. Australian public health and diagnostic laboratories associated with hospitals designated for the care of patients with EVD have developed stringent safety precautions for EVD diagnostic and other tests likely to be required for supportive care of the sickest (and most infectious) patients with EVD, including as wide a range of point-of-care tests as possible. However, it is important that the stringent requirements for packaging, transport and testing of specimens that might contain Ebolavirus--which is a tier 1 security sensitive biology agent--do not delay the diagnosis and appropriate management of other potentially serious but treatable infectious diseases, which are far more likely causes of a febrile illness in people returning from west Africa. If necessary, urgent haematology, biochemistry and microbiological tests can be performed safely, whilst awaiting the results of EVD tests, in a PC-2 laboratory with appropriate precautions including: use of recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) for laboratory staff; handling any unsealed specimens in a class 1 or II biosafety cabinet; using only centrifuges with sealed rotors; and safe disposal or decontamination of all used equipment and laboratory waste.",,G L Gilbert

Questionnaires were mailed to a stratified random sample of 6,444 dentists, of whom 66.4% responded. Weighted analyses included Pearson's chi-square test and multiple logistic regression. Significant provincial and territorial differences included testing for immune response after hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination, HBV vaccination for all clinical staff, use of infection control manuals and post-exposure protocols, biological monitoring of heat sterilizers, handwashing before treating patients, using gloves and changing them after each patient, heat-sterilizing handpieces between patients, and using masks and uniforms to protect against splatter of blood and saliva. Excellent compliance (compliance with a combination of 18 recommended infection control procedures) ranged from 0% to 10%; the best predictors were more hours of continuing education on infection control in the last two years, practice location in larger cities (> 500,000) and sex (female).

Whether to implement this strategy to routinely screen and isolate inpatients with MRSA in non-outbreak (endemic) settings, or to remove it and use standard infection control precautions only is scientifically and ethically controversial, in view of the potential adverse effects of contact precautions on patients. To support the use of standard precautions only, it has been argued that active surveillance to identify patients who are asymptomatically colonised with MRSA to place them in contact precautions is unjust or unfair to these patients in various ways. This paper will unpack and examine four distinct arguments, which are advanced from a medical ethics or quality improvement ethical framework, for why this is so. Our analysis shows that while these arguments highlight the injustice of current practices, they do not provide strong ethical reasons for justifying the removal of active surveillance and contact precautions to control MRSA transmission and infection. An implication of our arguments is that the ethical frame for evaluating prevention and control strategies for MRSA, a multi-drug resistant bacteria, should shift from healthcare to primarily public health. From a public health ethics perspective, whether a strategy is unjust, or how ethically significant its lack of fairness is, depends on assessing the evidence for its public health effectiveness and necessity in a given setting, and the extent of the harms and burdens patients with MRSA bear when they are on contact precautions, which remain matters of scientific debate or uncertainty. As an ethical consideration in the debate, the chief normative implication of justice is to provide us further reasons to revise current active surveillance-contact precautions practices, and for the need for research and interventions to minimise their potential adverse effects on patients.",Active surveillance; Antibiotic resistance; Asymptomatic carriers; Contact precautions; Ethics; Infection control; Justice; MRSA; Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Public health.,Teck Chuan Voo;Zohar Lederman

These, in turn, are due largely to decreases in cigarette smoking as well as earlier and more aggressive diagnoses and treatments. These advances in health care delivery are, not surprisingly, accompanied by increasing numbers of complicating health care-associated infections (HAI). HAIs are a major and increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in the US as well as around the world. To win both the battles and the war against HAI requires a multidisciplinary approach to the vigorous implementation and maintenance of proper infection control procedures. This should include continuous surveillance and reinforcement of guidelines to enhance evidence-based practices to prevent and control HAI. It will also be necessary to implement a new paradigm of early and formal education of future health care providers into the biology of infection as well as the principles of infection control in the classroom and subsequently, with translation into their clinical training.

The top-three diseases of concern to shelters were feline upper respiratory disease (FURD), canine parvovirus and ringworm. Concern over these diseases was greater in open-admission shelters (compared to limited admission or no-kill/sanctuary) (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.1-12.5) and in shelters with a desire for more zoonotic-disease training (OR=6.1, 95% CI 1.5-24.8) (compared to shelters desiring infectious-disease training, training on cleaning and disinfection or those who have no need for further training). In 45% of responding shelters many to most animals arrive with infectious diseases. Written protocols for preventive medicine exist in 88% of shelters, cleaning and disinfection protocols in 75%, specific disease protocols for outbreak situations in 36% and infection-control manuals in 15%. Veterinarians are in charge of infection-control in 6% of shelters. Approximately 45% of shelters vaccinate dogs and cats for rabies. Infectious-disease training is provided to 30% of staff and 35% of volunteers upon hire. Overall, volunteers received less training in infectious- and zoonotic-disease identification, prevention and control than staff members. Ninety percent of shelters said they would benefit from training in infectious and zoonotic disease. Results from this study can be used to assess and address needs in animal shelters relating to infection-control, infectious and zoonotic-disease awareness and can help guide development of shelter staff and volunteer training.",,Kay K Steneroden;Ashley E Hill;M D Salman

A particular public health, economic, and political concern is the role of air travel in bringing infectious passengers or vectors to previously non-endemic areas. Yet, little research has been done to investigate either the infection risks associated with air travel or the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of infection control measures on aircraft and at borders. We briefly review the interface between international and national legislation, policy, and guidelines in the context of existing infection risks and possible scenarios. We have found that public health guidance and legislation, which airlines are required to follow, are often contradictory and confusing. Infection control measures for air travel need to be underpinned by coherent and enforceable national and international legislation that is based on solid epidemiological evidence. We recommend further research investment into more effective on-board vector control, health screening, and risk communications strategies, and the development of enforceable and harmonised international legislation.",,Andrea Grout;Natasha Howard;Richard Coker;Elizabeth M Speakman

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Thirty-four hemodialysis facilities were randomly selected from among 772 facilities in 4 end-stage renal disease participating networks. Facility selection was stratified on dialysis organization affiliation, size, socioeconomic status, and urban/rural status. MEASUREMENTS Trained infection control evaluators used an infection control worksheet to observe 73 distinct infection control practices at the hemodialysis facilities, from October 1, 2011, through January 31, 2012. RESULTS There was considerable variation in infection control practices across enrolled facilities. Overall adherence to recommended practices was 68% (range, 45%-92%) across all facilities. Overall adherence to expected hand hygiene practice was 72% (range, 10%-100%). Compliance to hand hygiene before and after procedures was high; however, during procedures hand hygiene compliance averaged 58%. Use of chlorhexidine as the specific agent for exit site care was 19% overall but varied from 0% to 35% by facility type. The 8 checklists varied in the frequency of perfect performance from 0% for meeting every item on the checklist for disinfection practices to 22% on the arteriovenous access practices at initiation. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that there are many areas for improvement in hand hygiene and other infection prevention practices in end-stage renal disease.

Infection control nurses in each of the study districts have different approaches to training with only Stafford using a link nurse system. Our additional aim therefore was to examine the relationship between the knowledge base of nursing staff and their ward audit score, and to determine whether wards with link nurses achieved significantly higher scores. To establish this a questionnaire was devised and completed by three different grades of staff on each ward at the time of the audit. These results were fed back to the wards and to managers by the infection control nurse, and an action plan given with a review date where applicable. Results of the study indicated that the audit tool could be used effectively in any district but would need modifying for psychiatric departments.

The UK has an HCAI prevalence rate of 8.2% which equates to an annual incidence of approximately 300000 patients (Hospital Infection Society, 2007). HCAI is a safety issue because it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality as well as increased healthcare costs (National Audit Office (NAO), 2009). In 2000, the NAO identified cultural change as a requirement if the NHS is to get a grip of infection prevention and control. This article has taken a 'conceptual culture of safety model' that has been previously described in the literature and applied it to the organization of infection control.

Findings were used to generate a framework of understanding which in turn helped inform a baseline approach for future research and design development. The study revealed that a lack of clarity between infection transmission zones and a lack of design attributes needed to uphold infection prevention measures may be undermining healthcare workers' understanding and application of good practice. The issue may be further complicated by well-intentioned behavioural attitudes to meeting work objectives; undue influences from spatial constraints; the influence of inadvertent and excessive touch-based interactions; physical and/or cognitive exertion to maintain transmission barriers; and the impact of expanding job design and increased workload to supplement for lack of effective barriers.

ICT was consisted of five infection control doctors (ICD), two infection control nurses (ICN), two medical technicians in bacteriological division of clinical laboratory, one pharmacist and three administrative officials in the hospital. Monitoring of multiple drug-resistant pathogens, antibiotic use, surgical site infections and bloodstream infections are mandatory. Personnel training and educational activity are also required. After the establishment of ICT, inappropriate use of antibiotics and prevalence of MRSA were dramatically decreased. The hospital saved more than 30,000,000 yen annually. However, with a great regret, we experienced an outbreak of MRSA in a department of our hospital in 2003. MRSA infection was judged as a cause of death in three patients in the outbreak. MRSA was thought to transmit via medical personnel since pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed common genotype in 11 out of 15 patients studied.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12066030/,Wound colonization and infection: the role of topical antimicrobials,"Infection and bacterial colonization are important factors in compromised wound healing, particularly in chronic wounds. The current ""best practice"" for controlling these factors is still unclear. Systemic antibiotics are generally accepted as being the preferred choice for treating infection, provided that ischaemia does not interfere. However, their widespread systemic and topical use is leading to the emergence of resistant bacterial strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Colonization of wounds presents a double problem: possible delayed healing if out of balance with the immune system; and as a source for cross-infection. Managing colonization is not yet defined in best practice. The judicious use of dressings, notably those containing certain antiseptic agents, can be valuable in infection control and in promoting healing. This review states the case for taking the antiseptic route as part of the concerted approach to local wound management and infection control.",,R J White;R Cooper;A Kingsley

These specialists are distributed among tertiary general hospitals, while many small and mid-scale hospitals have no infection control specialists. In 2012, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare launched a new strategy for further improvement of infection control by supporting a regional network of infection control activities. Through the infection control network, small or mid-scaled hospitals can utilize infection control specialists in tertiary general hospitals, enter educational programs on infection control and consult in cases of nosocomial infection outbreaks. As part of the regional infection control network, we established an information network system, named ReNICS, to share the bacteriological test results of the hospitals in Akita prefecture. ReNICS offers epidemiological data on bacteria identified in the region. We can identify the spread of multi-drug resistant bacteria and can roughly estimate the quality of infection control activities in each facility.

However, badly designed and/or incorrectly operating isolation rooms have been shown to place healthcare workers and other patients at risk from airborne diseases such as tuberculosis. Few standards are available for the design of isolation rooms and no pressure differential or air-change rates are specified. Techniques such as aerosol particle tracer sampling and computational fluid dynamics can be applied to study the performance of negative-pressure rooms and to assess how design variables can affect their performance.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18044383/,Single-use device reuse risks,"Efforts to reduce both costs and medical waste have led many health systems to start reusing single-use medical devices (SUDs) after cleaning and sterilizing (i.e. reprocessing). There is a currently a wide range of SUD types being reused in many health systems. The objective of this paper is to provide a brief summary of risk issues associated with critical SUDs, based on a rapid review of the available literature. The specific focus is on risk issues, but includes discussion of economic and legal/ethical issues as well. The evidence in the literature regarding the safety of reuse of SUDs indicates that for certain devices (e.g. heart catheters) reuse can be safe (in terms of patient infection) and cost-effective as long as stringent reprocessing protocols are followed. However, potential risks associated with reusing SUDs are not just limited to infection of patients. There are staff and environmental risks, plus important legal, ethical, and financial issues to consider in a reuse policy. There are currently no Canadian guidelines on reuse or reprocessing SUDs, although a national Scientific Advisory Panel on Reprocessing of Medical Devices has made recommendations. Additionally, reuse of SUDs is interwoven with the issue of infection control and reprocessing procedures in general and as applied to multiple-use devices. With limited healthcare resources, there will always be a trade-off between the human resources and costs required to clean and sterilize reused devices with costs associated with purchasing and disposing of non-reused SUDs. Evaluation of complete operational pathways, especially for more expensive and commonly used SUDs, will be useful to properly determine the balance of benefits, risks, and costs under a reuse policy.",,Robert C Lee;Sandy Berzins;Nancy Alfieri

Although Japan was spared from the 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), hospitals were placed on high alert. The actual preparedness level of hospitals can be determined by examining individual perceptions among the hospital healthcare workers (HCWs). The objective of this study was to assess the level of preparedness of emergency infection control measures in Japan and to quantify the differences in preparedness across institutions and disciplines. From July to September 2003, a questionnaire survey concerning the perceptions of risks and countermeasures and knowledge about SARS was distributed at seven tertiary hospitals. Disciplines were categorized as emergency room (ER)/intensive care unit (ICU), surgical, medical, and ""others"". Of the 9978 questionnaires administered, 6929 valid responses were received and analyzed. After adjusting for age, sex, and job category, specific institutional measures (I-scores) were found to be more indicative of the level of preparedness across institutions and disciplines than were measures of overall effectiveness (E-scores) or knowledge of preventive measures (K-scores). In particular, the difference in I-scores was much more substantial across institutions than across disciplines. Across disciplines, surgical ranked lower than ER/ICU or medical. In conclusion, substantial differences in emergency infection control measures, as perceived by HCWs, exists among hospitals in Japan, with the differences across institutions exceeding those across disciplines. To achieve a higher level of preparedness for infectious diseases, institutions should designate and implement effective emergency infection control measures.",,Teppei Imai;Ken Takahashi;Tsutomu Hoshuyama;Naoki Hasegawa;Sin Eng Chia;David Koh

The tasks of this team were to establish a China Ebola treatment unit (ETU), to commence the initial admission and treatment of suspected and confirmed Ebola patients, and to provide public health and infection control training for relevant local personnel. Overall, during the 2-month stay of this first medical assistance team in Liberia, 112 Ebola-suspected patients presented to the ETU, 65 patients were admitted, including 5 confirmed cases, and 3 confirmed cases were cured. Furthermore, 1520 local people were trained, including health care workers, military health care workers, staff members employed by the ETU, and community residents. Most importantly, as the first Chinese medical assistance team deployed to Liberia fighting the Ebola virus on the frontline, not a single member of this team or the hired local staff were infected by Ebola virus. This highly successful outcome was due to the meticulous infection control initiatives developed by the team, thereby making a significant contribution to China's ETU ""zero infection"" of health workers in Liberia.

The last two steps complete the audit cycle or 'close the loop'. Infection control can be audited for whether written guidelines exist for each procedure, whether these guidelines are acceptable and whether they are followed in practice. This form of audit is relatively simple provided there are authoritative model guidelines available, produced by organizations such as the Hospital Infection Society. The best outcome measure of infection control is the nosocomial infection rate, but this is the most difficult to audit in practice. If audit results are to be compared between hospitals or between different time periods in the same hospital, infection rates should be adjusted for the underlying risks of infection in the patient population. This type of audit can be done by repeated prevalence surveys.",,G L French

Infection control--a challenge in a land of contrasts,"The general level of health care in any country will dictate to a large extent the amount of attention paid to the control of nosocomial infections. In South Africa the apartheid era, although initially supporting a strong economy, did little to foster a good education system among the mass of the population. With the imposition of sanctions and the decline in the economy, the health services which had been curative in nature and centred around the medical schools of the country and their teaching hospitals, began to suffer the effects of rampant inflation and financial cutbacks. Nevertheless, virtually all the medical schools support infection control programmes of one sort or another. In addition, there are a number of Infection Control Societies in the country. With the present political instability and violence in the country, the health services have not escaped. Staff cutbacks are inevitable and wards may have to close; the academic hospitals are under threat. Privatization is strongly favoured by government. The present population of approximately 30 million could double by the year 2020, putting enormous pressure on limited resources. The squatter problem worsens every month. The spectre of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection increases yearly. Any assessment of priorities must therefore be made against this background. Only proven methods of infection control should be encouraged. In the light of the foregoing, three areas of practical activity are examined: the re-processing of heat-labile equipment, the re-use of disposables and the disposal of clinical waste.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,A A Forder
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12004552/,Infection-control basics. A common sense review for EMS personnel,"Infection-control principles and practices based on science and common sense have been around for thousands of years. They've proven effective. If you know how a disease is transmitted, then you'll know what PPE to use to block transmission. Viruses don't multiply or survive for long outside a living host, so they may be present on a given surface, but in low numbers--and most often not numbers large enough to cause infection. However, hepatitis B virus can survive up to seven days in the presence of dried blood; that's why contaminated equipment must be cleaned as soon as possible after use. If it's not possible to use PPE in a given situation or it fails, then post-exposure medical follow-up and treatment can protect you. Ensuring there's an effective communication network in place for reporting an exposure to your DO is essential. Your agency should verify that hospitals are aware of their responsibilities under the Ryan White Law to share patient testing information if an exposure event occurs. The DO's role includes working with hospitals to provide proper medical follow-up, rapid patient testing and counseling for the exposed provider. Your DO is your advocate. Each and every component of your department's exposure control plan assists in reducing the risk for acquiring an infection on the job. Risk reduction and risk management are both vital. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with you--the provider--to know infection-control principles and practice good habits.",,Katherine West

The concept of this guideline is to show the minimum precautions that urologists and other medical professionals should observe when they work in the urological field. Standard precautions based on hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment should be observed in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. In the inpatient setting, the management of the toilet is important. Collecting urine should be restricted only when it is necessary to determine a patient's urinary output. The management for urinary catheter and infection are created based on the ""European and Asian guidelines on management and prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections"". In addition, we propose that nephrostomy should be carried out after maximum barrier precautions have been taken. Urinary catheters are replaced in the event of an occlusion or if there are signs that an occlusion might occur, but the same catheter cannot be left in place for more than 2 months. Regarding the handling of urine containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis, airborne infection countermeasures are unnecessary, except for the laboratory personnel. For the procedures using urological endoscopes, aseptic techniques are recommended.

The setting was a single large perinatal centre over a seven-year period. Statistical tracking of NNI in exceedingly premature infants was by control charting methodology. A steady and statistically significant decline in NNI rates from 13 to seven episodes per 1000 bed-days (censored to day 35) for infants less than 29 weeks of gestation has been recorded. A multidisciplinary QIT has managed the implementation of measures designed to reduce NNI in the unit. These have included raising awareness of the need for asepsis, improved hand hygiene, increased vigilance in using central lines, monitoring blood culture collection techniques and improving the environment. We believe such measures in conjunction with the positive feedback obtained from charting have been responsible for the steady decline in NNI.

Standard precautions are applicable to all health professionals caring for any patients; additional barrier precautions (isolation) are recommended for patients carrying transmissible infectious diseases or MDR bacteria in sporadic or epidemic situations. Moreover, additional precautions may be required for populations at particular risk of infection or colonization by emerging XDR (eXDR), defined in our country as carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Our ability to detect and identify eXDR carriers early and ensure their follow-up, through effective communication between all those involved, is a significant challenge for controlling their spread. Thus, the French High Committee for Public Health has updated and standardized all French existing recommendations concerning the prevention of the cross-transmission of these bacteria, and these recommendations are summarized in this review. The recommendations are based on scientific and operational knowledge up to 2013. Different preventive strategies are recommended for patients found to be carrying eXDR and those who are considered to be at risk of having eXDR because of a history of contact. The local context, the experience of the infection control team, the different times at which detection of eXDR takes place (during admission, hospitalization, etc.) and the epidemiological situation (sporadic cases, clusters, outbreaks, widespread epidemic) must be included in risk assessments that in turn inform the control measures that should be applied in each clinical circumstance.",Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE); Extensively drug-resistant bacteria (XDR); Multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDR); Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).,D Lepelletier;P Berthelot;J-C Lucet;S Fournier;V Jarlier;B Grandbastien;National Working Group

New governmental plans for health care depend heavily on practice guidelines, and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) has been especially enthusiastic about continuous quality improvement. Monitoring the appropriateness of care and altering physician practice appeals to insurance carriers and health care management organizations. Some initial data exist to show that the quality of health care has been enhanced by these regulations. The total cost for health care administration in 1990 in the USA was 24.8% of each hospital's spending for health care. Much of this was associated with spending for new initiatives in practice guidelines, physician profiling, quality assurance, and the like. Few data exist to show that the quality of health care or hospital infection control has been enhanced by these expenditures. Regulations and guidelines also have proliferated in infection control. Guides from the JCAHO have been expanded, and recent mandates from the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) for protecting employees from blood-borne and respiratory pathogens promise to be especially costly for health care organizations to implement. Little data exist to show that the quality of infection control has been enhanced by these regulations. Standards are difficult to develop, because the science to back them up often is lacking, interpretation of validating data is imprecise, and inherent biological variation makes exceptions common. Seven lessons are important for those developing standards today. These include focusing on objective measures of the impact of the standard, clearly indicating the degree of scientific validity, making the development process inclusive, allowing for local variation, making sure that funding is provided for mandated standards, considering non-scientific implications of standards, and remaining involved in the process after the guideline is developed. Infection control workers should make sure that standards developed take the lessons above into account before they are promulgated.",,J E McGowan Jr

Despite multiple efforts, nephrologists have been unable to prevent infections in dialysis facilities. The American Society of Nephrology and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have partnered to create Nephrologists Transforming Dialysis Safety to promote nephrologist leadership and engagement in efforts to ""Target Zero"" preventable dialysis infections. Because traditional approaches to infection control and prevention in dialysis facilities have had limited success, Nephrologists Transforming Dialysis Safety is reconceptualizing the problem in the context of the complexity of health care systems and organizational behavior. By identifying different parts of a problem and attempting to understand how these parts interact and produce a result, systems thinking has effectively tackled difficult problems in dynamic settings. The dialysis facility is composed of different physical and human elements that are interconnected and affect not only behavior but also, the existence of a culture of safety that promotes infection prevention. Because dialysis infections result from a complex system of interactions between caregivers, patients, dialysis organizations, and the environment, attempts to address infections by focusing on one element in isolation often fail. Creating a sense of urgency and commitment to eradicating dialysis infections requires leadership and motivational skills. These skills are not taught in the standard nephrology or medical director curriculum. Effective leadership by medical directors and engagement in infection prevention by nephrologists are required to create a culture of safety. It is imperative that nephrologists commit to leadership training and embrace their potential as change agents to prevent infections in dialysis facilities.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10833336/,Management of hospital outbreaks of gastro-enteritis due to small roundstructured viruses,"Small round structured viruses (SRSVs, Norwalk-like viruses, NLVs) are the most common cause of outbreaks of gastro-enteritis in hospitals and also cause outbreaks in other settings such as schools, hotels, nursing homes and cruise ships. Hospital outbreaks often lead to ward closure and major disruption in hospital activity. Outbreaks usually affect both patients and staff, sometimes with attack rates in excess of 50%. For this reason, staff shortages can be severe, particularly if several wards are involved at the same time. SRSVs may be spread by several routes: faecal-oral; vomiting/aerosols; food and water. Viruses may be introduced into the ward environment by any of these routes and then propagated by person-to-person spread. In an outbreak setting, the diagnosis can usually be made rapidly and confidently on clinical and epidemiological grounds, particularly if vomiting is a prominent symptom. By the time an SRSV outbreak has been recognized at ward level, most susceptible individuals will have been exposed to the virus and infection control efforts must prioritize the prevention of spread of infection to other clinical areas bycontainment of infected/exposed individuals (especially the prevention of patient and staff movements to other areas), hand-hygiene and effective environmental decontamination. This report of the Public Health Laboratory Service Viral Gastro-enteritis Working Group reviews the epidemiology of outbreaks of infection due to SRSVs and makes recommendations for their management in the hospital setting.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22365926/,Characteristics of the THERAFLEX UV-Platelets pathogen inactivation system - an update,"Considerable progress has been made in the last decade in producing purer, safer, leucocyte and plasma reduced platelet concentrates (PC) with an extended shelf life. The development of different pathogen inactivation technologies (PIT) has made a substantial contribution to this trend. Preceding platelet PIT (INTERCEPT Blood System/Cerus Corporation, Concord, CA, USA; MIRASOL/Caridian BCT, Lakewood, CO, USA) are based on adding a photosensitive compound to PC. The mixture is then activated by UV light in the UVB and/or UVA spectral regions. A novel procedure, THERAFLEX UV-Platelets (MacoPharma, Mouvaux, France), was recently developed that uses short-wave ultraviolet light (UVC), without addition of any photoactive agent. This technology has proven to be highly effective in sterilising bacteria (the major cause of morbidity/mortality after platelet transfusion) as well as inactivating other transfusion transmitted DNA/RNA containing pathogens and residual leucocytes. Any PIT reflects a balance between the efficacy of pathogen inactivation and preservation of platelet quality and function. A broad spectrum of in vitro tests have become available for the assessment of platelet storage lesion (PSL), aiming to better predict clinical outcome and untoward effects of platelet therapy. Recent paired studies on the release of platelet-derived cytokines, as new platelet performance indicators, revealed a parallel increase in both THERAFLEX UV-treated and control PC throughout storage, supporting the notion that the bioavailability of platelet function is not grossly affected by UVC treatment. This is corroborated by some newer technologies for proteomic analysis, showing that the THERAFLEX UV-Platelets system results in limited disruption of integrin-regulating extracellular disulfide bonds and minimal protein alterations when compared to UVB and gamma irradiation. Moreover, standard in vitro parameters reflecting activation, metabolic activity and function of platelets are useful indicators of the overall performance of processing and storage and may be used as surrogate markers of platelet quality in vivo. However, there is some doubt as to what degree each marker alone or in combination reflects the true clinical outcome of transfused platelets. Therefore, an appropriate clinical programme has been initiated. The preclinical evaluation demonstrated tolerability and immunological safety of THERAFLEX UV-Platelets using an animal model. Additionally, the system has successfully completed two autologous Phase I trials on recovery and survival. Preliminary results suggest that the recovery and survival rates are consistent with other pathogen reduced platelet products that are licensed and in use. The method is currently under evaluation for safety and tolerability of UVC-treated platelets in healthy volunteers. Presently the THERAFLEX UV-Platelets system is the simplest and purest PIT easily adaptable to the existing blood bank setting. In the future, extension of the application range of the THERAFLEX UV-Platelets system is expected, in order to make this new technology compatible with a broad spectrum of collection and processing platforms, and with other blood products.",,Jerard Seghatchian;Frank Tolksdorf

Currently, facility engineers and designers of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems have few analytical tools to estimate a room's leakage area and establish an appropriate flow differential (DeltaQ) in hospitals, shelters, and other facilities where communicable diseases are present. An accurate estimate of leakage area and selection of DeltaQ is essential for ensuring that there is negative pressure (i.e., pressure differential [DeltaP]) between an AIIR and adjoining areas. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) researchers evaluated the relationship between DeltaQ and DeltaP in 67 AIIRs across the United States and in simulated AIIR. Data gathered in the simulated AIIR was used to develop an empirical model describing the relationship between DeltaQ, DeltaP, and leakage area. Data collected in health care facilities showed that the model accurately predicted the leakage area 44 of 48 times. Statistical analysis of the model and experimental validation showed that the model effectively estimated the actual leakage area from -39% to +22% with 90% confidence.

Even trusts with updated plans failed to meet guidance in many areas. Thirty-five percent of Trusts had negative pressure facilities for the isolation of infectious tuberculosis patients. Depending on the risk category of the patient, 45-67% of Trusts met guidelines for isolation of infectious patients. Patients frequently left isolation for non-medical reasons.

For years, guidance on reducing the incidence of preventable health care-associated infections in community care has been based on standards developed for acute care settings. But in many cases, practices common in acute care are not directly transferable to the community. Also, shorter hospital stays mean care previously provided in hospital is increasingly carried out in the community.",,Nicole Pratelli

However, the evidence for the efficacy of many currently recommended measures is incomplete or has been established for certain sub-groups of patients or specific conditions only. In view of this situation, it is necessary to improve the established measures for preventing NIs.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18047166/,Introduction of an isolation policy in paediatric wards,"Where and how to care for children with infections, or those requiring protection, is a daily debate in many paediatric settings. The practice of placing patients into single rooms for infection control purposes is well documented but there is little guidance on when to remove patients from isolation rooms. Unless the appropriateness of isolation for each patient is evaluated daily, the availability of cubicles falls, resulting in potentially unnecessary transfers to other hospitals where such facilities are available. A new isolation policy was introduced to improve the availability of isolation rooms on paediatric wards in a large inner city teaching hospital with over 100 paediatric inpatient beds. A change management framework was used that included empowering organisational action and consolidating improvements. A number of strategies were introduced to prompt daily review of children in isolation, including clear criteria for isolation and nursing staff in the emergency department challenging the decision to admit a child into an isolation room. Introduction of the policy and subsequent audits have resulted in improved staff awareness, more effective use of isolation rooms and reduced transfers to other hospitals.",,Joanna Hall;Sharmela Roopnarine;Jane McLean

A questionnaire was sent to all dental practices in New Zealand, and non-returns were followed up by two further mailings. From three mailings 767 useable questionnaires were returned (71.3 per cent of those sent out, 79.0 per cent of those potentially valid). Responses indicated that formal guidelines were generally well received, but varying proportions thought that some recommendations were unrealistic or irrelevant. Asked whether the dental practice offered treatment to 'high risk' (HIV-positive or HBAg-positive) patients, 25.3 per cent responded that none sought treatment. Almost all practices (92.0 per cent) had an autoclave, but only 42.8 per cent of practices autoclaved dental handpieces, and 10.9 per cent of practices wiped, cold disinfected or boiled extraction forceps.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17540232/,"The Lowbury Lecture. The United States approach to strategies in the battle against healthcare-associated infections, 2006: transitioning from benchmarking to zero tolerance and clinician accountability","Approximately 2,000,000 healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) annually occur in US healthcare facilities and lead to approximately 60,000 90,000 deaths and cost $17 29 billion dollars. Such HAIs are an equal, if not more common problem, worldwide. Many evidence-based HAI prevention guidelines exist. However, despite knowing what to do, the challenge remains of getting clinicians to comply with these recommendations. In the USA, a variety of forces, including the public and legislators, are demanding HAI prevention. This is illustrated by the Consumers Union's effort to get legislation in every state for public HAI rate reporting. In addition, a number of profit-making and non-profit-making organizations have initiated major HAI prevention interventions. At least three common themes for these interventions exist. First, no single intervention prevents any HAI; rather a ""bundle"" approach, using a package of multiple interventions based on evidence provided by the infection control community and implemented by a multidisciplinary team is the model for successful HAI prevention. Second, benchmarking is inadequate and a culture of zero tolerance is required. Third, a culture of accountability and administrative support is required. Such interventions have illustrated that much greater levels of HAI prevention can be accomplished than ever estimated in the past. Implementation of evidence-based HAI prevention interventions should be a high priority for all healthcare facilities to reduce preventable HAIs to the greatest extent possible.",,William R Jarvis

But why - as we mark 150 years since the publication of Ignaz Semmelweis' landmark monograph on the subject - do we continue to repeat it? One might be tempted to regard it as a truism. However, while tremendous progress has certainly been made in this field, a significant amount of work is yet to be done in both strengthening the evidence regarding the impact of hand hygiene and maximizing its implementation. Hand hygiene cannot yet be taken for granted.
