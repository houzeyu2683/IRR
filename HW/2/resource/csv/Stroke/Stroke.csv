https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24361114/,Secondary stroke prevention,"Survivors of stroke and transient ischaemic attacks are at risk of a recurrent stroke, which is often more severe and disabling than the index event. Optimum secondary prevention of recurrent stroke needs rapid diagnosis and treatment and prompt identification of the underlying cardiovascular cause. Effective treatments include organised acute assessment and intervention with antithrombotic therapy, carotid revascularisation, and control of causal risk factors, as appropriate. However, effective treatments are not implemented optimally in clinical practice. Recurrent strokes continue to account for 25-30% of all strokes and represent unsuccessful secondary prevention. Immediate and sustained implementation of effective and appropriate secondary prevention strategies in patients with first-ever stroke or transient ischaemic attack has the potential to reduce the burden of stroke by up to a quarter.",,Graeme J Hankey
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31813521/,Perinatal Stroke,"Perinatal strokes are a diverse but specific group of focal cerebrovascular injuries that occur early in brain development and affect an estimated 5 million people worldwide. The objective of this review is to describe the epidemiology, clinical presentations, pathophysiology, outcomes, and management for the 6 subtypes of perinatal stroke. Some perinatal strokes are symptomatic in the first days of life, typically with seizures, including neonatal arterial ischemic stroke, neonatal hemorrhagic stroke, and cerebral sinovenous thrombosis. The remaining subtypes present in the first year of life or later, usually with motor asymmetry and include arterial presumed perinatal ischemic stroke, presumed perinatal hemorrhagic stroke, and in utero periventricular venous infarction. The consequences of these injuries include cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and cognitive and behavioral challenges, in addition to the psychosocial impact on families. While there have been significant advances in understanding mechanisms of both injury and recovery, there is still a great deal to learn regarding causation and the optimization of outcomes.",,Mary Dunbar;Adam Kirton
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25597418/,Cryptogenic stroke,"In about a quarter of ischaemic strokes the cause is undetermined, because the investigation is incomplete or delayed, because there are multiple causes or because the stroke is truly cryptogenic. Cryptogenic stroke can be further classified as non-embolic or embolic. Embolic stroke of undetermined source can be due to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, minor emboligenic cardiac conditions, atheroembolism, cancer associated and paradoxical embolism through a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or less often a pulmonary fistula. Currently, risk factor control, statins and antiplatelets are the main therapeutic measures to prevent recurrent stroke. There is no evidence to implement routine closure of PFO in patients with cryptogenic stroke. Direct anticoagulants are being evaluated in randomized controlled trials including embolic stroke of undetermined source patients. Advances in high resolution ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging of extracranial and intracranial vessels and of the heart and prolonged heart rhythm monitoring will be instrumental techniques to identify arterial and cardiac hidden causes of stroke.",cancer; cardiac monitoring; cryptogenic; embolic stroke of undetermined source; paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; patent foramen ovale; undetermined cause.,A C Fonseca;J M Ferro

In addition, the incidence of new and recurrent stroke is declining, likely because of the increased use of specific prevention medications, such as statins and antihypertensives. Despite these positive trends in incidence and mortality, many strokes remain preventable.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26300647/,Secondary stroke prevention: challenges and solutions,"Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the USA and a major cause of mortality worldwide. One out of four strokes is recurrent. Secondary stroke prevention starts with deciphering the most likely stroke mechanism. In general, one of the main goals in stroke reduction is to control vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and smoking cessation. Changes in lifestyle like a healthy diet and aerobic exercise are also recommended strategies. In the case of cardioembolism due to atrial fibrillation, mechanical valves, or cardiac thrombus, anticoagulation is the mainstay of therapy. The role of anticoagulation is less evident in the case of bioprosthetic valves, patent foramen ovale, and dilated cardiomyopathy with low ejection fraction. Strokes due to larger artery atherosclerosis account for approximately a third of all strokes. In the case of symptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis, surgical intervention as close as possible in time to the index event seems highly beneficial. In the case of intracranial large artery atherosclerosis, the best medical therapy consists of antiplatelets, high-dose statins, aggressive controls of vascular risk factors, and lifestyle modifications, with no role for intracranial arterial stenting or angioplasty. For patients with small artery occlusion (ie, lacunar stroke), the therapy is similar to that used in patients with intracranial large artery atherosclerosis. Despite the constant new evidence on how to best treat patients who have suffered a stroke, the risk of stroke recurrence remains unacceptably high, thus evidencing the need for novel therapies.",diabetes; dyslipidemia; hypertension; stroke mechanisms; stroke risk.,Charles Esenwa;Jose Gutierrez

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29212096/,[Stroke Mimics and Stroke Chameleons: Differential Diagnosis of Stroke],"The analysis of misdiagnosis of stroke has become increasingly relevant because of the time pressure in the thrombolytic treatment of ischemic strokes. Within the narrow time window of thrombolysis, a false-positive stroke diagnosis can lead to a faulty and potentially dangerous thrombolysis. The terms ""Stroke Mimic"" (SM = false-positive stroke diagnosis) and ""Stroke Chameleon"" (SC = false-negative stroke diagnosis) have been introduced for misdiagnosis in this field. The rate of SM decreases during the treatment phases from approximately 50 % in the preclinical situation to approximately 2-10 % in the Stroke Unit indicating thrombolytic therapy. The complication rate for not indicated thrombolysis in SM is low with 0.5 % for intracranial bleeding and 0.3 % for orolingual edema. Thus, the net balance in favour of fast thrombolysis is maintained, even when a higher number of mis-indicated lyses occurs in SM. The rate of SC during the stages of treatment drops from about 50 % in the preclinical stage to about 2-5 % in stroke units. The rates of SM and SC are inversely linked: a reduction in the SM rate leads to a more critical diagnosis of stroke, thus increasing the number of underdiagnosed stroke cases as SC, and vice versa. While SM rarely lead to the legal consequences of treatment error, SC often give rise to accusations of medical errors.",,Frank Erbguth

At that time neural progenitor cells derived from fetal brain tissue were used as sources of cells to replace specific subsets of neuronal cells that were lost in various regions of the brain following experimentally induced strokes. Since 1988, cells from other sources, such as embryonic stem cells and inducible pluripotent stem cells, have been investigated for their ability to replace neuronal cells and repair the damaged brain. Most recently, mesenchymal stem cells and cord blood stem cells have been studied for the ability to modulate the immune system and ameliorate the neuropathology and neurological deficits associated with experimental stroke. The preclinical investigation of different cell therapy approaches for treating stroke during the past three decades has now led to many ongoing clinical trials, with the clinical evaluation of stem cell therapies for stroke now involving global participants.",cell transplantation; neural repair; stroke.,Nikolas G Toman;Andrew W Grande;Walter C Low
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28502847/,The Role for Cardiologists in Stroke Intervention,"Even though cardiovascular disease (CVD) is still the leading cause of death in the United States, stroke is the second leading global cause of death behind CVD. In the 21st Century, less than 40% of overall stroke patients are discharged to home and almost 25% of Medicare beneficiaries do not survive 90 days. In spite of the fact that tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) has been approved for stroke care for 20 years, only .75% of annual strokes are actually treated with intravenous (IV) TPA. Similar to how interventional cardiologists evolved from IV to catheter mechanical treatment for acute myocardial infarctions (AMI) over 30 years ago, over the last few years, neurointerventionists now perform endovascular stroke therapy in many of these patients using stent retrievers. However, very few stroke patients are actually getting treatment, and neurointerventionists on an average perform only 8 stroke interventions per year. It has been recently shown that 9 out of 10 strokes can be prevented by controlling CVD risk factors. A principal job for cardiologists is to recognize and manage these CVD risk factors in addition to being involved with performing intervention. Atrial Fibrillation is certainly a common problem in all of our practices and puts people at five-fold higher risk of stroke. Cardiovascular cardiology teams already have 24/7 coverage for acute interventions for AMI in place at their facilities. A number of groups have replicated acute stroke care performed by cardiologists at centers worldwide with outstanding results. It makes sense that we try to build a collaboration among neuroradiologists, interventional cardiologists and perhaps vascular or neurosurgeons with expertise in acute endovascular procedures to develop programs for acute and active 24/7 stroke care similar to systems for primary angioplasty for AMI.",Acute ischemic stroke; Cardiology; Endovascular stroke therapy.,Richard R Heuser

There are two potential treatment strategies: restoring blood flow (reperfusion) and preventing cellular injury (neuroprotection). As yet, all the successful trials have involved reperfusion with numerous failures of neuroprotectants. There are two proven reperfusion strategies. Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase was first demonstrated to reduce disability with publication of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke tissue plasminogen activator trial in 1995. Since that time further trials have solidified the evidence base and demonstrated benefit when alteplase is administered within 4.5 hours of stroke onset. Exploration of potentially more effective thrombolytics is still underway with tenecteplase but others, such as desmoteplase, have been unsuccessful in clinical trials. The second proven reperfusion strategy is endovascular clot retrieval. This has been practiced for several years but came of age with the publication of five strongly positive trials in 2015.

Patients presenting with stroke of unknown onset are a common clinical scenario and a common reason for not offering reperfusion therapy. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of reperfusion therapy in stroke of unknown time of onset, when guided by advanced brain imaging. However, translation into clinical practice is challenged by variability in the available data. Comparison between studies is difficult because of use of different imaging modalities (magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography), different imaging paradigms (imaging biomarkers of lesion age versus imaging biomarkers of tissue viability), and different populations studied (ie, both patients with large vessel occlusion or those with less severe strokes). Physicians involved in acute stroke care are faced with the key question of which imaging approach they should use to guide reperfusion treatment for stroke with unknown time of onset. In this review, we provide an overview of the available evidence for selecting and treating patients with strokes of unknown onset, based on the underlying imaging concepts.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30797529/,Cryptogenic stroke - How to make sense of a non-diagnostic entity,"Secondary preventive strategies in ischaemic stroke depend on the underlying aetiology. However, approximately one-third of ischaemic strokes remain unexplained, or 'cryptogenic'. There is a wide range of possible underlying causes in cryptogenic stroke, and the best approach to secondary prevention of these may differ. To date, though, the widely accepted and uniform secondary preventive strategy in this group consists of modification of vascular risk factors, and of treatment with a combination of antiplatelet therapy and antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medication. Among the potential causes for cryptogenic stroke are occult atrial fibrillation, patent foramen ovale, atrial cardiopathy, aortic arch atheroma and hypercoagulable states. While it is possible to diagnose these conditions, in individual patients there is often uncertainty over whether they have a directly causative role, are markers of disease, or are innocent bystanders. Similarly, even if the cause is found, the best secondary preventive strategies remain uncertain, which questions the benefit of extensive investigations in a clinical setting. More recently, the concept of ""embolic stroke of unknown source (ESUS)"" has been introduced, in the hope that anticoagulation may offer better secondary prevention than antiplatelet therapy, but trials so far have been negative. At present, there is little justification for introducing extensive new investigative strategies into the management of patients with cryptogenic stroke. Investigations should be targeted at identifying those high-risk conditions which lead to a change in management. Further investigations need to be tailored individually, according to clinical circumstances. This should include identifying patients for participation in clinical trials, as the significance and best management of many of the potential causes for cryptogenic stroke require further research.",Aetiology; Ischaemic stroke; Risk factors.,Ursula G Schulz
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31858516/,Applications of Nanotechnology in the Diagnosis and Therapy of Stroke,"Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The classification of stroke subtypes is difficult but critical for the prediction of clinical course and patient management, and limited treatment options are available. There is an urgent need for improvements in both diagnosis and therapy. Strokes have rapidly evolving phases of damage involving unique compartments of the brain, which imposes severe limitations for current diagnostic and treatment procedures. The rapid development of nanotechnology in other areas of modern medicine has ignited a widespread interest in its potential for the field of stroke. An important feature of nanoparticles is the relative ease in which their structures and surface chemistries can be modified for specific and potentially multiple, simultaneous purposes. Nanoparticles can be synthesized to carry and deliver therapeutics to specific cellular or subcellular compartments; they can be engineered to provide enhanced contrast for imaging based on the detection of changes in the blood flow; or possess ligand-specific chemistries which can facilitate diagnosis and monitor the treatment response. More specifically for a stroke, nanoparticles can be engineered to release their payload in response to the distinct extracellular processes occurring around the clot and in the ischemic penumbra, as well as aid in the detection of pathological hallmarks present at various stages of stroke progression. These capacities allow targeted release of disease-modifying agents in the affected brain tissue, increasing treatment efficacy, and limiting unwanted side effects.

Methods- We retrospectively compared all acute ischemic stroke patients with an admission NIHSS of 0 in the Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne from 2003 to 2013 with all other acute ischemic stroke patients. We compared demographics, clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings. Outcome was considered favorable at 3 months if the modified Rankin Scale score corrected for prestroke disability was ≤1. Stroke recurrences >12 months were also assessed. Results- Comparing 108 NIHSS zero (NIHSS=0) patients with the 2889 other strokes by multivariate analysis, NIHSS=0 had lower prestroke disability, longer onset-to-hospital delays and more lacunar and infratentorial strokes. NIHSS=0 patients were less likely to have early ischemic changes on acute computed tomography, had less arterial pathology and lower creatinine levels. They were more likely to have favorable modified Rankin Scale score after correction for prestroke modified Rankin Scale score (zero versus others: 83.2% versus 44.6%) and less likely to die (3.9% versus 13.3%) at 12 months. Stroke and transient ischemic attack recurrence rates were similar (11% versus 11.4%), however. Conclusions- Patients with NIHSS=0 strokes are characterized by lacunar and infrantentorial strokes, normal acute computed tomography, and less arterial pathology. However, a significant proportion face recurrent ischemic events and persistent handicap at 12 months.

Three subgroups are identified: arterial ischemic stroke (AIS), cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) and haemorragic infarct. Many strokes are detected in the neonatal period due to early onset seizures, although symptoms can be more subtle leading to a significant delay in the diagnosis. MRI-DWI remains the best tool for a correct diagnosis, extension of the lesion and suggestion of timing. Lesions detected in utero or at early neonatal imaging with signs of tissue loss are considered ""foetal stroke"". The ""neonatal stroke"", with the symptoms in the first 4 days, shows the typical abnormalities of the acute phase evolving later in a white matter loss.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33252411/,Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source: A Primer for Nursing,"BACKGROUND: Cryptogenic stroke has been used to identify ischemic strokes with no identified cause; however, this classification is limited by the lack of a standardized and thorough evaluation. Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source is used to define those strokes with no identified cause after a standardized diagnostic workup. METHODS: We conducted a literature review from January 1, 2014, to July 31, 2020 including the term ""ESUS."" RESULTS: Embolic stroke of undetermined source accounts for approximately 25% of ischemic strokes and is used to classify patients with no identified cause of stroke despite routine brain imaging, noninvasive vascular imaging of the head and neck, a minimum of 24 hours of cardiac monitoring, and echocardiography. Studies have shown that these strokes may be caused by occult atrial fibrillation, occult malignancy, and other hypercoagulable states but are often identified after hospital discharge. The risk of recurrent stroke in ESUS patients remains high at 4.5% per year on single antiplatelet therapy. Ongoing research aims to identify biomarkers that can identify ESUS subgroups who may benefit from alternative antithrombotic therapies. CONCLUSION: Because of the complexity of the evaluation and the uncertainty associated with an unknown cause of stroke, neuroscience nurses caring for these patients should be familiar with ESUS and educate the patient about the condition and the importance of complying with all prescribed treatments, tests, and subsequent follow-up appointments after discharge.",,Loretta J Sutherly;Trina Belair;Fadi Nahab
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17940923/,Stroke in pregnancy,"Although pregnancy-associated stroke is uncommon, the risk of stroke is greatly increased above the low baseline rate in young patients during late pregnancy and, even more so, during the puerperium. Stroke is a major contributor to the serious morbidity and mortality of pregnancy. The physiological hormonally mediated changes in circulation, vascular tissue structure, and coagulability, and the pathological state of pre-eclampsia-eclampsia contribute to this increased risk of stroke. Pregnancy-associated strokes are roughly evenly divided among hemorrhagic strokes, mainly from rupture of aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs); ischemic strokes, mainly from late pregnancy and postpartum cerebral venous thrombosis; and strokes associated with pre-eclampsia-eclampsia, with a contribution from cardioembolism, especially in populations at risk from a high rate of underlying rheumatic valvular heart disease. Awareness of the types of stroke to expect during pregnancy will facilitate early diagnosis.

Changes in age structure of the Western population allow for the assumption that the number of concerned people is going to be doubled, maybe tripled, by the year 2050. Large epidemiological investigations showed that AF leads to a significant increase in mortality and morbidity. Approximately one-third of all strokes are caused by AF and, due to thromboembolic cause, these strokes are often more severe than those caused by other etiologies. Silent brain infarction is defined as the presence of cerebral infarction in the absence of corresponding clinical symptomatology. Progress in imaging technology simplifies diagnostic procedures of these lesions and leads to a large amount of diagnosed lesions, but there is still no final conclusion about frequency, risk factors, and clinical relevance of these infarctions. The prevalence of silent strokes in patients with AF is higher compared to patients without AF, and several studies reported high incidence rates of silent strokes after AF ablation procedures. While treatment strategies to prevent clinically apparent strokes in patients with AF are well investigated, the role of anticoagulatory treatment for prevention of silent infarctions is unclear.

Hence, stroke is the most common cause of seizures and epilepsy in the elderly population. Five percent are early-onset seizures (peak onset within the first day after the stroke) and another 5% are late-onset seizures (peak onset within 6 to 12 months after the stroke). Epilepsy (i.e., recurrent seizures) develops in 3% to 4% of the stroke patients (in about one third of the patients with early-onset seizures and about one half of the patients with late-onset seizures). There is a strong positive correlation between stroke severity and the risk of post-stroke seizures; the risk is very low in mild strokes. Seizures are more common in hemorrhagic stroke and in stroke with cortical involvement. Whether this is due to the hemorrhagic component or the cortical involvement per se, or a reflection of more severe strokes among patients with hemorrhagic strokes and lesions involving cortical structures, is not clear. The influence of seizures on outcome is still a matter of controversy.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25750539/,Strokes in young adults: epidemiology and prevention,"Strokes in young adults are reported as being uncommon, comprising 10%-15% of all stroke patients. However, compared with stroke in older adults, stroke in the young has a disproportionately large economic impact by leaving victims disabled before their most productive years. Recent publications report an increased incidence of stroke in young adults. This is important given the fact that younger stroke patients have a clearly increased risk of death compared with the general population. The prevalence of standard modifiable vascular risk factors in young stroke patients is different from that in older patients. Modifiable risk factors for stroke, such as dyslipidemia, smoking, and hypertension, are highly prevalent in the young stroke population, with no significant difference in geographic, climatic, nutritional, lifestyle, or genetic diversity. The list of potential stroke etiologies among young adults is extensive. Strokes of undetermined and of other determined etiology are the most common types among young patients according to TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) criteria. Prevention is the primary treatment strategy aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality related to stroke. Therefore, primary prevention is very important with regard to stroke in young adults, and aggressive treatment of risk factors for stroke, such as hypertension, smoking, and dyslipidemia, is essential. The best form of secondary stroke prevention is directed toward stroke etiology as well as treatment of additional risk factors. However, there is a lack of specific recommendations and guidelines for stroke management in young adults. In conclusion, strokes in young adults are a major public health problem and further research, with standardized methodology, is needed in order to give us more precise epidemiologic data. Given the increasing incidence of stroke in the young, there is an objective need for more research in order to reduce this burden.",age; cerebrovascular diseases; etiology; incidence; management; risk factors.,Dževdet Smajlović

The distinction between hemorrhagic and ischaemic strokes, as well as the identification of patients requiring immediate recanalization therapy, cannot be made by clinical examination but requires CT imaging. In most patients with an ischemic stroke, large parts of the affected brain area are functionless throughout the first hours, but not yet irreversibly damaged (penumbra tissue). These areas can be saved through early vessel recanalization. In the acute phase of ischaemic stroke, a delay of 15 minutes results in a significant worsening of the neurologic prognosis.With modern endovascular techniques, even patients with the most severe ischemic strokes have a fair chance of neurological recovery, if they are admitted to a specialised centre within the first few hours.",,Martin Wiesmann;Omid Nikoubashman

The majority of strokes may be asymptomatic because of being in a silent area, deep coma or associated pathology such as spinal arachnoiditis or tuberculoma. Methods of evaluation also influence the frequency of stroke. MRI is more sensitive in detecting acute (DWI) and chronic (T2, FLAIR) stroke. Most of the strokes in TBM are multiple, bilateral and located in the basal ganglia especially the 'tubercular zone' which comprises of the caudate, anterior thalamus, anterior limb and genu of the internal capsule. These are attributed to the involvement of medial striate, thalamotuberal and thalamostriate arteries which are embedded in exudates and likely to be stretched by a coexistent hydrocephalus. Cortical stroke can also occur due to the involvement of proximal portion of the middle, anterior and posterior cerebral arteries as well as the supraclinoid portion of the internal carotid and basilar arteries which are documented in MRI, angiography and autopsy studies. Arteritis is more common than infarction in autopsy study. The role of cytokines especially tumor necrosis factor (TNFα), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metaloproteineases (MMPs) in damaging the blood brain barrier, attracting leucocytes and release of vasoactive autocoids have been suggested. The prothrombotic state may also contribute to stroke in TBM.

This may, however, to a large degree be explained by the preponderance of women in the older age groups. Nevertheless, incidence of stroke is higher in men than in women. Overall rates of stroke decline, but more in men than in women; consequently the excess number of strokes in women will be on the rise in the years to come. Risk factors differ between men and women: e.g. rates of atrial fibrillation and hypertension are higher in women with stroke, while rates of e.g. smoking or high alcohol consumption are higher in men, while some risk factors including diabetes or smoking carries a higher risk in women than in men. Especially older women are less well represented in many trials, which reduces the generalizability of results to this from a stroke perspective extremely important population, however, in areas of treatment where sufficient data is available, e.g. i.v. thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy the benefit is equal between sexes and may even be higher in women due to their longer life expectancy. Access to care varies between regions depending both on cultural factors and the overall access to care; in especially lower income countries though data is very scarce the impression is that women's access to care is restricted in comparison to men. Specific female risk factors including pregnancy or sex hormone therapy are rare causes of stroke especially in high-income countries, however these stroke events occur early in life and have massive effect of individual families. Evidence on stroke care in these events is extremely limited and more data, also including prospective generalizable observational data is urgently needed to guide clinicians.

Roughly one third of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and ischemic strokes are classified as cryptogenic, with an even greater proportion in young patients. While classification systems have been successfully used in trials to refine therapeutic approaches specific to subtype, there has been little progress made in secondary prevention of cryptogenic stroke. The cryptogenic stroke/ESUS International Working Group recently proposed a new entity under the realm of cryptogenic stroke called embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). This clinical construct emerged from data suggesting thromboembolism as the primary etiology of cryptogenic strokes. While current trials are addressing covert atrial fibrillation as a significant source of embolism, more recent population data has called this hypothesis into question and illustrated the heterogeneity, and often multiplicity, of embolic sources. The importance of carotid artery plaques which do not cause significant stenosis as a source of emboli to the brain has generally been ignored given the long-standing focus of using percent stenosis measurements as the primary criterion for defining high-risk carotid atherosclerotic disease. As part of the required diagnostic workup to define ESUS, vascular imaging, and advances therein, provides a unique opportunity to prospectively determine a subset of patients who may benefit from aggressive medical therapy or endovascular interventions in the prevention of recurrent ESUS.

These sex differences have profound implications for effective prevention and treatment and are the focus of this review. Epidemiologic studies reveal a clear age-by-sex interaction in stroke prevalence, incidence, and mortality. While premenopausal women experience fewer strokes than men of comparable age, stroke rates increase among postmenopausal women compared with age-matched men. This postmenopausal phenomenon, in combination with living longer, are reasons for women being older at stroke onset and suffering more severe strokes. Thus, a primary focus of stroke prevention has been based on sex steroid hormone-dependent mechanisms. Sex hormones affect different (patho)physiologic functions of the cerebral circulation. Clarifying the impact of sex hormones on cerebral vasculature using suitable animal models is essential to elucidate male-female differences in stroke pathophysiology and development of sex-specific treatments. Much remains to be learned about sex differences in stroke as anatomic and genetic factors may also contribute, revealing its multifactorial nature. In addition, the aftermath of stroke appears to be more adverse in women than in men, again based on older age at stroke onset, longer prehospital delays, and potentially, differences in treatment.",,Roy A M Haast;Deborah R Gustafson;Amanda J Kiliaan

Risk factors for in-hospital stroke include specific operations and procedures (eg, cardiac surgery), previous medical disorders (especially a history of stroke), and certain physiological characteristics (including fever and dehydration). The stroke subtype is embolic in a large proportion, and there are various possible precipitating mechanisms. Outcome can be poor, with high mortality. Interventional therapies, particularly thrombolysis, are possible options. In the postoperative setting, intra-arterial thrombolysis is feasible and reasonably safe in carefully selected patients.

Extensive epidemiological evidence and robust data from clinical trials have shown that stroke and thromboembolism in AF can be prevented by oral anticoagulation (OAC). Despite this evidence and guidelines, appropriate thromboprophylaxis is still suboptimal, and this is partly due to the only OAC agent being available is the vitamin K antagonist class of drugs (e.g. warfarin) that has many limitations and disadvantages. With the availability of new OAC agents that avoid the disutility of the vitamin K antagonists, it is hoped that greater use of OAC would allow more effective thromboprophylaxis and have a great impact on preventing strokes related to AF. Additionally, stroke risk assessments need to evolve such that they are better at identifying the 'truly low risk' subjects who do not need antithrombotic therapy, whilst all other patients with ≥ 1 stroke risk factors can be considered for OAC.

The majority of strokes are of ischemic origin, with an atherothrombotic trigger, and the clinical manifestation of atherothrombosis depends on the affected vascular site. The systemic nature of atherosclerosis means that stroke patients are at increased risk of ischemic events in several vascular beds, including cerebral, coronary and peripheral sites. Because stroke patients are at heightened risk of more ischemic events, secondary prevention is an important therapeutic goal. Recently, the American Heart Association and its division, the American Stroke Association, released new evidence-based guidelines for secondary stroke prevention in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. The new guidelines emphasize an individualized, patient-oriented approach to treatment based on clinical evidence. Evidence-based recommendations are set forth for the management of risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes, through lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions.

Greece presents an increase in mortality rates according to World Health Organization, and this fact underlines the need for early diagnosis and treatment, as well as, the need to implement effective prevention strategies for strokes. This review makes an effort to describe the current status of stroke epidemiological features, as well as to present the risk factors prevalent in Greece. The incidence rate is 261-319/100,000 based on the recent population based registry. Stroke appears to be more prevalent in men than in women, and the mean age of stroke onset in Greece is at 70 years of age. Hypertension, atrial fibrillation, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus are the major risk factors of stroke in the Greek population, while smoking is the most commonly documented modifiable risk factor in young adults with ischemic stroke. Similar to other parts of the world, ischemic stroke is the most common stroke type. The 28-day case fatality rate for men and women was 26.5%. The mean in-hospital cost per stroke patient was 3624.9 € and the mean rehabilitation cost of outpatients with stroke was 5553.3 €, while the cost proportion of hemorrhagic stroke is higher when compared to ischemic stroke.

Strokes are subdivided into two major classifications: ischemic (80-87 percent) andhemorrhagic (13-20 percent). Ischemic strokes occur from thrombi, emboli, or global hypoperfusion. Hemorrhagic strokes are either parenchymal (10 percent of all strokes) or subarachnoid (3 percent of all strokes). There are a variety of recognized risk factors for stroke which include: age, race, family history, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, cardiac arrhythmias, prosthetic valves, hyperlipidemia, cigarette smoking, and others (drugs or hormones). The initial assessment of a patient suspected of stroke should be done quickly enough to ensure maximal reperfusion of brain tissue. The steps to achieve this goal are: 1) exclude an intracranial hemorrhage, 2) assess for contraindications to thrombolytics, 3) characterize the infarct. The workup for a patient should first include a history (especially the time when neurologic symptoms began), a physical exam (including the NIHSS), and imaging studies (to rule out hemorrhagic components). In addition, several lab studies can also be obtained including: PT/INR, glucose, complete blood count, metabolic panel, creatine kinase, ECG, echocardiogram, lipid panel, carotid Doppler, MRA or CTA. Acute management of a stroke is primarily focused on stabilizing the patient and allowing as much reperfusion as possible for at-risk brain tissue. Stroke management in the acute setting includes: use of thrombolytics if indicated, and re-assessment to monitor progression. Several trials have been completed in pursuit of safety and effectiveness of intra-arterial stroke therapy for patients outside the recommended thrombolytic time window, but so far they are only experimental treatment options. The best preventative measures for first time or recurrent stroke are: starting or switching antiplatelet therapy, treatment of cardiovascular risk factors (atrial fibrillation and carotid stenosis), optimization of hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus management, and smoking cessation.",,Megan Albertson;Jitendra Sharma

Minor stroke and transient ischemic attack patients are typically treated conservatively with antiplatelet agents and general vascular prevention strategies. Yet a high proportion develop recurrent stroke or progression of stroke and up to one in four of these patients are disabled or dead at follow-up. Minor or rapidly improving symptoms are the top reasons for withholding thrombolytic therapy to time-eligible stroke patients as they are believed to be 'too good to treat'. The benefits and risks of treating mild ischemic strokes are still unclear. The increasing use of computed tomography angiography and its ability to identify both proximal and distal intracranial occlusions may change this equation.

A review of recent advances in management of acute ischemic stroke,"Acute ischemic strokes account for 85% of all strokes and are the fifth leading cause of mortality in the United States. About one in five of all ischemic strokes occur during sleep and are not noticed until the patient wakes up with neurological deficits. There is growing evidence to support that a significantly higher number of stroke patients could benefit from more aggressive care, especially those patients who wake up with strokes. There is increasing research to support a physiologically-based approach based on advanced imaging rather than simply a time-based determination of whether or not a patient would benefit from reperfusion. Advanced imaging such as CT-Perfusion and MR DWI-FLAIR can be used to establish the age of the lesion and determine the extent of the brain tissue that is salvageable. If physicians could identify those patients with wake-up strokes that are candidates for intervention, there may be opportunity to treat 3 million more people, reducing long term disability and healthcare expenditures. Patients who are in the window for IV rtPA should receive it as soon as possible as well as be evaluated for mechanical thrombectomy. For those who are out of the window for IV rtPA, consider further imaging such as CTP and MR brain for diffusion-weighted sequences to evaluate for potential endovascular intervention. If a large vessel occlusion is present and imaging demonstrates a small infarct core and a large area of salvageable tissue, mechanical thrombectomy may be beneficial for the best possible functional outcome.",Core infarct; IV rtPA; Mechanical thrombectomy; Penumbra; Wake-up stroke.,Danielle Biggs;Michael E Silverman;Frank Chen;Brian Walsh;Peter Wynne

The main part of strokes is ischemic stroke (IS). IS is a complex (multifactorial) polygenic disease, i.e. develops as a result of interactions between risk factors and genetic components that determine a joint contribution of the sets of independently acting or interacting polymorphic genes. Currently, the search for a genetic predisposition to IS uses two main methods that are based on the analysis of the association between the polymorphic regions of the genome and disease: a candidate gene approach and genome-wide association studies, followed by a meta-analysis of the received results. In this work we reviewed the literature on genetic susceptibility to IS. It showed progress in this direction, which can be the starting point for the study of the molecular mechanisms determining the pathophysiology of IS. However to a full solution of the problem of identification of the genetic risk factors applicable for the individual prognosis of predisposition to IS, still very far, mainly due to the low replication of results.

The average annual incidence rate of stroke in India currently is 145 per 100,000 population, which is higher than the western nations. Rapid socio-economic changes have led to changes in people's lifestyle, work related stress, altered food habits and the risk of developing hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidaemia.

Both diastolic and isolated systolic hypertension are important predictors of primary or recurrent strokes, and even minor decreases in BP can reduce the risk of stroke. While the primary prevention of stroke through the treatment of hypertension is well established, the issue of lowering BP after a stroke has been uncertain, particularly since this might worsen cerebral perfusion if autoregulation remains chronically damaged or severe carotid artery stenosis is present. Furthermore, there is substantial evidence to support BP lowering for prevention of a first stroke; however, few trials have focused on antihypertensive therapy for recurrent stroke prevention. In fact, currently, BP management in patients with strokes remains problematic, and questions such as the choice of antihypertensive drug and by how much to reduce BP are yet to be resolved.

Even though the clinical presentation of arterial-ischaemic stroke in children (pedAIS) is similar to adults, time to diagnosis is longer. The delay to diagnosis is mainly explained by the low index of suspicion of both the general population and the medical personnel, a broad range of differential diagnoses, and the fact that diagnostic imaging in children often requires sedation, which is not always readily available. PedAIS is a multiple risk problem, usually occurring due to a combination of risk factors, such as infectious diseases, dehydration, trauma or an underlying condition such as congenital heart disease. Still little is known about the appropriate management of pedAIS. Supportive measures are considered to be the mainstay of therapy. The use of antithrombotic medication depends on pedAIS aetiology.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19849661/,Dyslipidemia as a risk factor for ischemic stroke,"Ischemic stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Whereas dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD), its role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke is less clear. Epidemiological studies have provided conflicting findings regarding the association of dyslipidemia with ischemic stroke. Overall, elevated LDL-C levels appear to increase the risk of ischemic stroke. Low HDL-C levels also appear to be associated with a greater risk whereas the importance of high triglyceride levels is less clear. The discordant results of observational studies might result from the heterogeneity of stroke, since dyslipidemia is less likely to play a major role in the pathogenesis of some ischemic stroke subtypes (e.g. lacunar and cardioembolic strokes) and elevated LDL-C levels might increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. In clinical trials, statins consistently reduced the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with or without CHD whereas the data on the effects of other lipid modifying drugs on stroke risk are limited. In patients with a previous stroke, statins reduce the risk of both ischemic stroke and other vascular events but also increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Accordingly, current guidelines recommend the same lipid targets for the primary and secondary prevention of both stroke and CHD. In addition, stroke and transient ischemic attacks of carotid origin are considered CHD risk equivalents.

However, the specific characteristics of the gut microbiota in patients suffering different types of ischemic stroke, or recovering from such strokes, have rarely been studied, and potential microbiotic predictors of different types of stroke have seldom been analyzed. We subjected fecal specimens from patients with lacunar or non-lacunar acute ischemic infarctions, and those recovering from such strokes, to bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing and compared the results to those of healthy volunteers. We identified microbial markers of different types of ischemic stroke and verified that these were of diagnostic utility. Patients with two types of ischemic stroke, and those recovering from ischemic stroke, exhibited significant shifts in microbiotic diversities compared to healthy subjects. Cluster of Orthologous Groups of Proteins (COG) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses revealed reduced metabolic and transport-related pathway activities in ischemic stroke patients. We performed fivefold cross-validation using a Random Forest model to identify two optimal bacterial species (operational taxonomic units; OTUs) serving as markers of lacunar infarction; these were Lachnospiraceae (OTU_45) and Bacteroides (OTU_4), and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs under the ROCs) were 0.881 and 0.872 respectively. In terms of non-lacunar acute ischemic infarction detection, the two optimal species were Bilophila (OTU_330) and Lachnospiraceae (OTU_338); the AUCs under the ROCs were 0.985 and 0.929 respectively. In post-ischemic stroke patients, the three optimal species were Pseudomonas (OTU_35), Sphingomonadaceae (OTU_303), and Akkermansia (OTU_9); the AUCs under the ROCs were 1, 0.897, and 0.846 respectively.

Their occurrence reflects the lifestyle and eating habits of a society. In industrialized countries stroke causes a significant loss of DALYs. Each year, approximately 150 persons per 100,000 inhabitants suffer a stroke. Half a year after the stroke, two of three stroke victims are dead or dependent, and all stroke survivors are at risk to suffer recurrent strokes. Stroke is due to a focal ischemia. In the core of the ischemia blood flow is reduced substantially, mostly to a level below the infarction threshold. In the borderzone collaterals can still provide sufficient blood to preserve the neurons though the reduced blood flow does not suffice for neuronal functioning. This state below functional and above infarction threshold is called penumbra. When the stroke signs are recognized early and the occluded vessel is recanalized with thrombolytics or mechanically the brain tissue in the penumbra can be preserved and the fate of the stroke victim is improved compared to spontaneous course. Before administration of thrombolytics neurological examination and imaging of the brain using CT or MRI are necessary. After stroke, survivors will benefit significantly from secondary prevention. In order to perform an individually tailored prevention, additional investigations such as neurovascular and cardiac ultrasound, cardiac monitoring and blood examinations are necessary to define the cause of the stroke.

Infections that present subsequent to stroke also complicate up to a third of cases of stroke and might worsen outcome. Inflammatory responses, which are a defence mechanism against infection but can also be a pathogenic mechanism that precipitates stroke and neurological sequelae, are important features. Although factors such as stroke severity and dysphagia are important predictors of poststroke infection, there is evidence from experimental and clinical settings of impaired immunity or brain-induced immunodepression after stroke. Greater understanding of the relation between inflammation and both infection and ischaemic mechanisms is needed. This might be particularly important because new treatment strategies for acute ischaemic stroke are being investigated, including those that modulate cytokines and the immune system.",,Hedley C A Emsley;Stephen J Hopkins

The metabolic syndrome associated with insulin resistance is also a significant risk factor for stroke. The etiology of stroke in diabetics is frequently microvascular disease from fibrinoid necrosis, which causes small subcortical infarcts designated as lacunar strokes. Diabetics also have an increased incidence of large vessel intracranial vascular disease.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15015903/,Secondary prevention of stroke: a practical guide to drug treatment,"Stroke is a disease of the elderly and, as a result of the expected demographic changes in many industrialised countries, its incidence is likely to increase in the future. A first-ever stroke significantly increases the likelihood of further events; thus, secondary prevention is of major importance. Only a minority of recurrent strokes can be prevented by surgical or other invasive methods, meaning that most secondary preventive measures involve drug treatment, which has become increasingly sophisticated in recent years. Ischaemic stroke constitutes the vast majority of all strokes; effective secondary prevention depends on a variety of factors, of which the correct classification in terms of subtypes and aetiological mechanisms is a pivotal prerequisite, as is the assessment of the patient's cardiovascular risk profile. In addition to the evaluation of pathomechanisms, stratification of subtypes of brain infarction is mainly based on morphology seen with brain imaging techniques, which provides additional evidence for the presumed cause of the stroke. Inhibitors of platelet function and anticoagulants are the two major groups of antithrombotic drugs used for the secondary prevention of stroke. Antiplatelet agents are still indicated in the majority of patients after ischaemic stroke, especially if an arterial origin is presumed. In addition to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), the position of which as the first-line antiplatelet drug is increasingly being questioned, other compounds with antiplatelet activity have been developed and have proven effective in secondary stroke prevention, including ticlopidine, clopidogrel and dipyridamole. Anticoagulants are principally indicated after cardioembolic ischaemic stroke; however, their inherent bleeding risks render their use in many cases rather difficult, in particular for elderly patients. Patient compliance with the recommended treatment is of major importance, given the somewhat limited efficacy of antithrombotic agents in stroke prevention. Since 'real world' experience does not match the circumstances under which clinical trials are conducted, this article will also deal with problems not covered by specific studies, such as risk stratification for anticoagulant treatment and how to proceed in cases of unknown stroke aetiology. The management of major cardiovascular risk factors is the other mainstay of secondary stroke prevention. Recent evidence indicates that antihypertensive treatment may be as effective as antithrombotic drugs for secondary prevention of stroke. This still needs to be proven for the treatment of other cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia. Nevertheless, the results of recent studies investigating the effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ('statins') on cardiovascular events strongly suggest a stroke-preventive effect.",,H-C Koennecke

However, there is ample evidence that statins reduce stroke risk in selected patient groups such as survivors of myocardial infarction. This apparent paradox can be explained on the one hand by the heterogeneity of strokes as a group and on the other hand by the specific characteristics of statins. There are strong indications for a relationship between blood lipid profiles and types of stroke that have atherosclerosis as the underlying pathogenetic mechanism. Apart from their ability to reduce LDL levels significantly, statins have a number of other properties, which influence the process of atherosclerosis at various stages.

Atrial fibrillation is considered a major risk factor for stroke. Although long-term prophylactic oral anticoagulation has been shown to be very effective in reducing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, it has a number of major limitations and is not feasible in all patients. In such cases, the use of percutaneously (transvenous) implanted left atrial appendage occlusive devices or surgical appendage obliteration is being explored. Similarly, the presence of a patent foramen ovale, especially in the presence of an atrial septal aneurysm, is now recognized as an important potential mediator of paradoxical cardiogenic embolism.

Advances in imaging techniques and improved understanding of stroke pathophysiology have prompted a reassessment of cryptogenic stroke. There is persuasive evidence that most cryptogenic strokes are thromboembolic. The thrombus is thought to originate from any of several well established potential embolic sources, including minor-risk or covert cardiac sources, veins via paradoxical embolism, and non-occlusive atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic arch, cervical, or cerebral arteries. Accordingly, we propose that embolic strokes of undetermined source are a therapeutically relevant entity, which are defined as a non-lacunar brain infarct without proximal arterial stenosis or cardioembolic sources, with a clear indication for anticoagulation. Because emboli consist mainly of thrombus, anticoagulants are likely to reduce recurrent brain ischaemia more effectively than are antiplatelet drugs.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11437187/,Stroke in children with sickle cell anaemia: aetiology and treatment,"Cerebral infarction is a frequent, severe complication of sickle cell anaemia. During childhood, most strokes are due to infarction with the majority resulting from occlusion of the large cerebral arteries. Risk factors include transient ischaemic attacks, acute chest syndrome, severe anaemia and elevated blood pressure. Less certain is the association with leucocytosis, or protection provided by alpha-thalassaemia or fetal haemoglobin. Children who have one stroke are at significant risk for having subsequent events that can be substantially reduced by maintaining haemoglobin S below 30%. It has not yet been possible to identify individuals for whom transfusion can be safely stopped. Haemosiderosis is a consequence of intensive and long term transfusion therapy, which requires chelation with deferoxamine. Iron accumulation can be minimised using erythrocytapheresis but this is technically difficult in children, expensive and results in increased donor exposure. In addition to lesions associated with strokes, an additional 17% of patients can be shown to have clinically silent cerebral infarcts. Although these are termed 'silent', those affected have mild neuropsychological deficits. Their relationship to stroke or risk for recurrence is unknown. Transfusion therapy has been shown to provide primary stroke prevention for children who have elevated cerebral artery velocity. Finally, intracranial haemorrhages, more commonly found in adults, also affect children. Subarachnoid haemorrhage is frequently found to result from cerebral artery aneurysms.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26162958/,Oral anticoagulant therapy in atrial fibrillation patients at high stroke and bleeding risk,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a 5-fold greater risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism compared with normal sinus rhythm. Cardioembolic AF-related strokes are often more severe, fatal or associated with greater permanent disability and higher recurrence rates than strokes of other aetiologies. These strokes may be effectively prevented with oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy, using either vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or non-vitamin K antagonist OACs (NOACs) such as the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran or direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban. Most AF patients have a positive net clinical benefit from OAC, excluding those with AF and no conventional stroke risk factors. Balancing the risks of stroke and bleeding is necessary for optimal use of OAC in clinical practice, and modifiable bleeding risk factors must be addressed. Concerns remain over 'non-changeable' bleeding risk factors such as older age, significant renal or hepatic impairment, prior stroke(s) or prior bleeding event(s) and active malignancies. Such AF patients are often termed 'special' AF populations, due to their 'special' risk profile that includes increased risks of both thromboembolic and bleeding events, and due to fear of bleeding complications these AF patients are often denied OAC. Evidence shows, however, that the absolute benefits of OAC are the greatest in patients at the highest risk, and NOACs may offer even a greater net clinical benefit compared to warfarin particularly in these high risk patients. In this review article, we summarize available data on stroke prevention in AF patients at increased risk of both stroke and bleeding and discuss the use of NOACs for thromboprophylaxis in these 'special' AF populations.",Anticoagulation; Atrial fibrillation; Stroke; Systemic embolism.,Tatjana S Potpara;Gregory Y H Lip

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10532644/,Risk factors and their management for stroke prevention: outlook for 1999 and beyond,"Stroke is a leading cause of death and morbidity, but incidence rates vary dramatically from one population to another. The reasons for this heterogeneity are being explored in several large-scale epidemiologic studies around the world. Much of the heterogeneity in stroke can be related to the prevalence of risk factors, but some populations have a higher stroke incidence than would be predicted from risk factor levels. Hypertension, including borderline hypertension, is probably the most important stroke risk factor based on degree of risk and prevalence. However, cardiac morbidity, cigarette smoking, diabetes, physical inactivity, and high levels of alcohol consumption are also strongly related to stroke risk. High levels of blood cholesterol and homocysteine may also increase stroke risk. Mortality after stroke is highest within the first 30 days but remains elevated to a degree that depends on the presenting stroke syndrome, stroke subtype, and other co-morbidities. Lacunar strokes have the best short- and long-term prognoses. Strokes due to large-vessel atherosclerosis frequently worsen; these and cardioembolic strokes have the poorest long-term prognosis. The risk for recurrence is also highest within 30 days after a first stroke, depending on the type of infarct, history of hypertension, and blood glucose levels on admission. Predictors of late recurrence include cardiac disease, hypertension, and heavy alcohol use.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28669374/,Reconciling Marriage and Care after Stroke,"Most research on stroke's impact on couples has focused on the transition to caregiving/receiving. Despite considerable evidence that marriage is the primary source of support in the face of chronic conditions, little is known about what happens to marriage in the context of care after stroke. To address this gap, we undertook a qualitative grounded-theory study of 18 couples in which one partner had experienced a stroke. Findings revealed two interrelated themes of the couple processes: working out care, which involved discovering and addressing disruptions in day-to-day activities; and rethinking marriage, which involved determining the meaning of their relationship within the new context of care and disability. Three distinct types of marriages evolved from these processes: reconfirmed around their pre-stroke marriage; recalibrated around care; and a parallel relationship, ""his"" and ""her"" marriage. Our findings highlight the need to consider relationship dynamics in addition to knowledge about stroke and care.",accident vasculaire cérébral; adultes plus âgés; aging; mariage; marriage; older adults; relations; relationships; stroke; vieillissement.,Sharon Anderson;Norah Keating;Donna Wilson
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12823485/,The quality of acute stroke units on a nation-wide level: the Austrian Stroke Registry for acute stroke units,"Concepts for stroke units that cover the acute phase vary. Therefore, the network of acute stroke units that is being set up in Austria in a uniform way is of general interest. This nationwide network has been established in accordance to evidence-based recommendations and prespecified criteria for available resources. The location for such a unit follows a maximum of 90-min isochrones (transport time) to the hospital. The quality of the network is currently documented and the results are reported. A nationwide stroke registry was prospectively performed on 15 stroke units that were already functional in this network. The aim was to document the quality performance of Austrian stroke units, focusing on rapid admissions, ready availability of investigations and therapies performed. Outcome measures were Barthel scale, Rankin score and percentages of complications. Between August 1998 and December 2000, 2,313 patients with ischemic stroke or with primary intracerebral hemorrhage admitted to an Austrian stroke unit within 24 h after onset of symptoms were prospectively included. Forty-three percent of the patients had a moderate or severe stroke. Fifty-seven percent of all patients were admitted to the stroke unit within 3 h after the onset of symptoms. Twenty-seven percent of these patients were brought in by ambulance accompanied by an emergency physician. Two percent of patients were admitted by helicopter. Fifty-four percent of patients had their first brain imaging within 30 min after admission, another 26% within 3 h. Intravenous thrombolysis was performed in 4.1% of patients. The overall stroke-unit mortality was about 6.8% and mortality at 3 months was 12.9%. The outcome at 3 months showed a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 or 1 in 47% of patients, denoting none or mild impairment. This network of acute stroke units is highly efficient in terms of rapid admissions, short intrahospital delays, as well as rapid use of readily available investigations. Stroke units seem to be well accepted by the general public and the medical community because our data show that all types of strokes are treated in Austrian stroke units, including severe strokes. The total number of concurrently treated acute strokes in other institutions across Austria is not known and no formal comparison with other systems of hospitalized care was undertaken, therefore further research is necessary.",,M M Steiner;M Brainin;Austrian Stroke Registry for Acute Stroke Units
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10809909/,Acute neurological stroke care in Europe: results of the European Stroke Care Inventory,"Following the 1997 Recommendations of the EFNS Task Force on Acute Neurological Stroke Care (European Journal of Neurology, 1997: 4:435-441) a European Inventory was undertaken to assess the development of acute stroke care in the EFNS member countries and to give an estimate of the needs based on 1997 data. All 30 members of the EFNS Stroke Scientist Panel were asked to complete a questionnaire on acute stroke epidemiology as well as acute stroke care in their country. Data were based either on national surveys, hospital statistics, or estimates given on the basis of extrapolation of regional studies, or other defined sources. Specialist estimates were also taken into account where no other data source was available. Data from 22 countries were received and referred to almost one million strokes occurring per year in a population of over 500 million. Most epidemiological data confirmed an east-west gap known from previous studies. These included rates that, in eastern countries, were higher for incidence, stroke as a leading cause of death, and 30-day case-fatality, and rates that were lower for overall hospitalization or availability of CT scanning. East-west differences were not seen for the total number of acute stroke units or the number of acute stroke units set up within neurological hospital departments, nor for most other quality indicators of acute stroke care with the exception of technological standards in some countries. The higher rates for 30-day case-fatality in eastern Europe (mostly above 20%) compared with western Europe (mostly below 20%) are probably caused by a case mix with more severe ischemic strokes and a higher percentage of cerebral haemorrhages admitted for acute care in eastern Europe. This is probably due to the higher prevalence of the most common risk factors for stroke in these countries which tend to result in more severe strokes. This, therefore, underlines the need for stroke prevention programmes especially in eastern Europe. This epidemiological east-west gap is not reflected by most quality indicators for acute stroke care, e.g. total number of acute stroke units available within each country. Most eastern European countries have a well-developed neurological care system for acute stroke but still have urgent technological and socioeconomical needs. The leading role of clinical neurology in acute stroke care is visible in most but not all European countries.",,M Brainin;N Bornstein;G Boysen;V Demarin
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12698012/,Long-term outcome after stroke due to atrial fibrillation,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. AF is paroxysmal or persistent and becomes permanent when it does not convert to sinus rhythm spontaneously or when attempted cardioversion fails. The prevalence of AF is 0.4% in the general population and increases with age up to 6-8% in octogenarians. In men, the age-adjusted prevalence is generally higher than in women. During AF, synchronous mechanical atrial activity is disturbed, resulting in haemodynamic impairment. This can give rise to thrombus formation and embolism to the systemic circulation. Thrombus associated with AF arises most frequently in the left atrial appendage. Cerebrovascular emboli in AF patients most often manifest as transient ischaemic attacks or ischaemic strokes. The overall rate of ischaemic stroke among patients with nonrheumatic AF averages 5% per year, but the rate increases with age. Patients with AF are at higher risk of cerebrovascular events from all causes. Of all strokes, one in every six occurs in patients with AF. Including transient ischaemic attacks and silent strokes detected radiographically, the overall rate of all cerebrovascular events in AF patients rises to more than 7% per year, although approximately one third of these are due to causes that are only secondarily or incidentally associated with AF or related anticoagulant therapy. Antiarrhythmic therapy is useful to improve cardiac rate and function in AF. However, to reduce first or recurrent emboli, antithrombotic therapy is of paramount importance. Results from several randomized clinical trials of antithrombotic therapies have shown that adjusted-dose warfarin reduces first or recurrent stroke by about 60% compared with placebo. When patients with nonvalvular AF are anticoagulated, the odds against ischaemic stroke and intracranial bleeding favour an INR between 2.0 and 3.0. Acetylsalicylic acid is less efficacious than warfarin in AF patients, reducing the risk of stroke by about 20%. Therefore, this antiplatelet agent should be used only for AF patients at low risk. Anticoagulation is the current treatment modality in AF patients at high or intermediate risk, i.e. patients with history of transient ischaemic attack or stroke, those aged >65 years, those with a history of hypertension, diabetes, heart failure or structural heart disease, valvular disease or significant systolic dysfunction. The benefit of dual antiplatelet regimens in AF patients is unknown, and combining antiplatelet agents with different mechanisms of action is an important topic for future investigation.",,Heinrich P Mattle

Stroke is the third leading cause of death and disability in developed nations. The complex pathophysiology of this medical problem includes excitotoxicity mechanisms, inflammatory pathways, oxidative damage and ionic imbalances. The final event is the ischemic neuronal death which results in an irreversible loss of the neuronal function. Recently, significant therapeutic advances have been made which include use of carotid endarterectomy, thrombolytics, anticoagulant therapy, antiplatelet agents, neuroprotective agents, and treating associated risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipemia. However, in spite of the significant development in these areas of stroke research, none of the available therapeutic options are curative in that they can reduce the burden of stroke.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20876498/,Is patent foramen ovale a modifiable risk factor for stroke recurrence?,"Although the prevalence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) in the general population is ≈25%, it is approximately doubled among cryptogenic stroke (CS) patients. This has generally been attributed to paradoxical embolism, and many physicians recommend PFO closure to prevent recurrence. However, the benefit of PFO closure in patients with stroke has not been demonstrated. Furthermore, the epidemiology of stroke recurrence in patients with CS with PFO versus without PFO and in those with large right-to-left shunts versus small right-to-left shunts has yielded results that appear difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that paradoxical embolism is an important cause of stroke recurrence. The purpose of this review is to critically examine the epidemiologic evidence that PFO is a potentially modifiable risk factor for stroke recurrence in patients with CS. The evidence suggests that many patients with CS and PFO have strokes that are PFO attributable, but many have strokes that are unrelated to their PFO. We introduce the concept of ""PFO propensity,"" defined as the patient-specific probability of finding a PFO in a patient with CS on the basis of age and other risk factors. We show that this value is directly related to the probability that CS is PFO attributable. Because there is substantial heterogeneity in both PFO propensity and recurrence risk among patients with PFO and CS, stratification for PFO closure by these joint probabilities will likely prove crucial for appropriate patient selection.",,David M Kent;David E Thaler

The purpose of this study was to identify the stroke area responsible for urinary retention by localizing the areas where strokes occur. We assessed 110 patients with cerebral infarction and 27 patients with cerebral hemorrhage (78 men, 59 women; mean age, 73.0 years) who had been admitted to our hospital between October, 2012 and September, 2013. We used computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the stroke location, and evaluated whether post-stroke urinary retention occurred. Twelve (8.8%) of the 137 patients (7 men, 5 women; mean age, 78.8 years) exhibited urinary retention after a stroke. Stroke occurred in the right/left dominant hemisphere in 7 patients; nondominant hemisphere in 1; cerebellum in 3; and brainstem in 1. Strokes in the dominant hemisphere were associated with urinary retention (P = 0.0314), particularly in the area of the insula (P < 0.01).

New information from clinical studies, however, tells us that plasma-phase risk factors, such as factor V Leiden, elevated lipoprotein (a), and mutations in MTHFR, may be important in the pathogenesis of perinatal stroke, if not always in the risk of recurrence. With regard to stroke recurrence, this risk is only about 2% according to the largest follow-up study to date, and certainly less than 5%. Nonetheless, when strokes do recur, they tend to be associated with the presence of plasma-phase risk factors in the affected child, suggesting that a small percentage of children with a first perinatal stroke may benefit from anticoagulation therapy, both to prevent stroke recurrence as well as occurence of a second, non-CNS thrombotic event.

We hypothesized that the yield of code stroke evaluations would be lower in hospitalized than in ED patients, and sought to identify potential targets for quality improvement efforts. Diagnoses and management of in-hospital and ED code stroke patients were assessed retrospectively in a Joint Commission-certified primary stroke center over a 1-year period. A total of 93 in-hospital and 204 ED code strokes were identified during this period. Compared with the ED patients, the hospitalized patients were less likely to have had a stroke/transient ischemic attack (26.8% vs 51.4%; P < .0001) and less likely to have been treated with a thrombolytic agent (odds ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.97: P = .03). Conditions not necessitating immediate neurologic care accounted for 63.4% of in-hospital strokes, compared with 31.3% of ED code strokes (P < .0001).

Each type of stroke is influenced by platelet counts and platelet function. The intention of this article is to discuss the role of the platelet in the pathophysiology of acute stroke processes. This serves as a prelude to discussing these processes as disrupted with thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts).

Because of the unclear time of stroke onset patients with stroke on awakening are usually not considered for acute therapies and excluded from most treatment trials.

Comparing WUS patients and patients with known stroke onset there were no major differences found regarding patient characteristics, etiology, clinical and radiological characteristics. Even though there is no existing gold standard multiparametric neuroimaging (CT; MRI) appears to be helpful for decision making whether to treat a WUS patient with thrombolysis or not. Especially multiparametric MRI which proved to be safe in patients within an extended time window might serve as an adequate diagnostic tool. The results of first pilot studies analyzing treatment of WUS demonstrate that a substantial number of these patients can be treated with IV thrombolysis (IVT) successfully. Large randomized, controlled, prospective clinical trials for patients with WUS are needed to test safety and efficacy of IVT and to evaluate the assumed benefit of multiparametric neuroimaging techniques in this patient group.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17653115/,Left atrial appendage closure for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: state of the art and current challenges,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major risk factor for disabling ischemic strokes. Anticoagulation is highly effective for stroke prevention in patients with AF, but a substantial number of patients are unable to sustain chronic therapy with warfarin. Most strokes in patients with AF are thought to arise from thrombus formation in the left atrial appendage (LAA); therefore, occlusion of the orifice of the LAA provides a theoretically appealing option for stroke prevention. Surgical exclusion of the LAA is increasingly performed in patients undergoing open-heart surgery, and thoracoscopic epicardial occlusion of the LAA has yielded promising early results. Percutaneous LAA occlusion devices have shown some success initial trials, but additional safety and efficacy data are required before this approach can be routinely considered. Here we discuss the LAA in relation to AF-related embolic stroke, and how LAA occlusion devices could be used in stroke prevention in patients who cannot tolerate chronic anticoagulant therapy.",,Tariqshah M Syed;Jonathan L Halperin

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31718504/,"Journal Initiatives to Enhance Preclinical Research: Analyses of Stroke, Nature Medicine, Science Translational Medicine","Background and Purpose- Preclinical research using animals often informs clinical trials. However, its value is dependent on its scientific validity and reproducibility, which are, in turn, dependent on rigorous study design and reporting. In 2011, Stroke introduced a Basic Science Checklist to enhance the reporting and methodology of its preclinical studies. Except for Nature and Science journals, few others have implemented similar initiatives. We sought to estimate the impact of these journal interventions on the quality of their published reports. Methods- All articles published in Stroke, Nature Medicine, and Science Translational Medicine over 9 to 18 years and in 2 control journals without analogous interventions over a corresponding 11.5 years were reviewed to identify reports of experiments in nonhuman mammals with proposed clinical relevance. The effect of journal interventions on the reporting and use of key study design elements was estimated via interrupted time-series analyses. Results- Of 33 009 articles screened, 4162 studies met inclusion criteria. In the 3.5 to 12 years preceding each journal's intervention, the proportions of studies reporting and using key study design elements were stable except for blinding in Stroke and randomization in Science Translational Medicine, which were both increasing. Post-intervention, abrupt and often marked increases were seen in the reporting of randomization status (level change: +17% to +44%, P≤0.005), blinding (level change: +20% to +40%, P≤0.008), and sample size estimation (level change: 0% to +40%, P≤0.002 in 2 journals). Significant but more modest improvements in the use of these study design elements were also observed. These improvements were not seen in control journals. Conclusions- Journal interventions such as Stroke's author submission checklist can meaningfully improve the quality of published preclinical research and should be considered to enhance study transparency and design. However, such interventions are alone insufficient to fully address widespread shortcomings in preclinical research practices.",animal model; bias; biomedical research; research design; sample size.,F Daniel Ramirez;Richard G Jung;Pouya Motazedian;Dylan Perry-Nguyen;Pietro Di Santo;Zachary MacDonald;Aisling A Clancy;Alisha Labinaz;Steven Promislow;Trevor Simard;Steeve Provencher;Sébastien Bonnet;Ian D Graham;George A Wells;Benjamin Hibbert

The authors reviewed records of 111 children who sustained arterial ischemic stroke or sinovenous thrombosis between 2005 and 2010 to identify costs for the following year. They assessed outcomes in 46 with the Recovery and Recurrence Questionnaire and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Neonatal strokes cost less than childhood stroke. Strokes associated with congenital heart disease or vasculopathy cost the most, while perinatal or idiopathic strokes cost the least. Higher costs are correlated with worse impairment and poorer quality of life. Stroke etiology significantly influences the cost of pediatric stroke.

Consecutive patients (n = 1822) with acute ischemic stroke recorded in the Tel Aviv Stroke Register were studied. Stroke during sleep was determined whenever focal neurological deficit was verified to have occurred while the patient had been asleep. The comparisons between patients with stroke during sleep and while awake were performed using the t test with Bonferroni correction and the chi(2) test for age, sex, vascular risk factors (i.e. ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, smoking), vascular distribution (carotid versus vertebrobasilar) and severity of stroke (mild, moderate or severe). Data regarding the onset of stroke (during sleep or while awake) were available for 1,671 patients.

Methods Data were extracted from the Joinville Stroke Registry about all patients who had strokes in Joinville in 2010 and were followed up to 2015. Stroke recurrence, Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities, functional outcomes, and causes of death were ascertained at 30 days, six months, one and five years. Results A total of 399 strokes were studied. The mean age was 64 (standard deviation 16) years. After five years, 52% (95% confidence interval: 47-57%) survived and 20% (95% confidence interval: 15-26%) of the survivors had modified Rankin scale scores >2. More than half of these patients were institutionalized in nursing or home care settings. The average risk of death per year was ≈7%. Survival rates were significantly lower for subarachnoid hemorrhage and primary intracerebral hemorrhage than for ischemic stroke. The five-year recurrence rate was 12% (95% confidence interval: 9-15%). The index stroke was the cause of death in three quarters of the patients. Conclusions The results showed that 68% of the patients with stroke were either dead or disabled five years after first-ever stroke. This percentage is similar to proportions of other recent cohorts from developed countries, despite the lower age of the patients in this study.",Epidemiology; incidence; recurrence; stroke classification; survival.,Norberto L Cabral;Vivian Nagel;Adriana B Conforto;Claudio H Amaral;Vanessa G Venancio;Juliana Safanelli;Felipe Ibiapina;Alexandre L Longo;Viviane de Hiroki F Zetola

There were enrolled in the study 107 patients with acute ischemic strokes. General PSF and certain PSF domains (global, physical, mental, motivational, activity-related) were measured by multidimensional fatigue inventory-20 (MFI-20) scale at hospital stay, in 1, 3 and 6 months after stroke occurrence. Brain MRI studies included cerebral infarct localization, planimetric measurements of infarct volumes, measurement of brain atrophy indexes (bifrontal, bicaudate, cortical atrophy indexes, width of third ventricle) and evaluation of leukoaraiosis severity, according to Fazekas scale. In univariate logistic regression analysis infarcts volumes as well as brain atrophy indexes were not significantly associated with risk of any PSF domain at any time points within first 6 months after ischemic strokes. On the other hand, it had been found reliable associations between subcortical infarcts and increased risk of PSF domains which are related just to physical activity (physical PSF, activity-related PSF) in 1 month after stroke onset and later, as well as reliable associations between infratentorial infarcts and risk of global PSF domain in 3 months after stroke and later. Moreover, it have been revealed significant direct associations between severity of white matter lesions and risk of mental PSF in 3 months after stroke onset and later. Subcortical infarcts may be risk factors for development of physical PSF domain, infratentorial infarcts - risk factors for development of global PSF domain, leukoaraiosis extension - risk factor for development of mental PSF domain but not early than 1 month after stroke occurrence.",,M Delva;I Delva

METHODS Historical analysis using health policy documents, published papers and correspondence on stroke alongside 17 interviews with stroke clinicians and managers in the UK and the US. RESULTS The challenges of implementation stemmed from organisational and professional barriers rather than scientific or technological difficulties. Stroke's historical status as a non-treatable illness was a barrier to the adoption of acute treatments. Building new pathways for stroke patients by developing protocols for paramedics and emergency room staff originated as a local solution to a local problem but were taken up widely. DISCUSSION Understanding the clinical response to the reconceptualisation of stroke as a treatable disease contributes to our understandings of the relations between clinical research and practice. These findings have implications for how we understand the translation of new knowledge into practice and its transfer across different clinical communities and settings. Protocols are shown to be a particularly valuable tool, bridging knowledge between communities and manifesting a new identity for stroke.",Stroke; emergency medicine; evidence-based medicine; knowledge transfer; thrombolysis.,Stephanie J Snow

We conducted a retrospective analysis based on data prospectively collected from 876 consecutive adult ischemic stroke patients who were directly admitted to the Stroke Unit of the University Hospital of Verona within 12 h of stroke onset. A theoretical model was created to calculate the proportion of patients potentially eligible for revascularization treatments. In our cohort, 289 (33%) patients would be eligible for IVT alone, 193 (22%) for combined IVT and ET, and 39 (4%) for direct ET with level of evidence IA according to the current guidelines. According to our theoretical model, more than half of the ischemic stroke patients directly admitted to Verona Stroke Unit within 12 h of stroke onset would be eligible for IVT and more than a quarter for ET.

This study investigated shortened dosage schedules of DDFPe in nonstandard posterior (NSTND) strokes following occlusions of the posterior cerebral arteries. DDFPe given at shortened schedules of 30 or 60-min injection intervals will reduce neurological deficits, percent stroke volume (%SV), and serum glutamate levels in NSTND ischemic strokes. New Zealand White rabbits (N = 26) were randomly placed into three groups: A (n = 9) controls given saline injections every 60 min, B (n = 9) 2 % DDFPe given IV every 30 min, and C (n = 8) DDFPe every 60 min. Injections began 1 h after embolization. Groups were subdivided into STND and NSTND based on angiographically verified embolization of the cerebral arteries. Neurological assessments and blood samples were done at 0.5-1-h intervals. Rabbits were euthanized at 7 h following embolization. Stained brain slices were measured for %SV. The 30 and 60-min subgroups did not differ and were combined as DDFPe-STND or DDFPe-NSTND groups. In the DDFPe-STND stroke group, the %SV, neurological assessment scores (NAS), and serum glutamate were decreased vs. STND controls (p = 0.0016, 0.008, and 0.016, respectively). In the DDFPe-NSTND stroke group, %SV, NAS, and serum glutamate did not differ statistically compared to NSTND controls (p = 0.82, 0.097, and 0.06, respectively).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22075728/,Characteristics of spinal cord stroke in clinical neurology,"Spinal cord stroke accounts for about 0.3% of all strokes in our department. Thirty-two patients (15 males, 17 females; mean age 63.3 years) treated in the period 1995-2010 were included. Patients underwent thorough investigation including the use of different stroke scales (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, Barthel Index and modified Rankin Scale). Twenty-eight patients had infarctions, 3 had hemorrhages, and 1 had arterio-venous fistula. Twenty-eight spinal cord strokes were spontaneous, 2 were secondary to aorta aneurysms, and 2 post surgery. Biphasic ictus was seen in 17% of all spontaneous infarctions. Younger age, male gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and higher blood glucose on admission regardless of diabetes mellitus, were risk factors associated with more severe spinal cord stroke. Treatment and prevention of these risk factors should be essential in spinal cord stroke. We recommend a clinical classification into upper (cervical) and lower (thoracic or medullary conus) spinal cord strokes. Patients with upper strokes in this study had more severe strokes initially, but they had a better prognosis. Therefore it is important to identify this patient group.Acute sensory spinal cord deficit symptoms, common initial symptoms in biphasic spinal cord strokes, should be considered as possible spinal cord stroke, especially when preceded by radiating pain between the shoulders.",,Fredrik Romi;Halvor Naess

(online video available at: http://education.amjmed.com/video.php?event_id=445&stage_id=5&vcs=1). The principal risk with AFib, stroke or thrombotic embolism, is increased 5-fold in some series; AFib accounts for ≥15% of all strokes in the United States, 36% of strokes for individuals aged >80, and up to 20% of cryptogenic strokes, which means >100,000-125,000 embolic strokes per year, of which >20% are fatal. Patients with ischemic stroke and AFib are significantly (P<.0005) more likely to be chronically disabled, bedridden, and to require constant nursing care, particularly older patients (≥85 years). Prevention of these thromboembolic outcomes requires prophylactic anticoagulation therapy. The ""gold standard"" for anticoagulation has been warfarin, despite its well-known side effects and adherence challenges for patients. The recent approvals of several new, novel oral anticoagulation (NOAC) agents, however, presents physicians with a benefit/risk profile that represents an important advance over warfarin prophylaxis. The principal risk with all oral anticoagulants is bleeding. An important misconception about warfarin is that if anticoagulated patients bleed, the risk can be quickly reversed, but most trial experience has found that warfarin reversal requires 24 hours to halve the INR value. Reversal of anticoagulation with the NOACs is unproven at present; possible approaches are presented in this review, but since the NOACs have both rapid onsets of action and short biologic half-lives, they do not present the same reversal challenges as warfarin. Finally, physicians must be aware of thromboembolic risk assessment. The principal risk assessment scores are CHADS2, updated with the more recent CHA2DS2-VASc to provide more accurate assessment of low-risk patients; this review concludes with a novel flow-chart showing physicians how the CHADS2/CHA2DS2-VASc scoring systems can be used.",,James A Reiffel

Data of 148 patients with isolated capsular stroke were collected from a prospective hospital-based stroke registry in which 2000 consecutive acute stroke patients were included. Isolated capsular stroke accounted for 8.4% of strokes included in the registry (8.4% of ischemic strokes and 10.5% of intracerebral hemorrhages). Capsular stroke of hemorrhagic origin (n = 24) was more severe than ischemic capsular stroke (n = 124) as determined by a significantly higher in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and lower number of patients free of functional deficit at discharge. After multivariate analysis, limb weakness, sudden onset, and sensory symptoms were independently associated with capsular hemorrhage, whereas pure motor hemiparesis appeared to be associated with capsular infarction. In summary, one of each 12 patients with acute ischemic stroke and one of each 10 patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage had an isolated capsular stroke. Lacunar syndrome was the most frequent clinical presentation being more common (particularly pure motor hemiparesis) in ischemic than in hemorrhagic capsular stroke.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29458299/,The feasibility and effectiveness of using prism adaptation to treat motor and spatial dysfunction in stroke survivors with multiple incidents of stroke,"Background Strokes resulting in cognitive and motor problems can be debilitating and prolong recovery. Risk of a second stroke occurs for 40% of all first-time stroke survivors within five years. Prism adaptation treatment (PAT) may simultaneously improve functions of both spatial and motor systems. This has not been studied with a cohort comprised of multiple strokes nor measured change using specific motor outcomes. Objectives To determine the feasibility and effectiveness of using PAT to improve spatial and motor functions in stroke survivors with multiple strokes. Method A prospective intervention with retrospective comparison. Thirteen participants from an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) comprised the treatment group; 13 others who only received standard care comprised the comparison group. Treatment group tested on: 4 motor and 3 spatial outcome measures before and after the 10 PAT sessions. The comparison group tested on: 1 motor and 3 spatial measures before and after standard care. Results Thirteen participants successfully completed the PAT. Both groups improved on measures of spatial neglect over time (p < .001), but the treatment group showed greater improvement on two subtests of spatial function (Behavior inattention test) (p = .001 & p = .002). Similarly, both groups improved in motor function (Functional independence measure) (p < .001), although the treatment group's improvement was not statistically significant against the comparison group (p = .853).

Based on clinical and CT data, we distinguished infratentorial strokes from supratentorial strokes (lacunar infarctions, (sub)cortical infarctions and intracerebral hemorrhages). Cumulative mortality for all stroke patients was 34% at 6 months, 51% at 3 years, and 62% at 5 years. Short-term mortality could be explained by stroke type, whereas long-term mortality could not. Of all survivors, 55% were in poor functional health at 6 months, 49% at 3 years and 42% at 5 years. Long-term functional health outcomes were associated with stroke type.

If we would decrease the enormous burden of stroke throughout the world, we first need to know the barriers that we have to overcome. These are quite similar to the barriers that we have tried to surmount during the last 25 years. STOKE PREVENTION: We have developed many successful primary and secondary therapies to prevent stroke over the past 25 years and have begun to understand some of the genetic risk factors underlying stroke. Yet, the incidence rate of stroke in Rochester, Minn, remained unchanged from 1975 to the mid-1990s, and mortality rates for Ohio have changed little for men, women, blacks, and whites over the past decade. The primary reason that we have made little progress in decreasing the burden of stroke is that we have made little progress in modifying the primary risk factors for stroke in the population. Other barriers of improved stroke prevention in the future include costs of therapy and aging of blood vessels and brain, which is the most important risk factor for stroke.",,Joseph P Broderick

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15871059/,[Atrial fibrillation as a relevant risk factor for stroke],"Atrial fibrillation, one of the most frequent heart rhythm disturbances and the most common source of embolic material in cerebral circulation, is associated with a fivefold increased risk of ischemic stroke. Except thromboembolic complications, atrial fibrillation affects hemodynamic activity of the heart, reduces cardiac output and might decrease cerebral blood flow. It is possible that atrial fibrillation disturbs autoregulation mechanisms of cerebral circulation in patients suffering from an acute stroke. This could be the reason of higher early mortality and more severe clinical outcome versus strokes in patients with the sinus rhythm. An ongoing increase of population with atrial fibrillation is observed. Such patients often need intensive antithrombotic prevention with oral anticoagulants. Worldwide prescribing effective anticoagulant therapy is insufficient in relation to the needs. The leading reason underlying the under-utilization of oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation is the lack of knowledge about importance of this kind of stroke prevention and fear of bleeding among doctors, particularly among general practitioners.",,Agata Porebska;Przemysław Nowacki

Social isolation leads to higher rates of recurrent stroke but is often not reported as a risk factor. We examined prospectively collected stroke center database variables, which included prestroke living situation, to determine if social isolation could be determined from existing data using living arrangement as a proxy. Patients were categorized into 4 groups hypothesized to represent increasing levels of social isolation: living with spouse, living with family, living alone with visiting services, and living alone. Initial stroke severity and recovery were measured using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Barthel Index, respectively. A multivariate model was used to determine the relationship among prestroke living situation, stroke severity, and functional outcome. Patients living alone had less severe strokes on admission and better recovery at 3 months compared with the other cohorts. Patients living alone or those who lived with a spouse had less severe strokes on presentation and better recovery at both 3 and 12 months after stroke compared with the other cohorts. However, on detailed examination, it was found that these patients also had significantly higher prestroke function. Pre-existing depression was significantly higher in women, and depressed patients had poorer outcomes 3 months after stroke. Information regarding isolation is notably absent from most large stroke databases.

We compared the initial and recurrent lesion patterns on diffusion-weighted MRI in patients with OLCA-stroke, with respect to vascular territory involved, number and size of lesions, clinical presentation, cancer subtypes, recurrences and fatalities, and outcome of survivors. Thirteen patients with confirmed OLCA-stroke were identified. All had elevated D-dimer levels, six had central lung cancer and seven had peripheral lung cancer. Eight (62%) had adenocarcinoma, and nine (69%) had metastasis. Ten (77%) patients had multiple lesions in multiple vascular territories. Twelve (92%) patients suffered recurrent strokes. Multiple small and large disseminated lesions in multiple vascular territories were more frequent in recurrent strokes in comparison with initial strokes. The middle cerebral artery was most frequently involved in recurrent strokes, followed by the posterior circulation territory and anterior cerebral artery, which were of similar frequency as initial strokes. Overall, 58% of patients had their first recurrent stroke within the first month, and 69% had a poor outcome, especially for those with multiple recurrent strokes and metastases.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16814938/,"A new theory of cryptogenic stroke and its relationship to patent foramen ovale; or, the puzzle of the missing extra risk","Cryptogenic stroke (or stroke of undetermined cause) is a common cause of stroke and is statistically associated with patent foramen ovale (PFO). The largest study of cryptogenic stroke is the Homma study, which is a sub-study of the WARSS trial; it produced the following data: cryptogenic stroke patients with and without PFO, when treated with either aspirin or warfarin, all had identical recurrence rates. This is puzzling because it seems as though there ought to have been some extra risk in one of the two groups under one of the two treatments. How could everything come out the same? A review of the epidemiology of cryptogenic stroke shows that, compared to patients with stroke of determined cause, cryptogenic stroke patients are a little younger and have lower doses of the usual risk factors (hypertension and diabetes mellitus) but more PFO. Cryptogenic strokes appear to be embolic strokes from an unknown source. A previously published article setting forth a hypothetical theory of stress-induced stroke was used to analyze these data. It is suggested that stress can induce episodic systemic platelet activation and hypercoagulability, which causes transient thrombus formation and subsequent embolization on both the arterial and venous sides of the circulation; the latter requires a PFO to cause a stroke (paradoxical embolism). The sum of these two mechanisms explains cryptogenic stroke. The PFO subset of cryptogenic stroke includes patients with both early and late stage disease who have an aggregate risk approximately equal to that of patients without PFO. Cryptogenic stroke is part of the disease of stress-induced cerebrovascular disease. Aspirin and warfarin have already been shown to be equally effective in secondary prevention of ischemic stroke.",,Arnold E Eggers

Twenty-one children with neonatal (mean age, 6.86 years) and 10 children with childhood (mean age, 8.21 years) strokes, identified via the Estonian Pediatric Stroke Database (1995-2006), participated. A developmental neuropsychologic assessment was used for neurocognitive outcomes, and the Paediatric Stroke Outcome Measure for neurologic outcomes. Neuromotor impairment was evident in 62% of children with neonatal strokes, and in 70% of children with childhood strokes. Compared with control subjects, children with strokes exhibited worse attention, language, memory, and sensorimotor functions. The sensorimotor domain comprised the most impaired neurocognitive area, whereas executive functions remained intact in both stroke groups. A well-preserved executive function may account for the normal range of intelligence in children with strokes. More severe impairment in neurocognitive skills was evident after neonatal strokes, and the visuospatial domain was more impaired than in children from the childhood group.

Despite these methodological difficulties, it does appear that the overall prognosis with respect to survival and residual disability is similar to that for ischaemic stroke of equivalent clinical severity. Greater age and stroke severity, whether graded by neurological score or extent of haemorrhage on imaging, are both associated with increased case fatality and poorer functional outcomes. There is no definite evidence of differential recovery between ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke. Epileptic seizures occur more commonly after haemorrhagic stroke (about 8 per 100 patient-years) compared with ischaemic stroke and more commonly in lobar rather than basal ganglia haemorrhage. There is no reliable evidence to indicate that the risk of recurrent stroke after haemorrhage differs from that after ischaemic stroke. However, strokes due to haemorrhage, like those due to infarction, are heterogeneous not only in terms of severity but also in their causes. The causes (e.g. amyloid angiopathy, hypertension, coagulation deficits) are likely to influence the risk of subsequent stroke. Pooling of data from community-based studies of haemorrhagic stroke that have used consistent definitions and methods represents the only feasible way to obtain more precise data on prognosis after intracerebral haemorrhage.",,Martin S Dennis

Given stroke's effect on survivors and the accompanying burden on caregivers, attention should be given to addressing the needs of caregivers of stroke survivors because they are central to supporting survivors living in the community. Research has shown that the information needs of caregivers are not being met across healthcare settings. Thus, some attention must be given to the development of educational materials that address caregiver needs. In this study we interviewed caregivers to determine their perspectives on support and educational needs at two different stages in the recovery of the stroke survivor: the acute hospital and the community. Despite a high level of uncertainty among caregivers in the acute and community settings, limited information was provided to assist them in their new role. A multifaceted approach would involve the development and implementation of specifically designed educational materials for caregivers; the use of a tool such as a patient-held record to assist in and improve the continuity and communication of care, and the provision of ongoing support from a stroke nurse practitioner who would follow stroke survivors from the acute setting to the community.

Thanks in part to better and more available diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation, the vast majority of stroke patients tend to survive strokes, particularly in the industrialized world. Motor disability and cognitive changes such as aphasia and visuospatial disorders are most often considered among the major contributors to stroke burden. This chapter discusses disorders of sexual functions as another frequent sequel of strokes. Strokes generally induce hyposexuality, but in some instances they may be followed by hypersexuality. There is some evidence suggesting that lesions of either hemisphere affect sexual activities, but for different reasons: aphasia and depression after left-hemisphere lesions, a deficit in arousal and perhaps visuospatial disorders after right-hemisphere lesions. Psychologic, psychosocial, and physical factors, as well as medications, play an important role. A better understanding of the psychosocial and physiologic mechanisms underlying sexual functioning can provide insight into improving sexual activity and therefore quality of life in patients affected by strokes and other brain lesions.",correlation between coitus and stroke; drugs; hypersexuality; hyposexuality; risk factors; strokes.,François Boller;Kunal Agrawal;Alissa Romano
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11641298/,Stroke prognosis and abnormal nocturnal blood pressure falls in older hypertensives,"It remains uncertain whether abnormal dipping patterns of nocturnal blood pressure influence the prognosis for stroke. We studied stroke events in 575 older Japanese patients with sustained hypertension determined by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (without medication). They were subclassified by their nocturnal systolic blood pressure fall (97 extreme-dippers, with >/=20% nocturnal systolic blood pressure fall; 230 dippers, with >/=10% but <20% fall; 185 nondippers, with >/=0% but <10% fall; and 63 reverse-dippers, with <0% fall) and were followed prospectively for an average duration of 41 months. Baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disclosed that the percentages with multiple silent cerebral infarct were 53% in extreme-dippers, 29% in dippers, 41% in nondippers, and 49% in reverse-dippers. There was a J-shaped relationship between dipping status and stroke incidence (extreme-dippers, 12%; dippers, 6.1%; nondippers, 7.6%; and reverse-dippers, 22%), and this remained significant in a Cox regression analysis after controlling for age, gender, body mass index, 24-hour systolic blood pressure, and antihypertensive medication. Intracranial hemorrhage was more common in reverse-dippers (29% of strokes) than in other subgroups (7.7% of strokes, P=0.04). In the extreme-dipper group, 27% of strokes were ischemic strokes that occurred during sleep (versus 8.6% of strokes in the other 3 subgroups, P=0.11). In conclusion, in older Japanese hypertensive patients, extreme dipping of nocturnal blood pressure may be related to silent and clinical cerebral ischemia through hypoperfusion during sleep or an exaggerated morning rise of blood pressure, whereas reverse dipping may pose a risk for intracranial hemorrhage.",,K Kario;T G Pickering;T Matsuo;S Hoshide;J E Schwartz;K Shimada

Impact on the treatment decision],"The development of several population stroke registries has improved our knowledge of the epidemiology of strokes, their natural history, and their trends over time and place. In Europe, stroke incidence decreases from east to west and from north to south. Incidence and mortality have also been decreasing regularly over time. The diagnostic tools created with the arrival of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and other forms of vascular and cardiac imaging have improved the identification of risk factors for stroke according to its mechanism--hemorrhagic or ischemic--and according to the subtype of ischemic stroke. Hypertension is the leading risk factor for both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. New independent stroke risk factors have been confirmed, including elevated cholesterol and homocysteine levels. The regular decline of the incidence of some types of stroke and of mortality is partly due to the positive effects of prevention and confirms the usefulness of screening and early treatment of stroke risk factors. Development of new treatments during the acute phase and in the field of primary and secondary stroke prevention (such as statins) is necessary to improve prognosis, which remains too serious, especially in women.",,Yannick Bejot;Marie Caillier;Olivier Rouaud;Isabelle Benatru;Cécile Maugras;Guy-Victor Osseby;Maurice Giroud

However, traditional neuropsychological tests have limitations with this population due to required verbal response, complex motor response, and lengthy administration time. This study examined the ecological validity and performance characteristics of a relatively new measure of executive function, the Brixton Spatial Anticipation Test, which does not place the aforementioned demands on these patients. A total of 57 ischemic stroke patients with frontal lobe and subcortical lesions were administered the Brixton, on average 2 weeks post-stroke, during inpatient rehabilitation and assessed using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) upon discharge. Brixton performance was significantly correlated with the FIM Total and FIM Cognitive Subtotal at discharge but unrelated to FIM Motor Subtotal. After controlling for global ability measured by the RBANS, Brixton performance accounted for additional variance in predicting FIM Total score at discharge. Interestingly, patients with subcortical strokes in the thalamus and basal ganglia performed significantly worse than patients with strokes in the frontal cortex on the Brixton, supporting the role of subcortical structures in the frontal lobe circuitry and executive function. Based on the present findings, the Brixton is a sensitive measure conducive to the stroke population and has strong ecological validity for identifying cognitive functional outcomes post-stroke.",,Jessica A Vordenberg;John J Barrett;Nicholas A Doninger;Christopher P Contardo;Kingsley A Ozoude
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15703904/,TCD in sickle cell disease: an important and useful test,"Sickle cell disease is associated with a high risk of stroke in the early years of childhood. The risk of a secondary stroke can be significantly reduced through chronic blood transfusions. Prevention of the first stroke (primary prevention) was made possible through the use of transcranial Doppler (TCD) US and demonstrated in a randomized clinical trial called the stroke prevention trial in sickle cell anemia (STOP). TCD results were classified as normal, conditional, abnormal or inadequate based on velocity readings in specific arterial segments. The MCA and ICA were carefully searched to find the highest velocity, and this was used to stratify patients as to stroke risk. Those with abnormal or high-risk TCD received either monthly blood transfusions or no transfusions, and those randomized to transfusion had a much better outcome in terms of stroke (one stroke, versus ten in the control group) and also fewer other medical problems while transfused. TCD screening is recommended for SCD patients to begin at 24 months of age and should be repeated every 6-12 months during early childhood. Transcranial Doppler imaging (TCDI) can be easier to use and learn and with a few adjustments can provide equivalent predictive power. Currently, TCD is the only recommended method for treatment selection for primary-stroke prevention. MRI and MRA can provide important information on the status of the brain and the blood vessels and, when abnormal, indicate greater risk. Although TCD cannot predict all strokes, TCD and TCDI offer an opportunity to apply an effective therapy for patients in this risk group and reduce many first-time strokes.",,Robert J Adams

Clinical data and brain images were analyzed. Ischemic strokes at high altitudes were characterized by younger ages (69.14 ± 11.10 vs. 64.44 ± 11.50 vs. 64.45 ± 14.03, p < 0.001) and larger infract volumes (8436.37 ± 29,615.07 mm3 vs. 17,213.16 ± 47,044.74 mm3 vs. 42,459 ± 84,529.83 mm3, p < 0.001).

It is unclear which antithrombotic regimen should be used to reduce the risk of stroke. We systematically reviewed the literature on all types of antithrombotic regimens and stroke in patients with any type of LVADs. Our primary outcome measure was the mean incidence of any type of stroke. Twenty-six articles were selected as relevant, comprehending 1989 patients with a mean LVAD support of 200 days (range 30-621). The mean proportion of patients affected with stroke was 20% (range 0-55%), with a mean incidence of 0.74 (range 0-6.91) events/patient-year. Support with HeartMate II and a regimen of postoperative heparin converted to coumarins, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and dipyridamole resulted in 0.17 (mean; range 0.06-0.29) strokes/patient-year. HeartMate II support and the same regime without heparin was associated with 0.07 (mean; range 0.03-0.11) strokes/patient-year.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21901449/,Cervical collaterals may protect against stroke after blunt vertebral artery injury,"The incidence of ischemic stroke reported after blunt vertebral artery injury is lower than that reported after blunt carotid artery injury. Unlike the carotid arteries, the vertebral arteries receive collateral blood flow through ascending cervical branches in addition to a convergent arterial supply with the contralateral vertebral artery. We hypothesize that the incidence of stroke after vertebral artery injury is less than after carotid artery injury in part because of reconstitution of vertebral arteries by cervical collaterals. A retrospective blinded interpretation of angiographic studies in 46 patients with blunt vertebral injury was performed to assess for presence and grade of vertebral artery injury and for the presence of reconstitution of the vessel via cervical collaterals. Follow-up CT scans from the same patients were evaluated for the presence of posterior circulation strokes. There were 55 injured vertebral arteries in the 46 patients, of whom 8 experienced posterior fossa strokes. Two-tailed Fisher exact probability test evaluating the hypothesis that patients with vertebral artery collaterals were less likely to experience posterior fossa strokes reached significance, p < 0.05. Of patients with occlusive (grades IV and V) injuries, those with collateral vessels were significantly less likely to experience posterior fossa strokes (p < 0.01). This result may be considered when weighing the potential risks and benefits of antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy in patients with occlusive blunt vertebral artery injury.",,Kathleen R Fink;James R Fink;Wendy A Cohen

Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and mechanical thrombectomy comprise the two major treatments for acute ischemic stroke. Tissue plasminogen activator has been used for more than two decades and guidelines for hemodynamic management following tissue plasminogen activator administration are well established. However, mechanical thrombectomy is a relatively newer therapy and there is a paucity of evidence regarding hemodynamic management following large vessel occlusion strokes. The important tenets guiding the pathophysiology of large vessel occlusion strokes include understanding of cerebral autoregulation, collateral circulation, and blood pressure variability. In this narrative review, we discuss the current American Heart Association-American Stroke Association guidelines for the early management of acute ischemic stroke during different phases of the illness, encountered at different sections of a hospital including the emergency room, the neuro-interventional suite, and the intensive care unit. There is emerging evidence with regard to post-recanalization blood pressure management following large vessel occlusion strokes. Future research directions will include rea-ltime blood pressure variability assessments, identifying the extent of impaired autoregulation, and providing guidelines related to range and personalized blood pressure trajectories for patients following large vessel occlusion strokes.","Blood pressure variability; cerebral autoregulation; endovascular thrombectomy; hypertension; ischemic stroke; large vessel occlusion,; mechanical thrombectomy; perfusion; recanalization.",Saurav Das;Kevin Denny John;Satheesh Kumar Bokka;Kerri Remmel;Ozan Akça
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25616533/,Usefulness of the CHA2DS2VASc score to predict postoperative stroke in patients having cardiac surgery independent of atrial fibrillation,"Despite its association with cardioembolic stroke, atrial fibrillation (AF) appears to be inconsistent as a risk factor for postoperative strokes in patients who underwent cardiac surgery. Furthermore, the relation between AF and the CHA2DS2VASc score has not been definitively established with respect to postoperative stroke. We retrospectively analyzed the records of all cardiac surgery performed at our institution between January 2008 and July 2013. Baseline characteristics, operative data, and postoperative outcomes were compared in patients who developed stroke with those who did not. Previously recognized stroke risk factors, including AF, were analyzed along with the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2VASc scores. A total of 3,492 consecutive patients were identified, of which 2,077 (60%) underwent valve surgery, 915 (26%) had coronary artery bypass grafting, 399 (11%) underwent combined coronary artery bypass grafting and valve procedures, and 101 (3%) had other cardiac operations. Postoperative ischemic strokes occurred in 44 patients (1.2%). The development of a stroke was associated with older age (74 ± 12 vs 69 ± 12, p = 0.008), preoperative antiplatelet medication use (38.6% vs 24.5%, p = 0.043), congestive heart failure (37% vs 20%, p = 0.002), and greater CHADS2 (2.48 ± 1.3 vs 1.98 ± 1.1, p = 0.015) and CHA2DS2VASc scores (4.2 ± 1.8 vs 3.4 ± 1.6, p = 0.002). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that the CHA2DS2VASc score was the only independent predictor of postoperative strokes (odds ratio 1.25; 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.5, p = 0.014).

The diagnoses were intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH; 30, 8.8%), cardioembolic cerebral infarction (CE, 71, 20.9%), lacunar infarction (LI; 47, 13.9%) and atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (ACI; 191, 56.3%). The cumulative probabilities of recurrent stroke rates at 1-, 5- and 10-year follow-ups were 13.5% (95% confidence interval, CI, 9.6-17.4), 38.7% (95% CI 32.6-44.8) and 53.9% (95% CI 46.7-61.1). According to Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, age, severity of stroke, previous stroke and systolic blood pressure are each of importance in predicting recurrent stroke. During the observation period, 290 patients (85.5%) died. The mortality rate of 24.5% during the first year was 4.5 times higher compared to the normal population of the same age and gender. Patients with LI had lower mortality rates compared to ICH by the log rank test (p = 0.0275); to CE (p = 0.000) and to ACI (p = 0.049). Thirty-nine percent of all vascular deaths after the first year were caused by recurrent strokes. Fatal index/recurrent stroke occurred statistically more frequently in the CE group versus the non-CE one (p = 0.005). Cox proportional hazard regression analysis indicated that age, severity of stroke, previous stroke, heart failure and fasting blood glucose exceeding 6 mmol/l or history of diabetes were each predictors of mortality.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11447428/,Ischaemic strokes: management in first six hours,"Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) or stroke is one of the foremost causes of high morbidity and mortality for many nations of the world, posing a major socio-economic challenge in the occupational and neuro-rehabilitational programmes of the 'stroke-survivors'. For example, in USA alone it has been estimated that a sum of 3261 million dollars is spent as direct cost for treatment, in addition to 4104 million dollars as indirect costs, consequent on economic losses of 'stroke victims'. Thus, the new concept in stroke pathophysiology and strategies for stroke prevention have assumed global importance. Among all risk factors for strokes, hypertension is one of the most important and treatable factor. Community screening surveys, by well defined WHO protocol, have shown that nearly 15% of urban population is hypertensive (160/95 mm Hg or more). Though high blood pressure has the highest attributable risk for stroke, there are many other reasons such as patient's compliance in taking medicine and poor followup in clinical practice that may lead to failure in reducing stroke mortality. In subjects, who have transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs), regular use of antiplatelet agents like aspirin is well established in prevention of stroke. It is also mandatory to prohibit tobacco use and adjust dietary habits to control body weight. Associated conditions like diabetes mellitus etc. should also be treated. It is advisable to initiate community screening surveys on well defined populations for early detection of hypertension and TIAs. Primary health care centres should be the base stations for these surveys, because data gathered from urban hospitals will not truly reflect the crude prevalence rates for the community to design practical prevention programmes.",,P M Dalal

The object of research is the distribution of these TOAST categories in a demographically defined population and their impact on the need of care. The present study involves patients recruited within the population-based Erlangen Stroke Project (ESPro). The patients were analysed at time points after admission as well as 3 and 12 month after the event. results were presented as adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR). 1355 patients with a first-ever-in-a-lifetime ischemic stroke were registered in the Community of Erlangen. TOAST classification could be performed in 89 % (1206) of ischemic strokes. The etiological classification of brain infarctions resulted in 12 % large-artery atherosclerosis, 26 % cardioembolism, 24 % small-artery occlusion, 37 % strokes of undetermined etiology and 2 % strokes of other determined etiology. While 20 % of the patients were independent functionally at the Barthel index at admission, the number was 39 % after 12 month.

Velocity in the middle cerebral or distal internal carotid artery as measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasound is a recognized method to identify children but not adults with SCA at high-risk for first stroke. For both children and adults with SCA that have had a stroke, no methods clearly identify individuals at highest risk of recurrent strokes or an initial silent stroke, the most common neurological injury. Methods to assess cerebral hemodynamics in SCA have been utilized for decades but often required radiotracers making them not feasible for screening and longitudinal follow-up. MRI approaches that do not require exogenous contrast have been introduced and are appealing in both clinical and research scenarios. Improved neuroimaging strategies hold promise for identifying individuals with SCA at increased risk of initial and recurrent infarcts, justifying more aggressive risk-based therapy. We review the epidemiology of stroke in SCA, the impact of strokes, stroke mechanisms, and potential imaging strategies including regional and global oxygen extraction fraction, cerebral blood flow, and vessel wall imaging to identify individuals at high-risk of stroke.",Arterial spin labelling; brain imaging; cerebral hemodynamics; cognitive impairment; hematology; lacunar infarcts; stroke.,Lori C Jordan;Michael R DeBaun

There are many clinical practice guidelines with strong levels of evidence that address the secondary prophylaxis of strokes. The Post-Stroke Rehabilitation Outcomes Project (PSROP) database was used to describe the frequency that antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant medications are prescribed for the secondary prophylaxis of a stroke. Of the 1,161 participants in the PSROP, 890 (76.66%) had nonhemorrhagic strokes. Of the participants with nonhemorrhagic strokes, 169 (18.99%) did not receive any antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication. Of 717 participants who did not have an embolic event, 140 (19.5%) did not receive a salicylate, antiplatelet agent, or warfarin. Of 173 participants who had an embolic event, 29 (16.8%) did not receive a salicylate, antiplatelet agent, or warfarin. Unless patients have any medical contraindications to these medications, they should receive these evidence-based treatments for secondary stroke prophylaxis.

Stroke severity is reported to be less severe than cardioembolic stroke and similar to large-artery atherosclerosis. Because its etiology is believed to be mostly an embolic type, it is often called ""embolic strokes of undetermined source"" (ESUS). In patients with ESUS, it is of significant importance to seek an embolic source with intensive diagnostic assessment, which mostly originates from the heart. Covert atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial high-rate episodes (AHRE) detected by cardiac implantable electronic devices are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of ESUS. AHRE is common not only in device-implanted patients, but also in older patients with cardiovascular risk factors. However, it is unclear whether AHRE is a direct cause or simply a risk marker of stroke. Furthermore, indication of anticoagulation therapy for stroke prevention in patients with AHRE remains undetermined. In this review, we focus on the roles of covert AF and AHRE in the pathogenesis of cryptogenic ischemic stroke or ESUS.

This raised concerns about the predictive validity of preclinical studies in animals for outcomes in human stroke trials. To bridge this translational gap, we used high-order gyrencephalic nonhuman primates subjected to an experimental protocol that mimicked that of a corresponding, separately reported, clinical trial in which the human subjects underwent endovascular cerebral aneurysm repair. Both placebo-controlled studies tested neuroprotection by Tat-NR2B9c, a prospective therapeutic compound, in anesthetized subjects. Embolic strokes were produced by small intra-arterial emboli caused by the endovascular procedure. We show that primates treated with Tat-NR2B9c after the onset of embolic strokes exhibited significantly reduced numbers and volumes of strokes, as visualized by diffusion- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. These results correctly anticipated the outcome of the corresponding human trial, thus validating this study design as a predictor of neuroprotective efficacy in humans. This strategy may facilitate the evaluation of promising neuroprotectants before undertaking similar studies in human subjects.",,Douglas J Cook;Lucy Teves;Michael Tymianski

Until recently, the only available management intervention was the use of chronic transfusions to prevent stroke recurrence. The stroke prevention trial in sickle cell anemia (STOP) demonstrated that children at risk for strokes can be identified by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography. In high-risk patients, the risk of first stroke can be decreased by 90% if patients are placed on chronic transfusion regimens. However, transfusing all patients with abnormal TCD is also problematic; as many as 60% do not seem to develop a stroke. At this time, a more precise stratification of stroke risk based on imaging studies, genetic studies, and neuropsychological testing is needed. Moreover, the development of alternatives to chronic transfusions, such as hydroxyurea and other pharmacologic therapies, may also improve the outlook for patients at high risk for stroke.",,Miguel R Abboud;George F Atweh

Stroke in young individuals poses a major health problem. The WHO defines stroke as an event caused by the interruption of the blood supply to the brain, usually because of rupture of a blood vessel or blockage by a clot. This hampers the supply of oxygen and nutrients, causing damage to the brain tissue. Globally, stroke is the third commonest cause of mortality and the fourth leading cause of disease burden. Ischaemic stroke is the most common cerebrovascular disease, most often due to atherothrombotic diseases and uncommonly by disorders of hypercoagulation. Disorders of coagulation leading to thrombotic disorders are approximately 1% of all ischaemic strokes and 4-8% of strokes in young individuals. Similarly, combined deficiency of proteins C and S can lead to hypercoagulable state and rarely presents as a cerebrovascular accident.

After performing a CT angiography, which showed complete basilar occlusion, we determined the MR DWI-FLAIR mismatch to estimate the stroke onset time. Because of the favorable mismatch (DWI hyperintensity in the left pons, no FLAIR hyperintensity in the same region), the patient underwent thrombolysis with sudden neurological improvement. In addition, the DWI hyperintensity first observed in the left pons totally regressed after thrombolysis. Wake-up stroke constitutes about 14 % of all strokes, while the percentage of basilar artery occlusion wake-up strokes is still unknown. Although thrombolysis in patients with unknown-onset time is still an off-label therapy, basilar artery occlusion is a potentially fatal event.

The standard of care for typical strokes does not apply to infective endocarditis because there is a substantial risk of hemorrhage with thrombolysis. In the last decade there have been multiple case reports of intravenous and intraarterial thrombolysis with successful outcomes for acute strokes with related infective endocarditis, but successful endovascular interventions for acute strokes associated with infective endocarditis are rarely reported. To the authors' knowledge, this report is the first case in the literature to use a mechanical retrieval device in successful vegetation retrieval in an infective endocarditis acute stroke. Although an interventional approach for treatment of acute stroke related to infective endocarditis is a promising option, it is controversial and a cautious clinical decision should be made on a case-by-case basis.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29175238/,Which Patent Foramen Ovales Need Closure to Prevent Cryptogenic Strokes?,"Patients with cryptogenic strokes are more likely to have a patent foremen ovale than in the general population. It is speculated that these strokes are due to paradoxical embolism, that is, passage of a venous thrombus across the patent foremen ovale to enter the arterial circulation, resulting in an embolic stroke. Venous thromboembolism is rarely present in these cases of cryptogenic stroke. Thousands of patients with cryptogenic strokes have undergone transcatheter closure of their patent foremen ovale via a variety of devices. The first 3 randomized clinical trials comparing patent foremen ovale closure with medical therapy failed to show a significant advantage of patent foremen ovale closure. Three additional trials reported in 2017 had longer years of follow-up and demonstrated an advantage of patent foremen ovale closure versus medical therapy. Analysis of their data indicated that patent foremen ovale closure in patients with an atrial septal aneurysm in addition to a patent foremen ovale had a very significant decrease in cryptogenic strokes (P < .001). There was no decrease in strokes in patients without an aneurysm of the atrial septum who underwent patent foremen ovale closure (P = .37). Aneurysms of the atrial septum are easily recognized by echocardiography and are present in approximately one-third of patients with patent foremen ovales. These data suggest that closure of patent foremen ovales in patients with an atrial septal aneurysm is indicated.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12849212/,Long-term prognosis after lacunar infarction,"Lacunar infarcts, small deep infarcts that result from occlusion of a penetrating artery, account for about a quarter of all ischaemic strokes. These infarcts have commonly been regarded as benign vascular lesions with a favourable long-term prognosis. However, recent studies have shown that this is only the case early in the disease course. A few years after infarct, there is an increased risk of death, mainly from cardiovascular causes. The risk of recurrent stroke after lacunar infarct is similar to that for most other types of stroke, and patients have an increased risk of developing cognitive decline and dementia. Age, vascular risk factors, high nocturnal blood pressure, and severity of cerebral small-vessel disease at onset have significant prognostic implications for almost all outcomes. More studies on mechanisms, prevention, and treatment are needed to provide specific guidance on the long-term management of patients with lacunar infarcts.

The Western overview included seven studies involving a total of 405,511 individuals. During a mean follow-up period of 11 years, 843 strokes were observed. The Eastern overview included 18 cohorts involving a total of 124,774 participants. During a mean follow-up duration of 9 years, 1,798 strokes were observed. The shape of the association between usual DBP and the risk of stroke was similar in Western and Eastern populations, but in Eastern populations the size of the association was about 50% steeper than that in Western populations. This may be due, at least in part, to cerebral haemorrhage comprising a greater proportion of total stroke in Eastern populations.

Although stroke severity and clinical outcomes appear to be poorer in wake-up strokes than nonwake-up strokes, many patients with wake-up strokes do not receive thrombolytic therapy because stroke onset time cannot be determined. Recent studies have suggested, however, that the actual onset time of wake-up stroke is close to the wake-up time. Furthermore, advanced imaging technologies may enable us to identify patients with favorable risk-benefit profiles for thrombolysis. Indeed, empirical thrombolytic treatments have suggested safety and feasibility of such therapy in these patients. Based on these promising results and the development of multimodal imaging methods, prospective thrombolysis trials using predefined imaging criteria are currently under way to test the safety and efficacy of thrombolysis in patients with wake-up or unclear-onset strokes.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25472000/,Factors affecting clinical outcome in large-vessel occlusive ischemic strokes,"Clinical outcome after large-vessel occlusive strokes depends on admitting clinical condition, successful recanalization, and robust collateral circulation. However, predicting successful recanalization and quantifying collateral status in the acute setting remain elusive. Successful recanalization has many predictive factors. Strong evidence supports increasing clot length being associated with poor recanalization. Current imaging techniques completed in the acute setting suggest that clot length can be estimated with a clot burden score. In vitro evidence suggests that clots with more red blood cells and less thrombin lyse more easily after systemic fibrinolysis. Clinical correlations with clot composition have been mixed, although one study suggested that clot composition could be predicted with computed tomography and correlate with successful recanalization. Finally, overwhelming proof shows that robust collateral circulation correlates with improved clinical outcome. Imaging modalities in the acute setting remain promising, with studies suggesting that collaterals can be quantified with computed tomography angiography and perfusion studies. Patients with large-vessel occlusive strokes have variable clinical responses to fibrinolysis and thrombectomy. Independent predictive variables that can possibly alter clinical outcome appear to be successful recanalization and robust collateral circulation. Future studies that allow for better prediction of successful recanalization and quantification of collateral status may help clinical decision-making when evaluating large-vessel occlusions.",clot composition; clot length; collateral; ischemic stroke; outcome; recanalization.,Michelle P Lin;Georgios Tsivgoulis;Andrei V Alexandrov;Jason J Chang

We used delayed perfusion, as represented by time to peak map on perfusion MRI, to classify strokes in 39 patients. Strokes were classified as hemodynamic if delayed perfusion extended to a whole territory of the occluded arterial trunk; as embolic if delayed perfusion was absent or restricted to infarcts; as arteriosclerotic if infarcts were small, multiple, and located mainly in the basal ganglias; or as unclassified if the pathophysiology was unclear. We compared these findings with vascular lesions on cerebral angiography, neurological signs, infarction on MRI, ischemia on xenon-enhanced CT (Xe/CT) and collateral pathway development. Delayed perfusion clearly indicated the area of arterial occlusion. Strokes were classified as hemodynamic in 13 patients, embolic in 14 patients, arteriosclerotic in 6 patients and unclassified in 6 patients. Hemodynamic infarcts were seen only in deep white-matter areas such as the centrum semiovale or corona radiata, whereas embolic infarcts were in the cortex, cortex and subjacent white matter, and lenticulo-striatum. Embolic and arteriosclerotic infarcts occurred even in hemo-dynamically compromised hemispheres. Our findings indicate that perfusion MRI, in association with a detailed analysis of T2-weighted MRI of cerebral infarcts in the axial and coronal planes, can accurately classify stroke as hemodynamic, embolic or arteriosclerotic.",,Y Nakayama;Y Ueno;A Tanaka;Y Nomoto;K Takano

One hundred and seven patients (17%) had second stroke. The stroke morbidity was 0.6 per 1000 people in men and 0.4 in women, being higher for ischemic stroke. Mean fatality rate was 25.7%. The fatality rate for hemorrhagic stroke (up to 75% in 2004) was higher than for ischemic stroke (up to 23.5% in 2006).",,N N Korneeva;N N Spirin
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34252070/,Absent Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery as a Potential Cause of Ischemic Stroke: A Case Report,"BACKGROUND Embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) represents 20-30% of ischemic strokes, with a high risk of recurrence. It usually requires an extensive diagnostic evaluation to address the potential etiologies. Coronary artery anomaly (CAA) of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) is uncommon, and it is known to be linked to myocardial complications. The association of this anomaly with ischemic strokes has not been reported yet. Here, we report on a rare case of a young patient with hypoplastic LAD complicated by an impaired ventricular function that resulted in left ventricular (LV) thrombus formation as a source of recurrent ischemic strokes. CASE REPORT A 36-year-old man had a 4-year history of recurrent strokes despite maintaining antiplatelet treatment. He had no pre-existing vascular risk factors or relevant family history. The initial stroke etiology work-up was inconclusive. A transesophageal echocardiogram showed moderate ventricular hypokinesia. A coronary angiogram was initiated, and a hypoplastic (LAD) artery anomaly was found. At first, the antiplatelet therapy was maintained. Later on, he presented with transient focal neurological symptoms indicative of a transient ischemic attack. Repeated echocardiograms detected left ventricular thrombus. Apixaban was started, with successful thrombus resolution in a one-month follow-up echocardiogram. He has not had a further recurrent ischemic event for 18 months. CONCLUSIONS This case suggests that CAAs might be considered as an associated etiology of ESUS in a young patient with recurrent cerebral events. In a clinical setting, we encourage early use of advanced cerebral and cardiac imaging modalities to accurately determine the stroke etiology, target the appropriate treatment, and prevent a further neurological sequel.",,Alia Ali Alokley;Aishah Albakr;Mohammed Almansori

Such periprocedural strokes are associated with a three-fold increased risk of mortality. Our primary aim was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of electroencephalogram (EEG) in predicting perioperative strokes through meta-analysis of existing literature. An extensive search for relevant literature was undertaken using PubMed and Web of Science databases. Studies were included after screening using predetermined criteria. Data was extracted and analyzed. Summary sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio were obtained. Subgroup analysis of studies using eight or more EEG channels was done. Perioperative stroke rate for the cohort of 8765 patients was 1.75%. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of EEG changes in predicting these strokes were 52% (95% confidence interval [CI], 43-61%) and 84% (95% CI, 81-86%) respectively. Summary estimates of the subgroup were similar. The diagnostic odds ratio was 5.85 (95% CI, 3.71-9.22). For the observed stroke rate, the positive likelihood ratio was 3.25 while the negative predictive value was 98.99%. According to these results, patients with perioperative strokes have six times greater odds of experiencing an intraoperative change in EEG during CEA. EEG monitoring was found to be highly specific in predicting perioperative strokes after CEA.",Carotid endarterectomy; Carotid stenosis; EEG; Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring; Postoperative complications; Stroke.,Parthasarathy D Thirumala;Karthy Thiagarajan;Satyanarayana Gedela;Donald J Crammond;Jeffrey R Balzer

This report presents the analysis of risk factors for ischaemic stroke from a representative cohort of middle aged men from South Wales and south-west England. Data on risk factors were collected through validated questionnaires and physical and clinical measurements. Details of possible cerebrovascular events were retrieved, classified into ischaemic, haemorrhagic and uncertain subtypes, and validated. The ratio of definite ischaemic to definite haemorrhagic strokes was calculated. This showed that the vast majority of strokes of unknown subtype were likely to ischaemic. After exclusion of known haemorrhagic strokes and subarrachnoid haemorrhages the remaining strokes were labelled ischaemic. Hazard ratios for possible risk factors were calculated for all ischaemic, and for fatal and non-fatal strokes. There were 293 ischaemic strokes. Statistically significant age-adjusted hazard ratios were: 1.50 (95% confidence interval 1.16-1.95) for being in a manual social class, 1.82 (1.24-2.67) if smoking >15 cigarettes/d at enrollment, 1.19 (1.13-1.24) and 1.23 (1.14-1.34) per 10 mmHg increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, 0.67 (0.46-0.96) for the top quintile high density lipoprotein-cholesterol:cholesterol ratio compared to the bottom quintile, 2.04 (1.40-2.99) for presence of angina, 3.90 (2.01-7.58) for presence of atrial fibrillation, and 3.35 (1.90-5.80) for presence of diabetes.

A total number of 1453 patients were started on hemodialysis The total follow-up period was 4982.22 patients/year, with 84 patients having stroke. The cumulative incidence of stroke in our patients was 5.8%, with an incidence rate of 1686 strokes per 100 000 patient-years. The incidence rate in the first year was 1803 strokes per 100 000 patients-year, 6.5% higher than its average over the period studied. In the remaining period, the rates ranged between 356 and 1626 strokes per 100 000 patients-year. Significative factors related to stroke were: diabetes, myocardial infarction or angina, hypertension, arteriosclerosis/intermittent claudication, history of stroke before the HD and atrial fibrillation.

Stroke severity at baseline, as assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), was similar in the two groups.

Population-based longitudinal studies which include collection of risk factor data are required for a better understanding of stroke aetiology. From a representative cohort of men from South Wales and South-west England, followed up for a median of 17 y, details of possible cerebrovascular events were collected from questionnaires, hospital admission data, general practitioner records, death certificates, radiology records and post-mortem reports. Radiology records, and strokes and transient ischaemic attacks were independently validated. There were 433 strokes and 163 transient ischaemic attacks identified during follow-up. Of these, 333 were the first ever in a lifetime strokes of which 139 were definite ischaemic, 20 were haemorrhagic and 168 were probable ischaemic strokes. The crude incidence rate for stroke was 445 (95% confidence interval 398-493) per 100 000 person years. The age-standardised rates for 10 y age-bands were: 45-54 y 91 (10-172); 55-64 y 351 (269-432) and 65-74 y 855 (669-1040). The 30 d case-fatality rate was 21.0% (70/333) for all strokes and 19.2% (60/312) for ischaemic strokes. For transient ischaemic attacks the age-standardised incidence rates for the same 10 y age bands were 92 (4-179), 111 (64-157), and 273 (167-80), respectively. These rates for stroke transient ischaemic attack are likely to be accurate given the high ascertainment of events in this representative population of middle-aged men.

The anterior pattern consists mainly of perseverations and superimposition of unrelated information, apathy, and amnesia. After paramedian infarct, the most frequent features are disinhibition syndromes, with personality changes, loss of self-activation, amnesia, and, in the case of extensive lesions, thalamic ""dementia""; this pattern may often be difficult to distinguish from primary psychiatric disorders, especially when neurologic dysfunction is lacking. After inferolateral lesion, executive dysfunction may develop but is often overlooked, although it may occasionally lead to severe long-term disability. After posterior lesion, whereas cognitive dysfunction with neglect and aphasia are well known, no specific behavioral syndrome has been reported.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20795935/,Vitamin D supplementation: a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of strokes,"Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent due to lifestyle and environmental factors which limit sunlight induced vitamin D production in the skin. This ""pandemic"" of vitamin D deficiency is of concern because low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) have been associated with cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, infectious, autoimmune and malignant diseases. Epidemiological studies have largely but not consistently shown that vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for strokes. This is supported by associations of low 25(OH)D levels with cerebrovascular risk factors, in particular with arterial hypertension. Vitamin D has also been shown to exert neuroprotective, neuromuscular and osteoprotective effects which may reduce cognitive and functional impairments in poststroke patients. Hence, the current literature favours the notion that vitamin D supplementation is a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of strokes but accurate data from interventional studies are missing. Randomized controlled trials are therefore urgently needed to evaluate whether vitamin D supplementation reduces the incidence of strokes and improves the outcome of poststroke patients. We do, however, believe that currently published data on the multiple health benefits of vitamin D and the easy safe and inexpensive way by which it can be supplemented already argue for the prevention and treatment of vitamin D deficiency in order to reduce stroke associated morbidity and mortality.",,Stefan Pilz;Andreas Tomaschitz;Christiane Drechsler;Armin Zittermann;Jacqueline M Dekker;Winfried März

Major advances in stroke prevention through treatment of known risk factors has led to stroke being considered largely preventable. For example, in the United States, stroke mortality rates have declined 70% over the past 50 years, in large part because of important reductions in hypertension, tobacco smoking, and more recently, increased use of anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (2,3). Although the reduction in stroke mortality is recognized as one of the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century (4), gains can still be made.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11922227/,"Squatting, blood pressure and stroke","Most Indians still adopt squatting posture in toilets. In a group of 67 healthy volunteers, squatting produced a small (8.09 +/- 7.04 mm Hg) but significant rise in systolic blood pressure (SBP) but not in diastolic (DBP). However, in a group of randomly selected treated hypertensives (N=104) squatting produced a much greater and significant rise in both SBP (14.46 +/- 11.63 mm Hg) and DBP (9.10 +/- 9.19 mm Hg). The possible clinical significance of this rise of BP in squatting has been evaluated in 100 consecutive CT proved patients with stroke by analysing their stroke onset data in relation to time, place, posture and activity. Most strokes (52%) occurred in the morning hours (5 am-9 am) and at home (86%) and over a third (36%) while in toilets. Thirty six percent of strokes occurred when the subjects squatted, mostly during defecation. More than half of hemorrhagic strokes occurred in the squatting position. The relationship of these clinical observations with the BP changes noted above on squatting appears to be more than fortuitous.

They can also provide valuable data on outcome. In the present article, data from 1631 Swiss patients randomised in the International Stroke Trial (IST) are presented. Baseline characteristics and outcome in the Swiss patients were compared with the 17,804 patients randomised in other countries. On average, compared with other countries, Swiss patients were: 2.5 years older (CI: 1.9-3.1; p < 0.001); more likely to have presented with total anterior circulation infarcts (28 vs 23%); less likely to have lacunar strokes (16 vs 25%; p < 0.00001); more likely to be randomised and treated early (within 3 hours, 7 vs 4%, and within 6 hours, 25 vs 15%; p < 0.00001). However, Swiss patients were more likely to be dead or dependent 6 months after the stroke (66.9 vs 62.2%; p < 0.00001). The difference in death or dependency was almost entirely explained by the difference in age and baseline severity of strokes. These data highlight the difficulties inherent in between-country comparisons of outcome after stroke. They also emphasise the need for international multicentre trials to use methods of randomisation (either stratification or minimisation), as IST did, to ensure balance of prognostic factors within each participating country; to do otherwise might confound the assessment of the effect of treatment.",,H P Mattle;E Eicher Vella;C Bassetti;P Sandercock

Stroke after myocardial infarction (MI) and acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) is not infrequent, occurring in 0.7%-2.5% of patients within 6 months of the coronary event. The etiology of these events can be frequently traced to the development of left ventricular thrombus (LVT) formation after large MI episodes. Often, however, these events are directly related to catheter-based procedures or anticoagulation strategies utilized to treat the ACS. Ischemic strokes outnumber hemorrhagic strokes in this population.

Out of 142 patients admitted to our neurology department during this period, 74 patients had had strokes. Their mean age was 55.9 years and their sex ratio 1.53. Ischemic strokes accounted for 57% of the total, followed by cerebral hemorrhage (39%). Forty-six patients (62%) were AA genotype, 27 (36%) patients had sickle cell trait (16 AC and 11 AS) and three patients were homozygous CC. This study showed a higher prevalence of hemoglobinopathies in patients with stroke than in the general population.

An association between microRNA-146a (miR-146a) and miR-149 polymorphisms and strokes was inconclusive. This meta-analysis aimed to reevaluate the strength of the association by searching online databases and retrieving relevant case-control studies published between 2000 and 2016. Nine articles including 8 on miR-146a rs2910164 G/C and 3 on miR-149 rs2292832 C/T in 3372 patients with stroke and 4394 controls were included. The miR-149 rs2292832 was significantly associated with the risk of a stroke under allelic (C vs T: odds ratio [OR] = 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01-1.29; P = .03), homologous (CC vs TT: OR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.05-1.77; P = .02), and recessive models (CC vs CT + TT: OR = 1.34; 95% CI = 1.05-1.71; P = .02). No correlation was detected between miR-146a rs2910164 and susceptibility to a stroke. In conclusion, the results suggested that miR-149 might be a risk factor for the development of a stroke, while miR-146a might not be.

There are more frequent carotid stenoses and impaired tiny arteries in diabetics compared to non-diabetic population. Recently, it has been pointed at an importance of early detection of hyperglycaemia in ischemic brain accidents, because hyperglycaemia seriously affects ischemic brain tissue. Apart from other things, it leads to impairment of motor functions. A specialist providing care to diabetics must consider and start treatment of all the risk factors.

While the ""buckle"" of this Stroke Belt coincides with the Southeastern Coastal Plain region of North and South Carolina and Georgia, there is a paucity of information pinpointing specific causes for this phenomenon. A number of studies posit that an exposure event-potentially microbial in nature-early in life, could be a risk factor. The most likely vector for such an exposure event would be the soils of the Southeastern Coastal Plain region. These soils may have chemical and physical properties which are conducive to the growth and survival of microorganisms which may predispose individuals to stroke. To this aim, we correlated SC stroke mortality data to soil characteristics found in the NRCS SSURGO database. In statewide comparisons, depth to water table (50 to 100 cm, R = 0.62) and soil drainage class (poorly drained, R = 0.59; well drained, R = -0.54) both showed statistically significant relationships with stroke rate. In a 20 county comparison, depth to water table, drainage class, hydric rating (hydric soils, R = 0.56), and pH (very strongly acid, R = 0.66) all showed statistically significant relationships with stroke rate.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22609330/,Concurrent silent strokes impair motor function by limiting behavioral compensation,"Silent strokes occur more frequently than classic strokes; however, symptoms may go unreported in spite of lasting tissue damage. A silent stroke may indicate elevated susceptibility to recurrent stroke, which may eventually result in apparent and lasting impairments. Here we investigated if multiple silent strokes to the motor system challenge the compensatory capacity of the brain to cumulatively result in permanent functional deficits. Adult male rats with focal ischemia received single focal ischemic mini-lesions in the sensorimotor cortex (SMC) or the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), or multiple lesions affecting both SMC and DLS. The time course and outcome of motor compensation and recovery were determined by quantitative and qualitative assessment of skilled reaching and skilled walking. Rats with SMC or DLS lesion alone did not show behavioral deficits in either task. However, the combination of focal ischemic lesions in SMC and DLS perturbed skilled reaching accuracy and disrupted forelimb placement in the ladder rung walking task. These observations suggest that multiple focal infarcts, each resembling a silent stroke, gradually compromise the plastic capacity of the motor system to cause permanent motor deficits. Moreover, these findings support the notion that cortical and subcortical motor systems cooperate when adopting beneficial compensatory movement strategies.",,Jamshid Faraji;Kristyn Kurio;Gerlinde A Metz

Current management strategies are based primarily on single arm clinical trials and observational studies, coupled with principles of neurology and hematology. Initial management of a focal neurologic deficit includes evaluation by a multidisciplinary team (a hematologist, neurologist, neuroradiologist, and transfusion medicine specialist); prompt neuro-imaging and an initial blood transfusion (simple followed immediately by an exchange transfusion or only exchange transfusion) is recommended if the hemoglobin is >4 gm/dL and <10 gm/dL. Standard therapy for secondary prevention of strokes and silent cerebral infarcts includes regular blood transfusion therapy and in selected cases, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

An autopsy study of 100 consecutive acute ischaemic strokes,"Estimates of the frequency of different types of ischaemic stroke vary widely, particularly those said to be of embolic aetiology. This retrospective autopsy study of 100 acute ischaemic strokes was undertaken to clarify the incidence of cardio-embolic stroke. Criteria for separating cardio-embolic from other forms of stroke were defined. Using these criteria, 26% of acute ischaemic strokes were cardio-embolic, 28% thrombotic, 12% atheromatous and the remainder due to various other causes including hypoperfusion with 11% being of undetermined aetiology. A significantly higher incidence of non-hypertensive cardiac disease was found in the group in whom no thrombus or thrombo-embolus was found at autopsy, suggesting that some of these strokes may have been due to unrecognised cerebral hypoperfusion. Haemodynamic stroke is probably an important and underrecognised form of acute ischaemic stroke.",,J M MacKenzie

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12766368/,The role of blood pressure in lacunar strokes preceded by TIAs,"Lacunar strokes (LS) are often preceded by repetitive transitory ischaemic attacks (TIAs) known as 'capsular warning syndrome'. The treatment of these symptoms remains controversial. Anticoagulants are often used in this situation, most of the time, however, with no or little benefit. Since it is not rare that these TIAs lead to a definite stroke, the therapeutic approach in the acute phase is very important. We report six patients presenting LS preceded by TIAs. All patients showed intermittent decrease of blood pressure (BP) coinciding with clinical worsening and leading to definite stroke in four of them. All were treated with full-dose intravenous heparin, which did not prevent further clinical deterioration. One patient received noradrenalin, which allowed stabilisation of the blood pressure values and complete resolution of the neurological symptoms. This observation suggests that in lacunar strokes preceded by TIAs monitoring and, if necessary, pharmacological increase of BP may prevent some patients from developing a definite stroke. Thus the 'capsular warning syndrome' could reflect a haemodynamic failure rather than repeated thrombo-embolism within the lumen of a single perforating arteriole.",,P H Lalive;I Mayor;R Sztajzel

As a result, there is no shortage of reports in the vascular surgery literature describing simultaneous coronary and carotid artery revascularizations. Generally, these reports have found this combination of operations safe, but have stopped short of proving that it is necessary. Intuitively, simultaneous carotid endarterectomy and coronary artery bypass surgery could be justified if most perioperative strokes were the result of a significant carotid stenosis, either directly or indirectly. At first glance this appears to be a fairly straightforward issue; however, much of the evidence on both sides of the argument is circumstantial. One significant problem in analyzing outcome by choice of treatment in patients presenting with both coronary and carotid disease is the multiple potential causes of stroke in coronary bypass patients, which include hemorrhage and atheroemboli from aortic atheromas during clamping. But this controversial subject is now open to discussion, and our debaters have been given the challenge to clarify the evidence to justify their claims.",,Yuebing Li;John Castaldo;Jan Van der Heyden;Herbert W M Plokker

However, investigators point out that too often such patients receive expensive CT scans to rule out strokes even though CT not a good tool for this purpose. Experts say a bedside assessment that focuses on eye movements can do a better job of distinguishing between patients who are having strokes and those who have a benign form of dizziness, but the assessment requires clinical skill to perform with confidence. Nonetheless, some experts believe that the assessment will become a standard of care in the diagnosis of patients who present with dizziness within five years. Investigators project that costs associated with ED visits for dizziness will reach $4.4 billion by 2015, with much of this cost coming from expensive imaging tests that provide little value. Data show that the use of imaging tests on patients who present with dizziness has quadrupled since 1995.

MAST-Italy Collaborative Group,"Thrombolysis increases case fatality but reduces the proportion of disabled survivors in recent trials in acute ischaemic stroke, although some trials show much higher mortality rates than others. One possible explanation for the different outcomes between trials is that the treatment effect with thrombolysis varies with baseline prognostic factors such as stroke severity. We examined the interaction between baseline risk and thrombolysis on outcome using individual patient data from the Multicentre Acute Stroke Trial-Italy (MAST-I). A multiple logistic regression of the MAST-I data was performed to identify which factors, identifiable at randomisation, most strongly predict a poor functional outcome. We then stratified the patients into those with severe strokes and those with mild strokes and examined the effect of thrombolysis on (a) case fatality and (b) dependency at 6 months after the stroke in the 157 patients who received streptokinase alone and the 156 controls. Streptokinase was found to cause an absolute increase of about 3% in case fatality in both ""severe"" and ""mild"" strokes; however, there was a 12% reduction in the number of dead or dependent ""mild"" strokes but a 6% increase in ""severe"" strokes. The number of patients was small, and therefore neither finding was statistically significant. In this exploratory analysis, the hazard with streptokinase appears similar in ""severe"" and ""mild"" strokes, but the benefit may be greater in ""mild"" strokes.

The objective of our study was to evaluate, through a questionnaire, the opinion of prescribing doctors working in the Department of Neurology of The FANN National Teaching Hospital in Dakar.

This was an opinion poll about their concerns about the nutritional status of patients in the therapeutic projects they propose during the stroke. The type of the chosen opinion poll was elementary, type random. The questionnaire was individual and consisted of five items of single-response and multiple-choice questions. The results of this study reveal that while the nutritional status of patients with limited autonomy in the service was a concern in the intentions of the prescribers, in practice it was not taken into account in therapeutic projects.

Among all strokes, 67.5±0.6% was ischemic stroke, 18.3±0.5% was hemorrhagic stroke and 5.3±0.3% subarachnoid hemorrhage. It was not possible to specify the type of stroke in 9.0±0.4% of cases. A trend towards lower incidence of a stroke in the region in 1999-2008 was noted. Survival after the stroke has averaged 2.08 years and didn't change significantly in 1999-2008. On average, 1/3 patients with stroke die within a year. The indicator of annual mortality in 1999-2008 showed no statistically significant changes, with interval 31.5±1.7-37.2±2.2%.",,R R Aliev;R K Shiralieva

The complex role played by aldosterone in the pathogenesis of stroke is beginning to emerge. Chronic mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blockade reduces the incidence of hemorrhagic strokes and the severity of damage caused by ischemic strokes. This appears to be a vascular phenomenon because MR blockade increases vessel lumen diameter, which presumably increases blood flow and perfusion of the tissue to reduce ischemic damage. However, the vascular protection afforded by MR antagonism is at odds with the results seen within the brain, where MR activation is required for neuronal survival. Both of these divergent effects have possible therapeutic implications for stroke.",,Christiné S Rigsby;William E Cannady;Anne M Dorrance

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22389052/,Antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and mechanical heart valves,"Cardioembolic strokes account for one-sixth of all strokes and are an important potentially preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. Vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin) are effective for the prevention of cardioembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and in those with mechanical heart valves but because of their inherent limitations are underutilized and often suboptimally managed. Antiplatelet therapies have been the only alternatives to warfarin for stroke prevention in AF but although they are safer and more convenient they are much less efficacious. The advent of new oral anticoagulant drugs offers the potential to reduce the burden of cardioembolic stroke by providing access to effective, safe, and more convenient therapies. New oral anticoagulants have begun to replace warfarin for stroke prevention in some patients with AF, based on the favorable results of recently completed phase III randomized controlled trials, and provide for the first time an alternative to antiplatelet therapy for patients deemed unsuitable for warfarin. The promise of the new oral anticoagulants in patients with mechanical heart valves is currently being tested in a phase II trial. If efficacy and safety are demonstrated, the new oral anticoagulants will provide an alternative to warfarin for patients with mechanical heart valves and may also lead to increased use of mechanical valves for patients who would not have received them in the past because of the requirement for long term warfarin therapy.",,John W Eikelboom;Robert G Hart

Features that have been reported to support cardioembolism as a mechanism for ischemic stroke have included documented cardiac source of embolism, maximal neurologic deficit at onset, multiple cerebrovascular territories involved, enhanced tendency toward hemorrhagic transformation, enhanced risk of syncope or seizure associated with presentation, and lower likelihood of premonitory transient ischemic attacks. Features that tend to make cardioembolic stroke less likely include significant cerebral atherosclerosis, step-wise progression of the neurologic deficit within a finite period of time, vascular distribution such as entire internal carotid artery territory with combined middle cerebral artery and anterior cerebral artery involvement or watershed distribution, and premonitory transient ischemic attacks. A number of cardiac conditions can promote thromboembolism, and there is risk stratification reflective of the specific condition or coexistent conditions.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17998439/,Big strokes in small persons,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is understood on a genetic and a molecular level better than most diseases. Young children with SCD are at a very high risk of stroke. The molecular pathologic abnormalities of SCD lead to microvascular occlusion and intravascular hemolytic anemia. Microvascular occlusion is related to painful episodes and probably causes microcirculatory problems in the brain. The most commonly recognized stroke syndrome in children with SCD is large-artery infarction. These ""big strokes"" are the result of a vascular process involving the large arteries of the circle of Willis leading to territorial infarctions from perfusion failure or possibly artery-to-artery embolism. We can detect children who are developing cerebral vasculopathy using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) and can provide effective intervention. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography measures blood flow velocity in the large arteries of the circle of Willis. Velocity is generally increased by the severe anemia in these patients, and it becomes elevated in a focal manner when stenosis reduces the arterial diameter. Children with SCD who are developing high stroke risk can be detected months to years before the stroke using TCD. Healthy adults have a middle cerebral artery velocity of approximately 60 cm/s, whereas children without anemia have velocities of approximately 90 cm/s. In SCD, the mean is approximately 130 cm/s. Two independent studies have demonstrated that the risk of stroke in children with SCD increases with TCD velocity. The Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) (1995-2000) was halted prematurely when it became evident that regular blood transfusions produced a marked (90%) reduction in first stroke. Children were selected for STOP if they had 2 TCD studies with velocities of 200 cm/s or greater. Children not undergoing transfusion had a stroke risk of 10% per year, which was reduced to less than 1% per year by regular blood transfusions. Stroke risk in all children with SCD is approximately 0.5% to 1.0% per year. On the basis of STOP, if the patient meets the high-risk TCD criteria, regular blood transfusions are recommended. A second study was performed (2000-2005) to attempt withdrawal of transfusion in selected children in a randomized controlled study. Children with initially abnormal TCD velocities (> or =200 cm/s) treated with regular blood transfusion for 30 months or more, which resulted in reduction of the TCD to less than 170 cm/s, were eligible for randomization into STOP II. Half continued transfusion and half had cessation of transfusion. This trial was halted early for safety reasons. There was an unacceptably high rate of TCD reversion back to high risk (> or =200 cm/s), as well as 2 strokes in children who discontinued transfusion. There are no evidence-based guidelines for the discontinuation of transfusion in children once they have been identified as having high risk based on TCD. The current situation is undesirable because of the long-term effects of transfusion, including iron overload. Iron overload has recently become easier to manage with the introduction of an oral iron chelator. The inflammatory environment known to exist in SCD and the known effect of plasma free hemoglobin, released by hemolysis, of reducing available nitric oxide may contribute to the development of cerebrovascular disease. Further research may lead to more targeted therapies. We can reduce many of the big strokes that occur in these small persons by aggressively screening patients at a young age (and periodically throughout the childhood risk period) and interrupting the process with regular blood transfusions.",,Robert J Adams

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21109500/,Neuroimaging in assessment of risk of stroke in children with sickle cell disease,"Stroke and subclinical ""silent infarcts"" are major causes of morbidity in children with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Ischemic strokes are more common in younger children while hemorrhagic strokes are more frequent in adults. The goal of neuroimaging in acute stroke is to document whether the stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic, to assess the extent of parenchymal abnormalities and to determine the presence of other cerebrovascular lesions. Computed Tomography (CT) is the primary modality for the assessment of acute stroke patients because of its 24/7 availability and ability to exclude hemorrhagic causes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR angiography (MRA) are recommended to determine precisely extent of infarction and detect cerebrovascular abnormalities. The goal of neuroimaging in patients with hemorrhagic stroke is to identify an arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm(s) amenable to surgery or catheter intervention.The risk of first stroke is very high in asymptomatic children with intracranial arterial mean velocities over 200 cm/s on transcranial Doppler (TCD) examination. The risk can be substantially reduced if chronic blood transfusions are timely implemented. Large cerebral vessel disease detected by TCD can be confirmed or excluded by MRI/MRA. Those with evidence of parenchymal and/or cerebrovascular lesions should be followed by preventive therapy. In patients with neurologic symptoms and negative MRI/MRA findings Positron Emission Tomography or single photon emission CT is recommended. There are no specific neuroimaging findings that suggest that blood transfusions can be safely halted in children with SCD.",,M Arkuszewski;E R Melhem;J Krejza

Although different opinions exist about the definition, diagnosis, and measurement of outcomes related to depression after stroke, there is little debate about the prevalence of depression symptoms and their impact on stroke survivors and their families. Depression after stroke has long been recognized as a common condition with many negative effects in the poststroke period, but more recently depression has also been identified as an independent stroke risk factor. Given that there are at least 500,000 new ischemic strokes yearly in the United States, a conservative estimate is that 150,000 U.S. stroke survivors develop poststroke depression each year. Because effective treatments exist but are likely underutilized for depression, this is an important example of an evidence-practice gap to which increased efforts to improve care should be made. Such efforts would likely improve not only patient symptoms but may also decrease stroke risk, influence stroke functional recovery, decrease mortality, and reduce poststroke health care utilization. This article provides an overview of depression diagnosis in stroke, reviews the epidemiology of poststroke depression and its associated morbidity and mortality, and reviews existing evidence on the treatment and prevention of poststroke depression.",,Linda S Williams

Common predisposing factors include age, a previous stroke, atrial fibrillation, and vascular and metabolic diseases. The mortality is more than two times greater than in strokes occurring outside the hospital. Delayed diagnosis and a synergistic interaction between the inflammatory changes normally associated with stroke, and those normally occurring after surgery, may explain this increase. Intraoperative hypotension is an infrequent direct cause of stroke.

Under the national insurance for care and assistance for the elderly starting in 2000, data must be obtained on the prognostic status of stroke patients in communities. We identified 322 incident strokes in six communities (total census population=71,610) during the two- or three-years survey period between 1987 and 1990, and we completed a follow-up of the respective prognoses of most of these patients at one, three, and five years after the onset (n=315 stroke patients) (98%). One year after stroke, 33% of the 315 strokes were dead, 13% were dependent, and 54% were independent. After three years, 44% were dead, 13% were dependent, and 43% were independent. After five years, 52% were dead, 9% were dependent, and 39% were independent. The long-term prognosis was poorer with increased age, and poorer for women than for men except in the case of men ages less than 55 years old at onset. Among patients who were dependents, the proportion of taken care at home was approximately 30% one year after onset, and 50% three to five years after onset. It is estimated that approximately 17 dependents from 127 incident strokes in a population of around 70,000 every year. Because the average survival time of dependents was about 4 years, the prevalence of dependents is estimated to be 68, indicating that the prevalence is about 10 persons per 10,000. Over the period of this study, and as compared with the reported proportions in community-based studies in the 1970's, the proportion of deaths declined and that of independents increased, probably due to reduced severity of stroke. However, the proportion of dependents did not change significantly over time. Thus, under the terms of the new national insurance, it is essential for family and communities to cooperate in taking care of dependent stroke patients.",,T Ikebe;H Ozawa;M Lida;T Shimamoto;K Handa;Y Komachi

Angiotensin II antagonists (irbesartan and losartan) are able to reduce the rate of progression of diabetic nephropathy in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes. This preventive effect occurs independently of the stage of renal dysfunction (early stage in IRMA, patent nephropathy in RENAAL and advanced nephropathy in IDNT).

Stroke remains a massive public health problem and there is an increasing need for better strategies for the prevention and treatment of this disease. At least 20% of ischemic strokes are thromboembolic in nature, caused by a thromboembolism from an atherosclerotic plaque at the carotid bifurcation or the internal carotid artery. Current clinical guidelines for both primary and secondary prevention of stroke in patients with carotid stenosis caused by atherosclerotic plaques remain reliant on general patient characteristics (traditional risk factors for stroke) and static measures of the degree of artery stenosis. Patients with similar traditional risk factors, however, have been found to have different risk of stroke, and it has in recent years become increasingly clear that the degree of artery stenosis alone is not the best estimation of stroke risk. There is a need for new methods for the assessment of stroke risk to improve risk prediction for the individual patient. This review aims to give an overview of new methods available for the identification of carotid plaque instability and the assessment of stroke risk.",,Karolina Skagen;Mona Skjelland;Mahtab Zamani;David Russell

We present a case of a patient who presented with recurrent posterior circulation infarcts despite optimized medical management. On imaging, he was found to have external anatomical vertebral artery muscular and/or osseous compression leading to repetitive vascular injury and strokes. Recurrent intimal injury and vertebral artery to intracranial emboli despite anticoagulation and subsequent dual antiplatelet therapy necessitated definitive operative management. Surgical bypass, external surgical decompression, reconstructive endovascular, and deconstructive endovascular techniques were carefully considered. A deconstructive endovascular approach was chosen as the least morbid option. The use of endovascular plugs such as a microvascular plug provides a quick and effective means of achieving a therapeutic parent artery occlusion in lieu of traditional coil occlusion. Although reserved as a last resort, parent artery occlusion can be a viable option to treat recurrent strokes, particularly in a nondominant vertebral artery.",Bow Hunter’s syndrome; Recurrent posterior circulation strokes; endovascular deconstruction; extravasal compression; microvascular plug (MVP); vertebral artery dissection.,Aldo Fabrizio Berti;Atif Zafar;Asad Ikram;Christopher S Calder;Danielle Eckart Sorte

In this paper, we review the epidemiology of stroke in Pakistan. Most of the available data are based on hospital-centred case series addressing established stroke risk factors, stroke-related mortality and disability, functional status, and case fatality rates. There are limited population-based data regarding the prevalence of established stroke risk factors in the general population, and no epidemiologic studies have been conducted to specifically identify potential stroke risk factors unique to the region. The limited data that are available from Pakistan indicate that stroke epidemiology differs between Pakistan and Western populations - in Pakistan first stroke occurs at a younger age, particularly among women, and there is a higher proportion of haemorrhagic strokes. Besides the established stroke risk factors (e.g. hypertension, smoking, and diabetes) some potentially unique stroke risk factors related to life style and dietary habits such as huqqa smoking, use of dalda and desi ghee, and orally consumed forms of tobacco, may exist in Pakistan, and warrant further investigation. The shortage of trained stroke epidemiologists is a major limiting factor to the conduct of epidemiological stroke studies in Pakistan. Epidemiologic data are essential to guide health policy development aimed at decreasing the mortality and morbidity from stroke in Pakistan.

Three types of hemispheric BZIs are described according to topography (ie, superficial anterior, posterior, and deep). Although published series on related aphasia are rare in the setting of BZI, aphasia is of transcortical (TCA) type, characterized by the preservation of repetition. TCA can be of motor, sensory, or mixed type depending on whether expression, understanding, or both are impaired. Recent studies have reported specific aphasic patterns. BZI patients initially presented with mixed TCA. Aphasia specifically evolved according to the stroke location, toward motor or sensory TCA in patients with respectively anterior or posterior BZI. TCA was associated with good long-term prognosis. This specific aphasic pattern is interesting in clinical practice because it prompts the suspicion of a BZI before the MRI is done, and it helps in the planning of rehabilitation and in providing adapted information to the patient and family concerning the likelihood of language recovery.",,Cécile Cauquil-Michon;Constance Flamand-Roze;Christian Denier

This study describes a retrospective review of 65 patients who underwent routine neuropsychological testing and MRI during treatment at a comprehensive sickle cell center. It was hypothesized that (1) children with no evidence of CVA would perform lower than expected on cognitive tasks compared to population-based normative data, (2) children with strokes and children with silent infarcts would perform lower on cognitive tasks and motor skills as compared to patients with no evidence of CVA, and (3) children with evidence of silent infarcts would perform better than children with known overt strokes. This final hypothesis has not been studied previously, as children with known overt stroke and silent infarct were grouped together. Sixty-five children with SCD who were sent for routine neuropsychological testing and brain MRI were identified via retrospective chart review. Patients had been administered neuropsychological tests to assess cognitive, executive and motor function. Brain MRI was obtained from each patient and was analyzed for evidence of cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Based on MRI analysis, 27% of patients with SCD had experienced a stroke and 13% a silent infarct. The majority (59%) of patients diagnosed with stroke or infarct sustained cortical damage to the frontal lobe. Patients with SCD and no evidence of CVA functioned normally on tests of cognitive ability and achievement, but patients with CVA displayed impairments in cognitive function and comparatively lower scores on verbal and performance scales.

We investigated factors contributing to the sex differences. Methods- Individual participant data on 4288 first-ever strokes (1996-2013) were obtained from 4 high-quality population-based incidence studies from Australasia and Europe. HRQoL utility scores among survivors after stroke (range from negative scores=worse than death to 1=perfect health) were calculated from 3 scales including European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions, Short-Form 6-Dimension, and Assessment of Quality of Life at 1 year (3 studies; n=1210) and 5 years (3 studies; n=1057). Quantile regression was used to estimate the median differences in HRQoL for women compared to men with adjustment for covariates. Study factors included sociodemographics, prestroke dependency, stroke-related factors (eg, stroke severity), comorbidities, and poststroke depression. Study-specific median differences were combined into pooled estimates using random-effect meta-analysis. Results- Women had lower pooled HRQoL than men (median differenceunadjusted 1 year, -0.147; 95% CI, -0.258 to -0.036; 5 years, -0.090; 95% CI, -0.119 to -0.062). After adjustment for age, stroke severity, prestroke dependency, and depression, these pooled median differences were attenuated, more greatly at 1 year (-0.067; 95% CI, -0.111 to -0.022) than at 5 years (-0.085; 95% CI, -0.135 to -0.034). Conclusions- Women consistently exhibited poorer HRQoL after stroke than men. This was partly attributable to women's advanced age, more severe strokes, prestroke dependency, and poststroke depression, suggesting targets to reduce the differences. There was some evidence of residual differences in HRQoL between sexes but they were small and unlikely to be clinically significant.",comorbidity; depression; incidence; quality of life; survivors.,Hoang T Phan;Christopher L Blizzard;Mathew J Reeves;Amanda G Thrift;Dominique A Cadilhac;Jonathan Sturm;Emma Heeley;Petr Otahal;Peter Rothwell;Craig S Anderson;Priya Parmar;Rita Krishnamurthi;Suzanne Barker-Collo;Valery Feigin;Seana Gall

Bedside ocular motor testing performed by experts is superior to early MRI in excluding strokes. We sought to demonstrate that differentiation of strokes from VN in our stroke unit is reliable. During a prospective study at a tertiary hospital over 1 year, patients with AVS were evaluated in the emergency department (ED) and underwent admission with targeted examination: gait, gaze-holding, horizontal head impulse test (hHIT), testing for skew deviation (SD) and vertical smooth pursuit (vSP). Neuroimaging included CT, transcranial Doppler (TCD) and MRI with MR angiogram (MRA). VN was diagnosed with normal diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and absence of neurological deficits on follow-up. Acute strokes were confirmed with DWI. A total of 24 patients with AVS were enrolled and divided in two groups. In the pure vestibular group (n = 20), all VN (n = 10/10) had positive hHIT and unidirectional nystagmus, but 1 patient had SD and abnormal vertical smooth pursuit (SP). In all the strokes (n = 10/10), one of the following signs suggestive of central lesion was present: negative hHIT, central-type nystagmus, SD or abnormal vSP. Finding one of these was 100% sensitive and 90% specific for stroke. In the cochleovestibular group (n = 4) all had normal DWI, but 3 patients had central ocular motor signs (abnormal vertical SP and SD). Whilst the study is small, classification of AVS in our stroke unit is reliable. The sensitivity and specificity of bedside ocular motor testing are comparable to those previously reported by expert neuro-otologists. Acute cochleovestibular loss and normal DWI may signify a labyrinthine infarct but differentiating between different causes of inner ear dysfunction is not possible with bedside testing.",,L Chen;W Lee;B R Chambers;H M Dewey

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26909326/,The association of insular stroke with lesion volume,"The insula has been implicated in many sequelae of stroke. It is the area most commonly infarcted in people with post-stroke arrhythmias, loss of thermal sensation, hospital acquired pneumonia, and apraxia of speech. We hypothesized that some of these results reflect the fact that: (1) ischemic strokes that involve the insula are larger than strokes that exclude the insula (and therefore are associated with more common and persistent deficits); and (2) insular involvement is a marker of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. We analyzed MRI scans of 861 patients with acute ischemic hemispheric strokes unselected for functional deficits, and compared infarcts involving the insula to infarcts not involving the insula using t-tests for continuous variables and chi square tests for dichotomous variables. Mean infarct volume was larger for infarcts including the insula (n = 232) versus excluding the insula (n = 629): 65.8 ± 78.8 versus 10.2 ± 15.9 cm(3) (p < 0.00001). Even when we removed lacunar infarcts, mean volume of non-lacunar infarcts that included insula (n = 775) were larger than non-lacunar infarcts (n = 227) that excluded insula: 67.0 cm(3) ± 79.2 versus 11.5 cm(3) ± 16.7 (p < 0.00001). Of infarcts in the 90th percentile for volume, 87% included the insula (χ(2) = 181.8; p < 0.00001). Furthermore, 79.0% infarcts due to MCA occlusion included the insula; 78.5% of infarcts without MCA occlusion excluded the insula (χ(2) = 93.1; p < 0.0001). The association between insular damage and acute or chronic sequelae likely often reflects the fact that insular infarct is a marker of large infarcts caused by occlusion of the MCA more than a specific role of the insula in a range of functions.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30827087/,Technical improvements in carotid revascularization based on the mechanism of procedural stroke,"The benefit of carotid revascularization in patients with severe carotid artery stenosis is hampered by the risk of stroke due to the intervention itself. The risk of periprocedural strokes is higher for carotid artery stenting (CAS) as compared to carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Over the past years, the pathophysiological mechanism responsible for periprocedural stroke seems to unfold step by step. Initially, all procedural strokes were thought to be the result of technical errors during surgical repair: cerebral ischemia due to clamping time of the carotid artery, cerebral embolization of atherosclerotic debris due to manipulation of the atheroma or thrombosis of the artery. Following improvements in surgical techniques, technical skills, new intraoperative monitoring technologies such as angioscopy, and the results of the first large clinical randomized controlled trials (RCT) it was believed that most periprocedural strokes were of thromboembolic nature, while a large part of these caused by technical error. Nowadays, analyses of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of procedural stroke make a clinically relevant distinction between intra-procedural and postprocedural strokes. Intra-procedural stroke is defined as hypoperfusion due to clamping (CEA) or dilatation (CAS) and embolization from the carotid plaque (both CEA and CAS). Postprocedural stroke can be caused by thrombo-embolisation but seems to have a primarily hemodynamic origin. Besides thrombotic occlusion of the carotid artery, cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) due to extensively increased cerebral revascularization is the most reported pathophysiological mechanism of postprocedural stroke. Multiple technical improvements have attempted to lower the risk of periprocedural stroke. The introduction of antiplatelet therapy (APT) has significantly reduced the risk of thromboembolic events in patients with carotid stenosis. Over the years, recommendations regarding APT changed. While for a long time APT was discontinued prior to surgery because of a fear of increased bleeding risk, nowadays continuation of APT during carotid intervention (aspirin monotherapy or even dual APT including clopidogrel) is found to be safe and effective. In CAS patients, dual APT up to three months' postprocedural is considered best. Stent design and cerebral protection devices (CPD) for CAS procedure are continuously under development. Trials have suggested a benefit of closed-cell stent design over open-cell stent design in order to reduce procedural stroke, while the benefit of CPD during stenting is still a matter of debate. Although CPD reduce the risk of procedural stroke, a higher number of new ischemic brain lesions detected on diffusion weighted imaging was found in patients treated with CPD. In patients undergoing CEA under general anesthesia, adequate use of cerebral monitoring (EEG and transcranial Doppler [TCD]) has reduced the number of intraoperative stroke by detecting embolization and thereby guiding the surgeon to adjust his technique or to selectively shunt the carotid artery. In addition, TCD is able to adequately identify and exclude patients at risk for CHS. For CAS, the additional value of periprocedural cerebral monitoring to prevent strokes needs urgent attention. In conclusion, this review provides an overview of the pathophysiological mechanism of stroke following carotid revascularization (both CAS and CEA) and of the technical improvements that have contributed to reducing this stroke risk.",,Leonie M Fassaert;Gert J de Borst

In younger patients this is often due to carotid artery dissection, while in older people this most likely results from cardiac embolism or thrombosis secondary to high-grade stenosis at the carotid bifurcation. Interventional techniques aim at recanalization of the carotid artery for early restoration of cerebral blood flow and secondary prevention of future strokes. In chronic ICA occlusion the ischemic infarct may be related to hemodynamic compromise. In this situation, extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery was introduced, but its role remains still unclear. Ischemic stroke may also occur in patients with a chronic occlusion of the contralateral ICA. This situation demands the usual stroke treatment, but surgical and neuroradiological interventions face a higher risk than unilateral vascular pathology.

Results from the French enquiry into maternal deaths, 2010-2012]","Stroke is a rare event during pregnancy (10/100,000) and can be ischemic (24%), hemorrhagic (74%) or both (2%). Pregnancy probably increases the risk even if it is discussed for arteriovenous malformation (AVM), aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and cavernomas. Between 2010 and 2012, 31 maternal deaths were associated with stroke. In 22 cases, stroke was the direct cause of death giving a maternal mortality ratio of 0,9/100,000 witch is not different from the former report (2007-2009). There were 2 cerebral thrombophlebitis, 2 ischemic strokes and 18 hemorrhagic strokes (4 SAH, 2 AVM). These deaths occurred during ongoing pregnancy in 5 cases (25%), after miscarriage in 1 case (5%) and in the post-partum period in 14 cases (70%). In this last situation, stroke occurred before delivery in 4 cases and during the post-partum period in 9 cases (1 to 9 days) (1 unknown). There were 7 vaginal deliveries (50%) and 6 emergency cesarean sections (43%) (1 unknown). Most of those deaths were considered to be unavoidable (13/17, 76%). Four deaths were considered by the experts as being possibly avoidable (delay diagnosis, diagnostic error, inadequate treatment, lake of interruption of the pregnancy). Analyzing those deaths remind that any sudden, severe and unusual headache must be explored and that pregnancy does not contraindicate any of the diagnostic examinations (TDM, angio-TDM, MRI) or invasive treatments (surgery, arterio-embolization, fibrinolysis) necessary for its management.

Overt strokes are typically due to large-artery vasculopathy affecting the intracranial internal carotid arteries and proximal middle cerebral arteries, whereas silent strokes typically occur in the territory of penetrating arteries. The sickled red blood cell can contribute to the pathogenesis of stroke via abnormal adherence to the vascular endothelium and by haemolysis, which results in endothelial cell activation, a hypercoaguable state, and alterations in vasomotor tone. Red-blood-cell transfusion, the most common preventive measure for stroke in sickle-cell disease, is associated with iron overload in chronic disease. Therefore, interventions directed towards the potential mechanisms that promote vasculopathy and occlusion in sickle-cell anaemia should be investigated.

BP variability was defined as the coefficient of variation (CV) across these 3 visits. Over a median follow-up of 3.0 years, we identified 582 first stroke cases. Of these, 489 (84.0%) were ischemic strokes and 94 (16.2%) were hemorrhagic strokes. After multivariable adjustment, the hazard ratios (HR) (95% Confidence Intervals, CI) of comparing participants in the highest versus lowest quartile of CV of systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 1.44 (1.11, 1.87) for any stroke, 1.33 (1.00, 1.77) for ischemic stroke, and 2.17 (1.09, 4.35) for hemorrhagic stroke. Similar results were also observed when the CV of SBP was considered as a continuous exposure variable (per SD increase). Moreover, higher variability of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was also significantly associated with the risk of any stroke and specifically with hemorrhagic stroke, but not with ischemic stroke.

For the majority of ischaemic strokes, the aetiology can be readily identified, but in at least 30% of cases, the exact aetiology cannot be determined using existing investigative protocols. Such strokes are classed as 'cryptogenic' or as a stroke of unknown origin. However, there exists substantial variation in clinical practice when investigating cases of seemingly cryptogenic stroke, often reflecting local service availability and the preferences of treating clinicians.

Consecutively we included 33 nocturnal and 54 diurnal strokes. Baseline characteristics, known risk factors, stroke severity and topology were not different between groups. The mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level was significantly higher amongst patients with nocturnal strokes (133.3 +/- 35.2 mg/dl vs. 115.5 +/- 39.8 mg/dl; P = 0.04), as well as the proportion of patients with any dyslipidemia (94% vs. 77.8%; P = 0.047).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15898183/,Stroke and bleeding as an endpoint in atrial fibrillation studies,"Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia and is an independent risk factor for stroke and dementia. Stroke endpoints in atrial fibrillation (AF) studies have been defined differently in the past. Consensus is needed in future AF trials and therefore endpoints should be redefined with accuracy. Depending on type of intervention and patient characteristics in the trial, atrial cardioembolic strokes or all strokes should be used. Atrial cardioembolism is very frequent in AF patients and a combined clinical and imaging approach may help to distinguish cardioembolism from other strokes. Accurate identification of type of stroke is mandatory for the optimal evaluation of interventions in AF patients. To that end, cerebrovascular cardiovascular imaging is instrumental. Intracerebral bleeding is an adverse effect of antithrombotic therapy. Therefore, it is an appropriate primary endpoint in trials evaluating antithrombotic strategies. In studies evaluating combined clinical strategies against stroke, i.e., antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic, as well as strategies focused on maintaining vascular integrity, all major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events should be included in the endpoint.

In this phenotype-based classification, every patient is characterized by A-S-C-O: A for atherosclerosis, S for small vessel disease, C for cardiac source, O for other cause. Each of the 4 phenotypes is graded 1, 2, or 3. One for 'definitely a potential cause of the index stroke', 2 for 'causality uncertain', 3 for 'unlikely a direct cause of the index stroke (but disease is present)'. When the disease is completely absent, the grade is 0; when grading is not possible due to insufficient work-up, the grade is 9. For example, a patient with a 70% ipsilateral symptomatic stenosis, leukoaraiosis, atrial fibrillation, and platelet count of 700,000/mm(3) would be classified as A1-S3-C1-O3. The same patient with a 70% ipsilateral stenosis, no brain imaging, normal ECG, and normal cardiac imaging would be identified as A1-S9-C0-O3. By introducing the 'level of diagnostic evidence', this classification recognizes the completeness, the quality, and the timing of the evaluation to grade the underlying diseases. Diagnostic evidence is graded in levels A, B, or C: A for direct demonstration by gold-standard diagnostic tests or criteria, B for indirect evidence or less sensitive or specific tests or criteria, and C for weak evidence in the absence of specific tests or criteria. With this new way of classifying patients, no information is neglected when the diagnosis is made, treatment can be adapted to the observed phenotypes and the most likely etiology (e.g. grade 1 in 1 of the 4 A-S-C-O phenotypes), and analyses in clinical research can be based on 1 of the 4 phenotypes (e.g. for genetic analysis purpose), while clinical trials can focus on 1 or several of these 4 phenotypes (e.g. focus on patients A1-A2-A3).",,P Amarenco;J Bogousslavsky;L R Caplan;G A Donnan;M G Hennerici

Vishnevsky. The authors analysed the results of 630 primary carotid endarterectomies performed for atherosclerosis under general anaesthesia over the period from 2008 to 2010. Tolerance of the brain to carotid clamping was determined by measuring cerebral retrograde arterial pressure. Of the 630 operations, 65 (10.3%) interventions were carried out under temporal internal bypass. It was shown that the incidence rate of perioperative neurological complications among those tolerating carotid artery clamping was slightly lower than in the non-tolerating patients, with the incidence rate of strokes amounting to 1.8 and 3.1%, and that of ""stroke + stroke-related mortality"" amounting to 2.1 and 3.1%, respectively, but the differences were not statistically significant (p>0.5).

Risk factors for stroke have been determined through prospective epidemiologic study. Control of risk factors has been demonstrated to reduce stroke incidence, either through controlled trials or inferred from observational studies. In the past few years, new approaches to the treatment of established risk factors have been discovered. These include aggressive control of hypertension in diabetes patients, prevention of type 2 diabetes through lifestyle modification, carotid endarterectomy for moderate symptomatic carotid stenosis, encouragement of a high level of physical activity, and control of abdominal obesity and elevated body mass index. In addition, new strategies for stroke prevention have been identified, including encouragement of a diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and omega-3 fatty acids, the use of vitamins B12, B6, and folic acid in hyperhomocysteinemia, and moderate alcohol consumption. Clinical trial data support the use of hydroxy-methyl-coenzyme A inhibitors in patients with coronary artery disease, and ramipril in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease and diabetes, for the primary prevention of stroke. New risk factors for stroke are being investigated, including the role of chronic inflammation and infection, and these may provide future strategies for stroke prevention.",,T J Jeerakathil;P A Wolf

However, several reports have been published of patients with ischemic strokes in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 results in blood clots and large vessel strokes need to be defined as it has therapeutic implications. SARS-CoV-2 enters the blood stream by breaching the blood-air barrier via the lung capillary adjacent to the alveolus, and then attaches to the angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptors on the endothelial cells. Once SARS-CoV-2 enters the blood stream, a cascade of events (Steps 1-8) unfolds including accumulation of angiotensin II, reactive oxygen species, endothelial dysfunction, oxidation of beta 2 glycoprotein 1, formation of antiphospholipid antibody complexes promoting platelet aggregation, coagulation cascade, and formation of cross-linked fibrin blood clots, leading to pulmonary emboli (PE) and large vessel strokes seen on angiographic imaging studies. There is emerging evidence for COVID-19 being a blood clotting disorder and SARS-CoV-2 using the respiratory route to enter the blood stream. As the blood-air barrier is breached, varying degrees of collateral damage occur. Although antiviral and immune therapies are studied, the role of blood thinners in the prevention, and management of blood clots in Covid-19 need evaluation. In addition to ventilators and blood thinners, continuous aspiration and clot retrieval devices (approved in Europe, cleared in the United States) or cyclical aspiration devices (approved in Europe) need to be considered for the emergent management of life-threatening clots including PE and large vessel strokes.",Antiphospholipid antibodies; COVID-19; blood clots; stroke; thrombectomy.,Vallabh Janardhan;Vikram Janardhan;Vladimir Kalousek

Risk factors for cerebrovascular disease can be divided into evidence-based risk factors and those with supposed relationship. Strong evidence suggests that current salt consumption is one of the most important factors influencing the increase in blood pressure, along with the risk of cerebrovascular disease. Hypertension is an important modifiable risk factor for stroke. Studies on salt have shown that a decrease in blood pressure is in correlation with lower salt intake. Over-consumption of salt carries a higher risk of cerebrovascular disease in overweight individuals. Conservative estimates suggest that salt intake reduction by 3 g/day could reduce the stroke rate by 13%; this percentage would be almost double if salt intake be reduced by 6 g/day and triple with a 9 g/day reduction. Salt intake reduction by 9 g/day could reduce the stroke rate by almost 30%. This corresponds to about 20,500 prevented strokes each year. There is evidence supporting a positive correlation of salt intake and stroke, independent of hypertension. The introduction of salt reduction proposal should be considered in future updates of recommendations for stroke prevention.",,Vida Demarin;Sandra Morović

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25893476/,Blood pressure control versus atrial fibrillation management in stroke prevention,"Hypertension is one of the major risk factors for atrial fibrillation which in turn is the most prevalent concomitant condition in hypertensive patients. While both these pathological conditions are independent risk factors for stroke, the association of hypertension and atrial fibrillation increases the incidence of disabling strokes. Moreover, documented or silent atrial fibrillation doubles the rate of cardiovascular death. Lowering blood pressure is strongly recommended, particularly for primary stroke prevention. However, a relatively small percentage of hypertensive patients still achieve the recommended blood pressure goals. The management of atrial fibrillation with respect to stroke prevention is changing. New oral anticoagulants represent a major advancement in long-term anticoagulation therapy in non valvular atrial fibrillation.

Eligible studies were classified based on presence or absence of ITB. Hazard ratios (HRs) were pooled using the random-effects model. Eight of 10 (80%) studies were subject to ITB. Pooling studies without ITB indicated no statistically significant reduction in incident strokes (HR 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-1.02]. In conclusion, the pervasiveness of ITB in observational studies precludes definitive conclusions regarding an effect of AF ablation on strokes.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21211742/,Reducing post-stroke disability in diabetic patients,"Stroke is the main cause of acquired disability in adults and is particularly frequent in diabetic patients. Recent data have shown that stroke-related disability may be substantially reduced by emergency treatment of acute stroke in dedicated stroke units and by rapid management of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and minor strokes, which remain too often neglected. Simple clinical scores have been developed to improve pre-hospital diagnosis of acute stroke and risk estimation in patients with TIA or minor stroke. They are simple enough to be adapted in patient education programs and stroke education may reduce stroke-related disability by increasing the number of patients immediately seeking appropriate stroke care. Immediate access to diffusion MRI and intra-cranial MR angiography further improves diagnosis and risk estimation in TIA and minor stroke. Urgent investigations should also include systematic non-invasive and high quality detection of severe carotid stenosis, which requires rapid endarterectomy, and of permanent or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), which requires oral anticoagulation.",,Y Samson

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11011351/,Depression as a contributing factor in cerebrovascular disease,"Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Physical and psychological impairment from stroke may negatively affect quality of life. From a psychological perspective, depression, which is common in stroke patients, may influence functional recovery and possibly mortality after a stroke. Although somewhat controversial, the risk of poststroke depression may be related to lesion location, specifically left anterior or left basal ganglia lesions. Because poststroke depression can affect recovery, treatment with antidepressants may be warranted. Emerging evidence suggests that nortriptyline and fluoxetine may be effective; paroxetine, sertraline, and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have shown efficacy in treating a related phenomenon known as pathologic crying. The influence of depression on the risk of stroke has not been extensively studied; however, several epidemiologic studies raise the possibility that a relation exists. In one study of elderly individuals, higher depressive symptoms increased the risk of stroke. Many older individuals who have depression develop later in life have evidence of subtle cerebrovascular disease. Specifically, silent strokes that do not involve the sensory or motor parts of the brain are quite common in the elderly population. Vascular depression is depression that occurs in patients with cerebrovascular or ischemic changes in the brain. Preliminary evidence indicates that these vascular changes may be related to atherosclerosis, hypertension, or myocardial infarction. However, additional studies are needed to gain a better profile of these patients and to explore potential treatment modalities.",,K R Krishnan

Important parts of secondary prevention regimens are the modification of vascular risk factors and the inhibition of platelet function or anticoagulation if indicated. The inhibition of platelet function is effective in the reduction of secondary vascular events in patients with TIA or stroke. This is true for acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), clopidogrel, and the combination of ASA plus slow-release dipyridamole.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11552061/,Keynote address,"""Acute strokes are here to stay"": this could be the sad conclusion after decades of stroke research. Generalized prevention of ischemic stroke is not fully successful. After the decline in stroke incidence observed by 1970, partly related to better management of vascular risk factors, there has again been an increase in stroke frequency all around the world. This phenomenon may be explained by the lack of educational modalities for modification of lifestyle behavior, the small impact of high-risk individual prevention strategy, and the lack of rationale and guidelines for multiple approaches. In the meantime, the benefits of acute intensive management of stroke have been demonstrated. There is now considerable evidence that careful monitoring and management of general and cerebral functions in a dedicated stroke unit or by a specialized stroke team are superior to management in a neurologic or general ward. Currently, one way of optimizing limited personnel resources is to connect the stroke unit of a main hospital with peripheral hospitals via a computer network. Experts in the central stroke unit can then make on-line evaluations of CT and ultrasound examinations performed in the local hospital and recommend the best course of patient management. This new approach of treating stroke as an emergency will also require educational programs directed at the general public, general practitioners, and primary and emergency department physicians, to teach the recognition of stroke symptoms and the importance of treating stroke with the same urgency as for myocardial infarction (MI).",,C Fieschi;A Falcou

Neuroinflammation, which follows a hemorrhagic stroke, is an important element that involves both acute brain injury and subsequent brain rehabilitation. Therefore, delineating the key inflammatory mediators and deciphering their pathophysiological roles in hemorrhagic strokes is of great importance in the development of novel therapeutic targets for this disease. The NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a multi-protein complex that is localized within the cytoplasm. This NOD-like receptor orchestrates innate immune responses to pathogenic organisms and cell stress through the activation of caspase-1 and the maturation of the proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18. Mounting evidence has demonstrated that when the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated, it exerts harmful effects on brain tissue after a hemorrhagic stroke. This review article summarizes the current knowledge regarding the role and the underlying mechanisms of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathophysiological processes of hemorrhagic strokes. A better understanding of the function and regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in hemorrhagic strokes will provide clues for devising novel therapeutic strategies to fight this disease.",Brain injury; Hemorrhagic stroke; Inflammasome; NLRP3; Neuroinflammation.,Shao-Jun Yang;Gao-Feng Shao;Jiang-Li Chen;Jie Gong

At our hospital, door-to-imaging time is comprised of 2 time periods: the time before a stroke is recognized, followed by the period after the stroke code is called during which the stroke team assesses and brings the patient to the computed tomography scanner. To control for delays due to triage, we isolated the time period after a potential stroke has been recognized, as few studies have examined the biases of stroke code responders. This ""code-to-imaging time"" (CIT) encompassed the time from stroke code activation to initial imaging, and we hypothesized that perception of stroke severity would affect how quickly stroke code responders act. In consecutively admitted ischemic stroke patients at The Mount Sinai Hospital emergency department, we tested associations between National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores (NIHSS), continuously and at different cutoffs, and CIT using spline regression, t tests for univariate analysis, and multivariable linear regression adjusting for age, sex, and race/ethnicity.

The relative risk of stroke is equally high among male and female smokers, and is maximal (compared with non-smokers) n middle age, declining with advancing years. Evidence is also accumulating to implicate pipe and cigar smoking as a risk factor for stroke, and passive exposure to environmental smoke as a risk factor for atherogenesis. The risk of stroke declines considerably and rapidly after stopping smoking, thus supporting a causal relationship, even though it has proved impossible to perform a satisfactory randomised controlled trial.

Cost estimates were based on published epidemiologic data on risks in 3 main prevention scenarios (ie, none or aspirin alone, warfarin in routine care, and warfarin in anticoagulation clinic settings) and 2003 Medicare cost data. According to the model described, the approximately 1.265 million (55%) patients currently not receiving prophylaxis, suffer 58 382 strokes annually with an associated total direct cost to Medicare of dollar 4.8 billion. For the 1.035 million receiving warfarin, 38 468 strokes are predicted every year, costing an estimated dollar 3.1 billion. If 50% of those not receiving warfarin prophylaxis were optimally anticoagulated, 19 380 emboli would be prevented and dollar 1.1 billion would be saved. If 50% of those currently receiving warfarin in routine medical care were optimally anticoagulated, 9852 emboli would be prevented and dollar 1.3 billion would be saved. The risk of bleeding increases in the first of these ""what if"" scenarios but drops substantially in the second. These estimates do not account for the costs of optimization. Given the continued underutilization and poor anticoagulation control observed with warfarin, despite 50 years of use and widespread awareness of its effectiveness, the feasibility of achieving the projected 50% increases in optimal usage is questionable. Although efforts to optimize warfarin use must continue, the best opportunity for Medicare or managed care organizations to reduce stroke rates and costs at magnitudes approaching those analyzed in this model may come with use of newer oral anticoagulants that are easier to manage.",,J Jaime Caro

The association of the FHS with the various stroke subtypes has not been adequately studied. The purpose of this study was to assess the association of the FHS with the two major stroke types (cerebral haematomas and ischaemic strokes) and the four stroke subtypes (cardioembolic, large artery disease, small artery disease, and undetermined) in a Greek population. The FHS was obtained from 421 consecutive acute stroke patients and from 239 matched control subjects. Positive FHS was observed in 49% of all stroke patients compared with 28% of the control subjects [adjusted OR=2.06 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.42-3.00)]. Haematomas, ischaemic strokes, and from the ischaemic strokes, both large and small artery disease strokes were strongly associated with positive FHS compared with the control subjects [adjusted OR=2.06 (95% CI 9-3.04), 2.07 (95% CI 1.09-3.91), 2.05 (95% CI 1.24-3.38), and 2.76 (95% CI 1.55-4.91), respectively].

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22552130/,"[Left atrial appendage as a source of stroke: to close (and how), or not to close (and why)]","The left atrial appendage is considered the main source of emboli in strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation. Oral anticoagulant therapy significantly reduces the risk of cerebral embolic events compared to aspirin, but it is associated with bleeding complications, and is not always used. Closure of the left atrial appendage reduces the rate of thromboembolic events, and it is currently recommended in patients with atrial fibrillation submitted to mitral valve surgery. However, the formation of emboli in these patients may be due to other causes, as the role of the atrial appendage could be less important than is assumed. Moreover, not all patients are candidates for oral anticoagulation, and not all are kept in a proper therapeutic range, which could justify the formation of atrial thrombi. There are several methods for performing the closure of the appendage: direct suture in concomitant mitral surgery, epicardial exclusion by stapling or clips, or endovascular occlusion by percutaneous application. However, the results seem inconclusive with regards to their effectiveness for complete occlusion of the appendage, safety, and efficacy in preventing cerebral embolic events. To add to the confusion, some authors reveal no clear benefit in suture closure, and even describe an increased risk of thromboembolism. We present a review of left atrial appendage closure for the prevention of strokes, as well as the different procedures described above.",,R Hernández-Estefanía;B Levy;G Rábago

Aspirin resistance was assessed by thrombelastography in 45 people with ischaemic stroke and 25 controls. Plasma interleukin (IL)-6 was measured. Stroke severity was assessed using the modified Rankin scale and National Institute of Health Stroke Score within 72 h of stroke. Aspirin resistance was more common in the stroke than the control group (67% versus 40%, P=0.028), and within the stroke group the aspirin-resistant group had a higher Rankin score (4.0 versus 2.0, P=0.013). Aspirin resistance was greater in lacunar than embolic strokes (platelet activation 79% versus 59%, P=0.020). The stroke aspirin-resistant group had higher levels of IL-6 than the stroke aspirin-sensitive group (2.4+/-1 versus 1.8+/-0.9 ng/mL, P=0.037). Using multivariate analysis, we examined the interrelationships between aspirin resistance, IL-6, and stroke severity. These analyses showed that IL-6 was independently associated with stroke severity as the outcome (B=3.738, P=0.036), and aspirin resistance was independently associated with IL-6 (B=0.765, P=0.005) as the outcome.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30336461/,Henrik Ibsen's Battle with Cerebrovascular Disease,"Henrik Ibsen (1828-1906) is a Norwegian playwright and poet who is known as the father of modern drama. Ibsen was in good health when he announced at his 70th birthday celebration that he intended to continue writing. His last play, When We Dead Awaken, was published in 1899. Why did Ibsen's dramatic writing come to an end? This chapter presents a medical account of Ibsen's health condition during the last 6 years of his life. It is based on a review of a document written by one of his doctors, Edvard Bull (1845-1925), letters, biographic information, and Ibsen's death certificate. The historical material suggests that he suffered from arteriosclerosis and cerebrovascular disease, and that he suffered several strokes, in 1900, 1901, and 1903. He suffered a paresis in his left foot, expressive aphasia, and a right hemiparesis, and he lost the ability to write. There is no evidence that Ibsen was hospitalised. He received medical treatment and care at his home and at a recreational spa. His health condition was unstable, and it is likely that he suffered from a series of smaller strokes in the last years of his life. Ibsen developed signs of heart failure, and he died peacefully from ""paralysis cordis"" at his home on May 23rd, 1906.",,Jan C Frich

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22261539/,New frontiers for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia, affects over 2.5 million people in the USA and is responsible for one fifth of the 700,000 ischemic strokes per year. For the last 50 years, long-term anticoagulation with warfarin has been the most effective therapy for preventing stroke in patients with AF and other risk factors. However, many AF patients are poor candidates for this treatment, and management of the drug can be challenging. Such challenges include the need for frequent monitoring, interactions with food and other medications, variability in metabolism and a delayed onset of action. Antiplatelet therapy has also been evaluated, and though it is not as effective at preventing ischemic strokes, it may provide some benefit for patients who cannot tolerate warfarin. Recent clinical trials have tested pharmacologic alternatives to warfarin, and new treatment options have emerged. Of these alternatives, the direct oral thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and the oral factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban, which have minimal interactions and require no INR monitoring, have already been approved by the FDA. The field may soon be further expanded as the oral factor Xa inhibitor apixaban has shown promise in its recent phase 3 trial and is under consideration for FDA approval. Nonpharmacologic approaches to stroke prevention in AF are under development as well. These approaches focus on occlusion or ligation of the left atrial appendage, which is frequently the location of thrombus formation. While such procedures have been done often during other cardiac surgeries, newer methods have focused on percutaneous techniques, including ones that may not require anticoagulation afterwards. In addition, new diagnostic modalities may detect paroxysmal AF with more sensitivity, potentially expanding the population to be treated and the potential impact of stroke preventive strategies on the population. This review provides a practical guide to current treatment and diagnostic options and focuses on emerging therapies.",,Vinayak Prasad;Rachel M Kaplan;Rod S Passman
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17082166/,"The cognitive, emotional, and social sequelae of stroke: psychological and ethical concerns in post-stroke adaptation","In the clinical domain, ethical analyses involve examination of complex individual responses, psychological processes, and social context. Psychological aspects of stroke adaptation include the risk for depression and anxiety, changes in identity and personality processes, and potential for social isolation. Depression and anxiety are heterogeneous constructs and can affect individuals' emotional functioning and cognitive abilities. Executive function, self-agency, and volition may be affected. Alterations in identity and personality may also result from the interaction of fluctuating emotional, cognitive, and physical abilities as well as from changes in social context and family dynamics. Social isolation, or lack of access to social contact or resources, can be a consequence of difficulties in cognitive and emotional function that influence interpersonal relationships, changes in social roles, communication difficulties, and challenges in transportation and employment. Social stigma and marginalization also contribute to isolation. The authors describe these psychological phenomena in the context of brain damage and recovery and raise ethical concerns including impact on decision-making capacity, pre- and postinjury selves and interests, and the social milieu in which strokes are experienced.",,Debjani Mukherjee;Rebecca L Levin;Wendy Heller

Prompt diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment are substantial for the prevention of subsequent embolization that would result in further clinical deterioration. Among other clinical investigations, transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring is highly efficacious for the detection of microembolic signals (MES) that correspond to microthrombi entering the intracranial circulation. The presence and burden of MES, especially in multiple intracranial arteries, is clearly associated with an increased risk of symptomatic, recurrent embolization, and thus can justify a more aggressive treatment approach (clopidogrel load followed by dual antiplatelet therapy or alternatively therapeutic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin). In this narrative review, we discuss the most important causes of multi-territory embolic ischemic strokes and also underscore the utility of TCD as a noninvasive tool for the diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment.",antiphospholipid syndrome; microembolic signals; stroke; transcranial Doppler.,Odysseas Kargiotis;Klearchos Psychogios;Apostolos Safouris;Georgios Magoufis;Paschalis D Zervas;Eleftherios Stamboulis;Georgios Tsivgoulis

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12516007/,Stroke in the elderly,"Stroke is one of the oldest but least understood diseases, and it is one of the major public health problems facing the elderly. Recent epidemiological investigations have found that the incidence of stroke has been underestimated by about 50%, and that the burden of disease is highest in minority populations. Recent clinical and basic neuroscience research indicates that stroke is neither unpredictable nor irreversible. Many risk factors for stroke are readily identifiable, and evidence-based treatment may be used to reduce the likelihood of stroke among those at risk. Rapid diagnosis and evaluation of stroke and transient ischemic attack and their treatment, including surgery, anticoagulation, antiplatelet and other medical therapies, reduce the chance of recurrence. More aggressive treatment of blood pressure, even among patients who are not necessarily hypertensive, may also reduce the risk of future strokes. Once ischemic stroke has occurred, emergent therapy using thrombolysis may significantly reduce disability, even among the elderly.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11221939/,Causes of perioperative stroke after carotid endarterectomy: special considerations in symptomatic patients,"In order to maximize the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy (CEA), the rate of perioperative stroke must be kept to a minimum. A recent analysis of carotid surgery at our institution found that most perioperative strokes were due to technical errors resulting in thrombosis or embolization. From 1992 through 1997 we have performed nearly 1200 additional CEAs; the purpose of this study was to examine recent trends in the causes of perioperative stroke, with specific attention to differences in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The records of 1041 patients undergoing 1165 CEAs were reviewed from a prospectively compiled database. Analysis of these data showed that a history of preoperative stroke appears to increase the risk of perioperative stroke after CEA. Surgical factors associated with perioperative stroke include an inability to tolerate clamping, use of an intraarterial shunt, and having surgery performed under general anesthesia; these factors are clearly interrelated and only the use of intraarterial shunting remains a risk factor by multivariate analysis. Over half of all perioperative strokes (54%) appear to be caused by intraoperative or postoperative thrombosis and embolization. The patient requiring use of intraarterial shunting and/or with a preoperative stroke most likely has a significant watershed area of brain at increased risk of infarction. However, technical errors are still the most common cause of perioperative stroke in these high-risk patients. Such high-risk patients may manifest clinical stroke from small emboli that may be tolerated by asymptomatic clamp-tolerant patients. Technical precision and appropriate cerebral protection are particularly critical for successful outcomes in high-risk patients.",,G R Jacobowitz;C B Rockman;P J Lamparello;M A Adelman;A Schanzer;D Woo;R Landis;P J Gagne;T S Riles;A M Imparato

Several clinical and autopsy studies have suggested an increased incidence of strokes in HIV-infected persons. These studies have been performed on diverse populations with numerous confounds for strokes, including, drug abuse and coexistent opportunistic infection. Because of these confounding factors, it has been difficult to assess whether a unique stroke propensity exists among HIV-infected persons. A retrospective case-controlled study was carried out of patients registered in the Durban Stroke Data Bank (DSDB) (n=1298) located in KwaZulu Natal province of South Africa. Sixteen per cent of all strokes in young (<50 year old) black Africans living in KwaZulu Natal province on the east coast of South Africa reported to the DSDB occurred in association with HIV infection. This HIV-infected population was free of drug abuse and relatively devoid of opportunistic infections. The incidence rate of HIV in this stroke population paralleled that of the young black population at large, suggesting no significant overall increased rate of stroke in association with HIV. However, when compared to strokes occurring in an age- and sex-matched, HIV-seronegative control population, the cryptogenic stroke was more common in the HIV-infected population. Although the incidence of rate of stroke appeared to be no higher among HIV-infected young black Africans in the KwaZulu province than among HIV-seronegative controls, the increased incidence of a large vessel cryptogenic stroke in the former suggests the presence of a co-existent prothromobotic state.",,M Hoffmann;J R Berger;A Nath;M Rayens
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12574943/,Brain embolism - Answers to practical questions,"Embolism of cardiac origin accounts for about 1/4 of ischemic strokes. Strokes due to cardioembolism are in general severe and prone to early and long-term recurrence. Cardioembolism can be reliably suspected in clinical grounds but is often difficult to document. Magnetic resonance imaging, transcranial Doppler, echocardiogram, Holter and electrophysiological studies can help to demonstrate the source of cardioembolism. Aortic arch atheroma is an emerging embolic source, but non-valvular atrial fibrillation remains the commonest cause of cardioembolic stroke. Despite its preventive potential, continuous oral anticoagulation is prescribed for less than half of the patients with atrial fibrillation with risk factors for embolism and no contraindications for anticoagulation.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25867760/,Cryptogenic Stroke: Making the Management Less Cryptic,"Cryptogenic stroke (CS) accounts for 20% to 40% of ischemic strokes. CS is defined as a cortical infarct suggestive of an embolic stroke with no identifiable cardiac etiology, large vessel occlusive disease, or small vessel lacunar stroke. The likely etiologies for CS are patent foramen ovale (PFO) and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which can be detected by transesophageal echocardiography and long-term cardiac rhythm monitoring. In a busy academic hospital, the stroke service is frequently asked to provide a rational approach to patients with such a presentation. The 2011 American Heart Association/American Stroke Association recommends that antiplatelet therapy is ""reasonable"" (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B) for patients with PFO and a clinical presentation of CS. Confounding PFO management is the lack of a controlled trial comparing anticoagulation with antiplatelet therapy in patients with CS, despite the belief that the primary mechanism of PFO-mediated stroke would be that it serves as a conduit for venous emboli. Data from 3 recent prospective PFO closure device trials further compound the management protocols for these patients. Also complicating the management of CS is increasing evidence that paroxysmal atrial fibrillation may be found as often as 30% with extensive monitoring and long-term follow-up of 36 months.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11316915/,Atherothrombosis: a major health burden,"Atherosclerosis involves structural change to the intima and media of medium- and large-sized arteries. Although an atherosclerotic plaque may remain clinically silent, it is prone to disruption, leading to local platelet activation and aggregation. Therefore, the major complication of atherosclerosis is thrombosis, with local occlusion or distal embolism - a generalized disease process known as atherothrombosis. The three main clinical manifestations of atherothrombosis are coronary heart disease (myocardial infarction and angina), peripheral arterial disease and cerebral ischaemia. Atherothrombosis is a leading cause of mortality, and stroke is the leading cause of disability in adults, the second most important cause of dementia and the third most common cause of death in Western countries. Ischaemic stroke accounts for 80% of strokes and atherothrombosis accounts for approximately 20% of all strokes. Criteria for atherothrombotic stroke are evidence of a 50% (or greater) stenosis of a cervical artery and exclusion of other potential causes. The incidence of cerebrovascular events is 2,900 per million inhabitants per year, consisting of 500 transient ischaemic attacks and 2,400 strokes, of which 75% are first-ever stroke. The prevalence of stroke in the same population is 12,000, of which 800 patients (7%) per year have recurrences. The risk of ipsilateral stroke is 5% per year and the risk of a cardiac event is higher at 7%. Besides optimal management of risk factors for atherothrombosis and carotid surgery, antiplatelet therapy is the cornerstone of vascular prevention. In secondary prevention, antiplatelet agents are effective in reducing the risk of further ischaemic events in patients with atherothrombosis. Clopidogrel, a newly licensed ADP receptor antagonist, is the only antiplatelet agent to have demonstrated its superiority versus aspirin for the reduction of major ischaemic events (myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, vascular death) in patients whose initial manifestation of atherothrombosis was one of the three main clinical manifestations of the disease (recent ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, established peripheral arterial disease).",,D Leys

In most health systems, this (unfortunately) means that many vulnerable patients will have suffered their stroke before having had any chance of being considered for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid angioplasty with stenting (CAS). The problem is then compounded by institutional delays in finally undertaking CEA/CAS, which leads to even greater diminishing benefit to the patient. Notwithstanding the fact that the international trials used a 6-month threshold for inclusion, it remains an unpalatable fact that if CEA/CAS is delayed beyond 12 weeks in symptomatic patients with North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) 50% to 99% stenoses, the patient is exposed to all of the risks of intervening, but gains little in the way of long-term stroke prevention.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20454800/,Searching for prognostic variables for secondary worsening after ischaemic stroke,"Secondary worsening of stroke symptoms is described in 13-37% of stroke patients, but the exact mechanism of this phenomenon remains unclear. The aim of this study is to find prognostic variables in correlation to secondary worsening of stroke symptoms in patients with lacunar or cortical strokes. In this prospective observational study we included all patients with ischaemic stroke; patients with transient ischaemic attack were excluded. Patients undergoing thrombolysis and becoming symptom-free after 24 h were still included in our analyses. Secondary worsening of stroke symptoms was defined as an increase of two or more points on the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS). The NIHSS score was assessed on admission, at discharge, and when patients had symptoms that indicated worsening of stroke. Applying univariate and multivariable analysis, we studied the relation between symptoms indicating secondary worsening of stroke and prognostic variables such as extreme nocturnal blood pressure falls (>20% of the average blood pressure), infection, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidaemia, a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease and thrombolysis. This study included 202 patients with a mean age of 72 years, 48.8% were men and 43% had a lacunar stroke. Secondary worsening of stroke symptoms occurred in 13.5% of all patients, more often but not significantly (NS) after lacunar than cortical strokes (16.8 and 11.4%, respectively), and in patients with extreme nocturnal blood pressure falls versus without (15.6 and 11.8%, respectively (NS)).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33782355/,Carotid Web and Ischemic Stroke: A Primer for Nursing,"BACKGROUND: Carotid artery web may cause ischemic stroke and affects a vulnerable population of mostly younger patients. Multiple treatment options and lack of diagnostic consensus can cause confusion and reduce the likelihood to follow the recommended follow-up care. METHODS: We reviewed relevant literature using the following keywords: carotid web, CW, risk factors, stroke, treatments, education, incidence, prevalence, diagnostics, and nursing care. RESULTS: CW is commonly missed or misdiagnosed, which has led to scarce prevalence data. It has been reported to potentially represent approximately 0.5% of all ischemic strokes; however, after appropriate workup of patients with no clear stroke etiology, as many as 9.4% to 37% were found to have CW. This fibrotic shelflike lesion in the internal carotid bifurcation leads to flow disruption and possible thrombus formation. Treatment options include dual antiplatelets and anticoagulation or more invasive options such as revascularization with surgical excision or stenting, but research remains limited on which could be most beneficial. CONCLUSION: With multiple options and the uncertainty of which are best, patients can be lost to follow-up because of confusion and stress.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15821451/,Managing the patient at risk for a second stroke,"Cerebrovascular disease is a major cause of mortality world-wide, and the prevalence is expected to increase as a result of projected demographic trends. Aggressive antihypertensive therapy is one intervention that has proven highly effective in reducing the risk of stroke, with relatively small blood pressure reductions affording measurable benefit even in patients not conventionally considered hypertensive. Comparative clinical trials are revealing evidence of differential impacts of antihypertensive classes on the incidence of cerebrovascular disease that will probably be important for therapeutic choice in patients with risk factors for stroke. In particular, the role of the renin-angiotensin system in cerebrovascular disease has come under scrutiny as a result of evidence that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), but perhaps not angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, can reduce the risk of a first stroke to a greater degree than might be expected from their effects on blood pressure alone. Although preclinical evidence suggests that there are differential effects of the type 1 and type 2 receptor activation, the clinical relevance of this is not yet known. Furthermore, the effect on the incidence of stroke conferred by blood pressure control in the early morning hours - the time when the incidence of strokes peaks--has not been tested. Some evidence for the beneficial effect of an ARB on secondary stroke prevention comes from the MOrbidity and mortality after Stroke --Eprosartan compared with nitrendipine in Secondary prevention study (MOSES), which showed that the ARB protected against cerebro- and cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients with a previous stroke over and above the protection offered by blood pressure control.

Results of recent meta-analyses report that the treatment is safe. However, the endpoints recurrent stroke, vasospasms, and subarachnoid hemorrhage have not been evaluated sufficiently. Hence, we extracted data on these outcomes from the five recent thrombectomy trials (MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, REVASCAT, SWIFT PRIME, and EXTEND IA published in 2015). Subsequently, we conducted meta-analyses for each outcome. We report the results of the fixed, as well as the random effects model. Three studies reported data on recurrent strokes. While the results did not reach statistical significance in the random effects model (despite a three times elevated risk), the fixed effects model revealed a significantly higher rate of recurrent strokes after thrombectomy. Four studies reported data on subarachnoid hemorrhage. The higher pooled rates in the intervention groups were statistically significant in both, the fixed and the random effects model. One study reported on vasospasms. We recorded 14 events in the intervention group and none in the control group. The efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy is not questioned, yet our results indicate an increased risk for recurrent strokes, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and vasospasms post-treatment.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11903323/,Progress in reducing the burden of stroke,"1. The burden of stroke worldwide is growing rapidly, driven by an ageing population and by the rapid rate of urbanization and industrialization in the developing world. There are approximately 5 million fatal and 15 million non-fatal strokes each year and over 50 million survivors of stroke alive, worldwide, today. 2. The most important determinant of stroke risk is blood pressure, with a strong, continuous relationship between the level of the systolic and diastolic pressures and the risk of initial and recurrent stroke, in both Western and Asian populations. 3. Randomized clinical trials have clearly demonstrated that blood pressure lowering reduces the risk of initial stroke by 35-40% in hypertensive patients; but, until recently, there was no conclusive evidence that blood pressure lowering was effective in the secondary prevention of stroke. 4. The Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) has provided definitive evidence that blood pressure lowering in patients with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) reduces the incidence of secondary stroke by 28%, of major vascular events by 26% and of major coronary events by 26%. These reductions were all magnified by approximately 50% in a subgroup of patients in whom the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril was routinely combined with the diuretic indapamide. 5.

Delayed presentation of strokes is a problem as some in the general population defer the decision to seek immediate medical attention fearing contracting the virus. Also playing a role is the paucity of healthcare professionals available during a pandemic. Recent literature demonstrates the association of acute strokes in young patients with COVID-19. Lack of clear pathophysiology of the neurological manifestations from COVID-19 intensifies the problem. A thorough examination of the intensive care unit patient has always been a challenge owing to several factors including use of sedatives, sepsis, uremia, and encephalopathy secondary to medications.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34043446/,Stroke Recurrence and Its Relationship With Language Abilities,"Purpose Many factors influence poststroke language recovery, yet little is known about the influence of previous stroke(s) on language after left hemisphere stroke. In this prospective longitudinal study, we investigated the role of prior stroke on language abilities following an acute left hemisphere ischemic stroke, while controlling for demographic and stroke-related factors, and examined if earlier stroke impacted language recovery at a chronic time point. Method Participants (n = 122) with acute left hemisphere ischemic stroke completed language evaluation and clinical neuroimaging. They were divided into two groups: single stroke (SS; n = 79) or recurrent stroke (RS; n = 43). A subset of participants (n = 31) completed chronic-stage re-evaluation. Factors studied included age, education, diabetes and hypertension diagnoses, lesion volume and broad location, group status, aphasia prevalence, and language scores. Results Groups did not differ in language performance across time points. The only significant group differences were that participants with RS were older, had smaller acute lesions, and were less educated. Stroke group membership (SS vs. RS) was not associated with language performance at either time point. In patients with prior stroke, large acute lesion volumes were associated with acute language performance, whereas both large acute and chronic volumes influenced recovery. Conclusions History of prior stroke in itself may not significantly influence language impairment after an additional acute left hemisphere stroke, unless it contributes substantially to the total volume of infarcted brain tissue. Chronic and acute lesion volumes should be accounted for in studies investigating poststroke language performance and recovery.

Abstract. Intracranial atherosclerotic stenoses are the most common cause of ischemic stroke worldwide. Nowadays, three therapeutic approaches are available for consideration for patients with intracranial atherosclerotic stenoses: A conservative therapy (best medical treatment, management of vascular risk factors and healthy lifestyle), endovascular and surgical therapy. Conservative approach has been recommended for patients with asymptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenoses, as well as for those with symptomatic stenoses. Endovascular therapy should be considered as a treatment option for carefully selected patients with recurrent ischemic strokes attributed to the stenotic artery while receiving best medical therapy. Surgical revascularisation is rarely favored in patients with intracranial stenoses. In patients with extracranial atherosclerotic stenoses, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been associated with a lower risk of death and recurrent stroke when compared to carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS). Especially in elderly patients over 70 years of age CEA is preferred over CAS due to the twofold increased 30-day risk of recurrent stroke or death in patients treated with CAS. Results from contemporary studies using modern techniques and devices are expected. It remains unclear whether patients with asymptomatic extracranial atherosclerotic stenoses receiving best medical treatment would benefit of invasive procedures such as CEA or CAS.",,Marina P Krasteva;Mandy D Müller;Sara M Pilgram-Pastor;Mirjam R Heldner

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24818555/,Stroke: diagnosis and management of acute ischemic stroke,"Acute ischemic stroke is an emergency. Approximately 2 million neurons are lost during each minute of stroke. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator improves the likelihood of a good outcome. However, benefit is heavily time dependent. Patients treated within 90 minutes of symptom onset have better outcomes than those treated beyond that point. Rapid evaluation and management are key, and a minimum number of tests should be obtained before management. Different imaging studies, including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, and perfusion studies, are useful for evaluation of acute stroke. Trade-offs exist between studies, such as better resolution versus greater delay. There is no evidence at present to suggest that additional imaging sequences improve patient outcomes. Intra-arterial management has yet to be proven beneficial to patients who have had strokes. Emergent stenting and sonothrombosis are of uncertain value. Aggressive blood pressure lowering should be avoided early after ischemic stroke. Anticoagulation with heparin or heparinoids is of no benefit to the majority of patients with strokes, and there does not appear to be a role for corticosteroids.

We conducted a prospective cohort study of 5235 men and 8185 women aged 40-79 years at baseline between 1985 and 1994 in four Japanese communities, who were initially free from stroke, coronary heart disease, and medication for hyperuricemia or gout. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate sex-specific hazard ratios of stroke and its types in relation to serum uric acid level. During a median follow-up of 23.1 years, we recorded 1018 (488 men and 530 women) incident strokes, including 222 (99 and 123) intraparenchymal hemorrhages, 113 (33 and 80) subarachnoid hemorrhages and 667 (347 and 320) ischemic strokes. After adjustment for age, community and known cardiovascular risk factors, the multivariable hazard ratios (95% CIs) in the highest vs. lowest quintile of serum uric acid were 1.45 (1.07-1.96) for total stroke, 1.20 (0.65-2.20) for intraparenchymal hemorrhage, 1.46 (0.69-3.09) for subarachnoid hemorrhage and 1.61 (1.07-2.41) for ischemic stroke in women. The corresponding multivariable hazard ratios (95% CIs) in men were 1.02 (0.74-1.35), 0.83 (0.40-1.72), 1.19 (0.38-3.75) and 1.00 (0.70-1.41). Furthermore, those positive associations with risks of total and ischemic strokes in women were more evident in nonusers of antihypertensive medication than the users.

The incidence is about 10 in 100,000 in several Italian studies. In Italy, about 3,300 new cases of juvenile stroke occur each year. Higher incidence rates have been found in the United States and developing countries. Subarachnoid hemorrhage prevails in young cases, compared with the total population of stroke patients. In the subgroup of patients with cerebral infarction, inter-atrial septum defects and inherited thrombophilic disorders seem to play an important role.",,C Gandolfo;M Conti
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26444396/,"Diagnosing Stroke in Acute Vertigo: The HINTS Family of Eye Movement Tests and the Future of the ""Eye ECG""","Patients who present to the emergency department with symptoms of acute vertigo or dizziness are frequently misdiagnosed. Missed opportunities to promptly treat dangerous strokes can result in poor clinical outcomes. Inappropriate testing and incorrect treatments for those with benign peripheral vestibular disorders leads to patient harm and unnecessary costs. Over the past decade, novel bedside approaches to diagnose patients with the acute vestibular syndrome have been developed and refined. A battery of three bedside tests of ocular motor physiology known as ""HINTS"" (head impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) has been shown to identify acute strokes more accurately than even magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion-weighted imaging (MRI-DWI) when applied in the early acute period by eye-movement specialists. Recent advances in lightweight, high-speed video-oculography (VOG) technology have made possible a future in which HINTS might be applied by nonspecialists in frontline care settings using portable VOG. Use of technology to measure eye movements (VOG-HINTS) to diagnose stroke in the acute vestibular syndrome is analogous to the use of electrocardiography (ECG) to diagnose myocardial infarction in acute chest pain. This ""eye ECG"" approach could transform care for patients with acute vertigo and dizziness around the world. In the United States alone, successful implementation would likely result in improved quality of emergency care for hundreds of thousands of peripheral vestibular patients and tens of thousands of stroke patients, as well as an estimated national health care savings of roughly $1 billion per year. In this article, the authors review the origins of the HINTS approach, empiric evidence and pathophysiologic principles supporting its use, and possible uses for the eye ECG in teleconsultation, teaching, and triage.",,David E Newman-Toker;Ian S Curthoys;G Michael Halmagyi
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26756697/,Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation and risk of stroke,"The incidence of atrial fibrillation rises with advancing age. About 10% of patients over 80 years suffer from atrial fibrillation, but episodes are often not recognized. However, about 25% of cryptogenic strokes are caused by asymptomatic atrial fibrillation showing a significant risk of thromboembolism by this condition. New insertable cardiac monitors or wearable sensors offer the opportunity of continuous rhythm monitoring over wider time spans. Thereby, they enable detection of asymptomatic atrial fibrillation episodes. Several lines of evidence point towards an association between duration of asymptomatic episodes and thromboembolic risk. However, definite data on optimal risk stratification and therapy is missing in this collective. Currently, oral anticoagulation should be initiated according to the CHA2DS2VASc Score. Given the better safety profile of direct oral anticoagulants these substances should be preferred. In patients with high bleeding risk and asymptomatic atrial fibrillation, catheter-based left appendage occlusion may represent a valuable alternative to oral anticoagulation.",,P Stachon;I Ahrens;T Faber;C Bode;A Zirlik

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12597607/,Stroke: imaging and differential diagnosis,"Structural and vascular imaging helps to differentiate haemorrhagic from acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and rule out non-stroke causes, as well as identify specific subtypes of stroke such as carotid dissection and venous thrombosis. However, it is negative in most AIS patients within 3-6 hrs of onset and thus does not allow efficient patient classification for management purposes. Physiologic neuroimaging with PET, SPECT and combined diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MR gives access to tissue perfusion and cell function/homeostasis. It has near 100% sensitivity in AIS, even in small cortical or brainstem strokes. In middle-cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, physiologic imaging also allows pathophysiological differentiation into four tissue subtypes: i) already irreversibly damaged (""core""); ii) severely hypoperfused (""penumbra""), which represents the main target for therapy; iii) mildly hypoperfused (""oligaemia""), not at risk of infarction unless secondary complications arise; and iv) reperfused/hyperperfused. PET studies have evidenced the penumbra in man, shown its largely cortical topography, documented its anticipated impact on both acute-stage neurological deficit and recovery therefrom, and shown its persistence up to 16 hrs after stroke onset in some patients. However, some patients acutely exhibit extensive irreversible damage, which places them at considerable risk of malignant MCA infarction, and others early spontaneous reperfusion, which is almost invariably associated with rapid and complete recovery. Thrombolytics and/or neuroprotective agents would therefore be expected to benefit, and hence should ideally be reserved to, only those patients in whom a substantial penumbra is documented by physiologic neuroimaging, even perhaps beyond the 3 to 6 hrs rule. In addition, excluding from thrombolytic therapy those patients with substantial necrotic core should avoid many instances of symptomatic haemorrhagic transformations. Finally, patients with extensive core might benefit from early decompressive surgery, and those with early extensive reperfusion from anti-inflammatory agents. Overall, therefore, the pathophysiologic heterogeneity underlying AIS may account for both the complications from thrombolysis and the limited success of clinical trials of neuroprotective agents, despite apparent benefit in the laboratory. Pathophysiological diagnosis as afforded by neuroimaging should now be incorporated in the design of clinical trials as well as in the routine management of stroke.",,J C Baron

Some clinical manifestations may be similar but others such as ataxia and cranial nerve palsy are more specific. Vertebral artery dissection is the most frequent cause of stroke in the vertebrobasilar territory, but the cause most often remains unknown in children. We report three cases of infratentorial stroke in children. The first observation concerns a 4-year-old boy brought to medical attention because left hemicorporal motor deficit associated with ataxia following a minor cranial traumatism. While computed tomography (CT) of the brain was normal, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an area of signal alteration on the diffusion-weighted image within the right protuberance. The second observation is a 15-year-old girl who developed sudden-onset ataxia. The CT scan and MRI of the brain revealed an acute bilateral cerebellar stroke. MRI angiography showed an anatomical variant of the left vertebral artery that did not participate in the Willis polygon. In these two observations, no other abnormalities were detected except they were homozygotous for MTHFR mutation in the first observation and minor alpha-thalassemia for the second one. The outcome in these two children was good without sequelae after a 6-month follow-up.

Methods A meta-analysis was performed using relevant research from databases such as PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Online Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov. The quality of the studies was evaluated by using the quality evaluation criteria of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). All data were pooled by STATA 12.0 software for meta-analysis. Results The review considered 1650 articles, and 17 articles with 2821 instances of SE among 1088087 instances of stroke were included. The incidence rate of SE after stroke was 6.90 per 1000 total strokes (95% CI: 5.58-8.22). By subgroup analysis of SE, the rates were 33.85‰ (95% CI: 13.77-53.94) for non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) and 2.42‰ (95%CI: 1.66-3.19) for generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE). Age, sex, and presence of atrial fibrillation showed no significant difference between the SE group and the non-SE group after stroke. Hypertension and diabetes are associated with a decreased rate of SE. However, African American race, alcohol abuse, and renal disease are associated with an increased rate of SE. Significance There were approximately 6.9 patients with status epilepticus per 1000 strokes. NCSE is more common after stroke and needs more attention.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18611104/,Managed care considerations,"Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States and among the most costly diseases. Most strokes are categorized as ischemic, and 10% to 15% are preceded by a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Stroke survivors suffer levels of disability and handicap that range from mild to very severe, and they rarely make a complete recovery. Initial stroke patients are at considerable risk for recurrent stroke, which can compound a patient's impairment and associated costs. This article discusses the burden of stroke on patients and caregivers, the risk of stroke recurrence, and the pharmacoeconomics of antiplatelet therapy. Studies show that effective secondary prevention such as antiplatelet therapy can improve clinical outcomes in patients who have experienced TIA or prior stroke. Recently updated guidelines for secondary stroke prevention from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association recommend administering antiplatelet agents rather than anticoagulants for patients who experienced an ischemic noncardioembolic stroke or TIA to reduce the risk of stroke or other cardiovascular events. The guidelines state that aspirin (ASA), ASA + extended-release dipyridamole (DP), and clopidogrel are acceptable initial treatment options for these patients. A recent pharmacoeconomic analysis of all 3 therapies concluded that ASA and ASA + DP offer cost-effective secondary prevention for patients who have suffered a mild initial stroke. Understanding the role of antiplatelet therapy in secondary prevention can help the managed care community optimize clinical and economic outcomes, thereby reducing the overall burden of cerebrovascular disease.",,Jeffrey D Dunn

Strokes in artery of Percheron account for 0.1% to 2% of all cerebral infarctions. Thalamic area is supplied by the arteries arising directly from the P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery. However, in 1/3 of cases the supply is provided by a single trunk referred to as artery of Percheron (AOP). Early diagnosis of stroke in AOP can be very challenging due to an ambiguous clinical presentation and the absence of neurovisualization findings.

During follow-up, there were 161 incident cases of ischemic strokes and 41 incident cases of hemorrhagic strokes. Among MetS components, only the hypertensive trait was associated with significantly elevated risks of both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. Furthermore, MetS with hypertension as components was associated with increased risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes (adjusted hazards ratio (95% confidence interval) was 2.96 (1.94-4.50) and 2.93 (1.25-6.90), respectively) as compared with those who had neither hypertension nor MetS.

Many present weeks after a neurologic deficit has occurred, as is often the case with elderly patients and those in a nursing home. The ability to determine the age of an ischemic stroke provides useful clinical information for the patient, his or her family, and the medical team. Many times, perfusion imaging is not performed, and pulse sequence-specific magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings may help determine the age of the infarct. The findings seen at apparent diffusion coefficient mapping and diffusion-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and unenhanced and contrast material-enhanced T1- and T2-weighted gradient-echo and susceptibility-weighted MR imaging may help determine the relative age of a cerebral infarct. Strokes may be classified and dated as early hyperacute, late hyperacute, acute, subacute, or chronic. Recent data indicate that in many patients with restricted diffusion and no change on FLAIR images, it is more likely than was initially thought that the stroke is less than 6 hours old. The time window to administer intravenous tissue plasminogen activator is currently 4.5 hours from the time when the patient was last seen to be normal, and for anterior circulation strokes, the time window for administering intraarterial tissue plasminogen activator is 6 hours from when the patient was last seen to be normal.

The purpose of this study is to learn 1) if unilateral cerebellar injury might also cause hemispatial neglect, and if so, 2) if there is a left versus right asymmetry, 3) if the neglect is contralesional (CN) or ipsilesional (IN), and 4) if cerebellar injury might induce neglect by disruption of cerebellar-cortical networks. Participants were 28 patients with unilateral cerebellar stroke who were assessed for neglect within 2 months after the onset of stroke. To investigate if the cerebellar-cerebral network dysfunction induced neglect, 12 patients received perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Eight of the participants demonstrated neglect (28.6%), four with left cerebellar strokes (three with CN and one with IN) and four with right cerebellar strokes (three with IN and one with CN). Among five patients with neglect who had undergone SPECT, only one with ipsilesional neglect showed crossed cerebello-cerebral diaschisis. Neglect induced by cerebellar stroke might be more common than previously reported. Based on the cerebellar-cerebral network hypothesis we expected neglect to be more common with left than right cerebellar injury, but there was an equal number of patients with neglect from right and left sided strokes and the SPECT scan did not provide support of this hypothesis. Thus, this hypothesis cannot also explain the equal number of subject with ipsi- and contralesional neglect and in future studies alternative hypotheses such as vestibular hypothesis will have to be explored.",,E J Kim;K D Choi;M K Han;B H Lee;S W Seo;S Y Moon;K M Heilman;D L Na

Herbal medicines, characterized as multi-constituent, multi-target and multi-effect, have been acknowledged with conspicuous effects in treating stroke, and attract extensive interest of researchers although the mechanism of action is yet unclear. In this work, we introduce an innovative systems-pharmacology method that combines pharmacokinetic prescreening, target fishing and network analysis to decipher the mechanisms of action of 10 herbal medicines like Salvia miltiorrhizae, Ginkgo biloba and Ephedrae herba which are efficient in stroke treatment and prevention. Our systematic analysis results display that, in these anti-stroke herbal medicines, 168 out of 1285 constituents with the favorable pharmacokinetic profiles might be implicated in stroke therapy, and the systematic use of these compounds probably acts through multiple mechanisms to synergistically benefit patients with stroke, which can roughly be classified as preventing ischemic inflammatory response, scavenging free radicals and inhibiting neuronal apoptosis against ischemic cerebral damage, as well as exhibiting lipid-lowering, anti-diabetic, anti-thrombotic and antiplatelet effects to decrease recurrent strokes. Relying on systems biology-based analysis, we speculate that herbal medicines, being characterized as the classical combination therapies, might be not only engaged in multiple mechanisms of action to synergistically improve the stroke outcomes, but also might be participated in reducing the risk factors for recurrent strokes.",,Jingxiao Zhang;Yan Li;Xuetong Chen;Yanqiu Pan;Shuwei Zhang;Yonghua Wang

There were examined patients consequently in definite time points after ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes: at hospital stay (234 patients), at 1 month (203), at 3 months (176), at 6 months (156), at 9 months (139) and at 12 months (128). PSF and certain PSF domains were measured by fatigue assessment scale and multidimensional fatigue inventory-20 scale. All PSF cases were divided as early PSF (presented only within the first month after stroke), persistent PSF (presented within the first post-stroke month and later) and late PSF (appeared only at three months observation or later). In univariate logistic regression analysis there were no any significant associations between risk of every time-based PSF types and majority of studied factors. On the other hand, Fazekas scale score was significantly associated with higher risk of persistence of global and mental PSF. Post-stroke functional disability, according to modified Rankin scale, was significantly associated with increased risk of global and physical PSF persistence. Mild cognitive impairments were associated with increased risk of global and mental PSF persistence. The presence of depressive signs at 1 month and 3 months after stroke was significantly associated with increased risk of late PSF (due to increased risk of various PSF components). Management of post-stroke functional abnormalities, mild cognitive impairments and depressive signs probably may be helpful for prevention of early PSF persistence and development of late PSF.",,M Delva;N Lytvynenko;I Delva

However, recent clinical trials have demonstrated that there are numerous opportunities to improve stroke prevention strategies and also opportunities to effectively intervene in and treat acute strokes. For patients with diabetes and for those with prior strokes or transient ischemic attacks, it has become evident that aggressive low-density lipoprotein lowering with statin medications will decrease the risk for total and fatal strokes. Optimal anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy for primary and secondary stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation is being carefully defined. With numerous novel factor Xa and direct thrombin inhibitor drugs completing phase III clinical trials, it is likely that additional oral anticoagulant drugs will be clinically available for stroke prevention soon. Additionally, a major clinical trial is nearing completion that may resolve the role of carotid stenting and carotid endarterectomy in primary and secondary stroke prevention.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24476557/,The economic burden to medicare of stroke events in atrial fibrillation populations with and without thromboprophylaxis,"Some 3 million people in the United States have atrial fibrillation (AF). Without thromboprophylaxis, AF increases overall stroke risk 5-fold. Prevention is paramount as AF-related strokes tend to be severe. Thromboprophylaxis reduces the annual incidence of stroke in AF patients by 22%-62%. However, antithrombotics are prescribed for only about half of appropriate AF patients. The study team estimates the economic implications for Medicare of fewer stroke events resulting from increased thromboprophylaxis among moderate- to high-risk AF patients. The decision model used considers both reduced stroke and increased bleeding risk from thromboprophylaxis for a hypothetical cohort on no thromboprophylaxis (45%), antiplatelets (10%), and anticoagulation (45%). AF prevalence, stroke risk, and stroke risk reduction are adjusted for age, comorbidities, and anticoagulation/antiplatelet status. Health care costs are literature based. At baseline, an estimated 24,677 ischemic strokes, 9127 hemorrhagic strokes, and 9550 bleeding events generate approximately $2.63 billion in annual event-related health care costs to Medicare for every million AF patients eligible for thromboprophylaxis. A 10% increase in anticoagulant use in the untreated population would reduce stroke events by 9%, reduce stroke fatalities by 9%, increase bleed events by 5%, and reduce annual stroke/bleed-related costs to Medicare by about $187 million (7.1%) for every million eligible AF patients. A modest 10% increase in the use of thromboprophylaxis would reduce event-related costs to Medicare by 7.1%, suggesting a compelling economic motivation to improve rates of appropriate thromboprophylaxis.

Latest generation single-chamber ICD allow the additional sensing of atrial tachyarrhythmias and, therefore, contribute to the early detection and treatment of AF, potentially preventing AF-related stroke. The present study aimed to measure the impact on patient-related costs of this new ICD compared to conventional ICD. A Markov model was developed to simulate the long-term incidence of stroke in patients treated with a single-chamber ICD with or without atrial sensing capabilities. The median annual cost per patient and its difference, the number of strokes avoided, and the cost per stroke avoided were estimated. During a 9-year horizon, the costs for the ICD and stroke treatment were €570 per patient-year for an ICD with atrial sensing capabilities and €491 per patient-year for a conventional ICD. Per 1,000 patients, 4.6 strokes per year are assumed to be avoided by the new device. Higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores are associated with higher numbers of avoided strokes and larger potential for cost savings. Apart from clinical advantages, the use of ICD with atrial sensing capabilities may reduce the incidence of stroke and, in high-risk patients, may also contribute to reduce overall health care costs.",,Thomas Reinhold;Roberto Belke;Tino Hauser;Christian Grebmer;Carsten Lennerz;Verena Semmler;Christof Kolb

Primary stroke prevention in children with SCA involves screening for abnormal transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocity coupled with regular blood transfusion therapy for children with abnormal velocities, for at least one year. However, in Africa, where the majority of children with SCA live, regular blood transfusions are not feasible due to inadequate supply of safe blood, cost, and the reluctance of caregivers to accept transfusion therapy for their children. We describe the Primary Prevention of Stroke in Children with Sickle Cell Disease in Nigeria Trial [Stroke Prevention in Nigeria (SPRING) trial, NCT02560935], a three-center double-blinded randomized controlled Phase III clinical trial to 1) determine the efficacy of moderate fixed-dose (20 mg/kg/day) versus low fixed-dose (10 mg/kg/day) hydroxyurea therapy for primary stroke prevention; 2) determine the efficacy of moderate fixed-dose hydroxyurea for decreasing the incidence of all cause-hospitalization (pain, acute chest syndrome, infection, other) compared to low fixed-dose hydroxyurea. We will test the primary hypothesis that there will be a 66% relative risk reduction of strokes in children with SCA and abnormal TCD measurements, randomly allocated, for a minimum of three years to receive moderate fixed-dose versus low fixed-dose hydroxyurea (total n = 220). The results of this trial will advance the care of children with SCA in sub-Saharan Africa, while improving research capacity for future studies to prevent strokes in children with SCA.",Hydroxyurea; Sub-Saharan Africa; primary stroke prevention; sickle cell anemia.,Shehu U Abdullahi;Binta J Wudil;Halima Bello-Manga;Aisha B Musa;Safiya Gambo;Najibah A Galadanci;Hauwa Aminu;Aliyu Tijjani Gaya;Surayya Sanusi;Musa A Tabari;Aisha Galadanci;Awwal Borodo;Muhammed S Abba;Abdu H Dambatta;Lawal Haliru;Awwal Gambo;Holly Cassell;Mark Rodeghier;Djamila L Ghafuri;Brittany V Covert Greene;Kathleen Neville;Adetola A Kassim;Fenella Kirkham;Edwin Trevathan;Lori C Jordan;Muktar H Aliyu;Michael R DeBaun
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17981671/,Posterior circulation stroke and animal models,"The posterior circulation is part of the brain circulation that is subject to stroke. Strokes which involve the posterior circulation account for approximately 25% of all ischemic strokes, and about 10-20% of all hemorrhagic strokes. While the mortality rate from ischemic strokes in posterior circulation could be as low as 4%, the cerebellar and pontine hemorrhages carry a mortality rate close to 20% and 60%, respectively mainly due to brainstem compression secondary to edema or from direct parenchymal damage to vital cardio-respiratory centers. There are very few therapies geared towards neuroprotection or for reduction of edema in the posterior circulation. In fact, most treatments for anterior circulation stroke are commonly used for the posterior circulation, without an adequate study of the benefits and drawbacks. Since multiple neurovascular differences exist between these two circulations, this would imply that additional studies are needed to refine the clinical treatments in the posterior region. This review summarizes the existing animal models for posterior circulation stroke or vascular insufficiency, and discusses the anatomical, histological, neuronal, neurobehavioral and neurovascular differences at the hindbrain in comparison to the forebrain.",,Tim Lekic;John H Zhang

She was admitted to our hospital because of a headache and nausea. On admission, she had a mild disturbance of consciousness and right hemiparesis. Initial MR imaging revealed multiple infarctions in the acute-to-subacute phases in the right cerebellum, left occipital lobe, and bilateral parietal lobes. Her electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation and transesophageal echocardiography revealed the presence of a thrombus at the left atrial appendage, suggesting that she suffered from cardioembolic stroke. Laboratory testing showed elevated free T4 levels and low thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with positive anti-TSH receptor antibodies, indicating untreated Basedow disease. Although treatment with anticoagulants and methimazole was initiated, her postural tremor, tachycardia, and psychosis deteriorated. On the 8th day of admission, thyrotoxic crisis was confirmed. Despite increased doses of methimazole, as well as treatments with inorganic iodine, steroids, and β-blockers, her psychosis prolonged even after her thyroid function was normalized. Long-term use of antipsychotic medications was required to treat her psychosis. In this case, neurotoxicity of the anti-TSH antibodies related to Basedow disease may have caused prolonged psychosis because of the extensive damage to the blood-brain-barrier function following multiple ischemic strokes. Careful observation and treatment are required for psychotic symptoms, in addition to the treatment for acute stroke in such cases, where thyrotoxic crisis is associated with ischemic stroke.",,Shunsuke Kikuchi;Toshiyasu Ogata;Jiro Fukae;Jun Tsugawa;Shinji Ouma;Makito Tanabe;Toshihiko Yanase;Yoshio Tsuboi
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19770536/,Restorative therapy in stroke using stem cells,"The nonregenerative capability of the injured adult brain has been challenged in recent years and neural plasticity has been observed experimentally in both global and focal brain ischemia in animal models. Whether neuro-genesis increases in response to brain lesions or stem cells can be used for transplantation are the potential questions to be answered. Functional recovery may occur in a small or a localized brain injury using rehabilitation measures, but for large ischemic strokes, the restoration may require new synaptic connections within and away from the damaged tissue. In an infarcted area, the ischemic core may not respond to any pharmacological or rehabilitative intervention. For these reasons, the prospects of repairing the neuron system, using cell transplantation seems promising and may offer a unique approach for brain repair and restoration of function. On going animal and human trials have greatly helped us to burgeon our hopes on this method of restorative therapy after stroke. The ultimate aim of any therapeutic strategy is the maximum restoration possible and eventual complete normalcy of function.",,M V Padma Srivastava

In this setting, thrombus in the left atrial appendage has been found to be the source of stroke in 90% of cases. Although oral anticoagulants have been found effective in reducing stroke rates, for a variety of issues, they may only be used in 40% to 50% of patients at increased risk for stroke. Given pathophysiology of stroke, site-specific therapy directed at left atrial appendage occlusion has been now studied for stroke prevention, and one device is FDA approved (Watchman). A meta-analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials and 2 registries with this device documented the following: (1) patients receiving the device had significantly fewer hemorrhagic strokes (hazard ratio 0.22, P=0.004); (2) a significant reduction in cardiovascular or unexplained death (hazard ratio 0.48, P=0.004); (3) more ischemic strokes in the device group; however, when periprocedural events were excluded, the difference was not significant; and (4) a significant reduction in nonprocedural bleeding with the device (hazard ratio 0.51, P=0.006) versus control. At present, the only device approved in the United States is indicated in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with acceptable anatomy who are at increased risk for stroke and would be candidates for anticoagulation in whom there is concern about the risk/benefit ratio for chronic anticoagulation. Unresolved issues include optimal patient selection criteria, the role of devices in patients in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated, and the relative role of novel oral anticoagulants versus the device which has not been tested in randomized trials.",atrial fibrillation; left atrial appendage; randomized controlled trial; stroke; stroke prevention; thrombosis.,David R Holmes Jr;Vivek Y Reddy

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24484464/,Stroke subtypes and their possible implication in stroke prevention drug strategies,"Thrombotic strokes can affect large or small arteries in the brain. Drugs to prevent atherosclerosis complication such as thrombotic strokes, should be drugs able to prevent the accumulation of intravascular fat, reduce vascular proliferation, decrease blood pressure levels with the resulting shear stress, reduce platelet aggregation, and possibly partially or totally reverse carotid plaques. Any of the commonly used antihypertensive drugs lower the incidence of stroke, with larger reductions in BP resulting in larger reductions in risk. Experimental and clinical data suggest that reducing the activity of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) may have beneficial effects beyond the lowering of blood pressure to reduce stroke incidence. In clinical trials, statins consistently reduced the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with or without CHD whereas the data on the effects of other lipid modifying drugs on stroke risk are limited. Approximately 25% of strokes are recurrent. Antiplatelet therapy is indicated for the prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with a history of noncardioembolic minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Although clinicians may choose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) as first-line therapy for secondary prevention, clinical guidelines and evidence from trials suggest that ASA may not be the most effective strategy. A recent review discussed results from clinical trials that have compared the efficacy of ASA monotherapy versus ASA + extended release dipyridamole in secondary stroke prevention. Therefore it is difficult to extrapolate the real benefit of pharmacological prevention strategies against atherothrombotic subtype for excellence in the TOAST classification subtype that is represented by the LAAS and also with regard to lacunar subtype as an expression of lipohyalinosis process which is a further aspect of atherosclerosis.",,Antonino Tuttolomondo;Rosaria Pecoraro;Domenico Di Raimondo;Valentina Arnao;Giuseppe Clemente;Vittoriano Della Corte;Carlo Maida;Irene Simonetta;Giuseppe Licata;Antonio Pinto

The cerebroprotective effect does not seem to be shared by other drug classes, such as the beta-blockers or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, in patients without manifest cardiovascular disease.

Presence of chronic destructive inflammation in the mouth - a region with rich blood supply, contributes to escape of bacteria, their virulent factors and various pro-inflammatory cells, cytokines and immunologically active substances into the blood stream and their subsequent penetration into different organs and tissues, where they continue in their harmful destruction. Atherosclerosis of cerebral vessels and its consequences resulting in ischaemic stroke are the most frequents cause of acute strokes. Today's knowledge and studies of etiopathogenesis of vascular atherosclerosis present the atherosclerotic process of vascular walls as metabolic, infectious and immunological process, which progressively obliterates vascular lumen and creates conditions for acute and chronic vascular events in various regions. Inflammation is a source of chronic and acute infections in often distal organs and tissues as a risk factor of a atherosclerotic vascular process.

Lingering questions, many of which are the topic of ongoing clinical research, include optimizing individual blood pressure targets, reversal strategies for newer anticoagulant medications, and the role of minimally invasive surgery. Risk stratification models exist, which derive from findings on clinical exam and neuroimaging, but care should be taken to avoid a self-fulfilling prophecy of poor outcome from limiting treatment due to a presumed poor prognosis.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31945213/,"Rapid degeneration of neurons in the penumbra region following a small, focal ischemic stroke","Ischemic stroke causes immediate cell death within the infarct core, whereas cells in the surrounding penumbra region are damaged but can be salvaged. Rapid restoration of blood flow can rescue these cells in the first few hours post-stroke. It remains unclear how long cells within the penumbra region can survive. To address this, we compared the acute cellular response within the ischemic core versus the penumbra region following an Endothelin-1-induced focal ischemic stroke in mice. We used vascular labelling to distinguish the three regions of blood perfusion: the non-perfused core; the hypo-perfused penumbra; and the perfused region. Within 4 hr post-stroke ~80% of neurons died in the non-perfused core, while 40% of neurons died in the hypo-perfused region. From 4 to 24 hr post-stroke, surviving neurons within the hypo-perfused region underwent extensive dendritic and axonal degeneration. Breakdown of the blood brain barrier, microglia activation, monocyte/neutrophil infiltration and astrogliosis, however, was not observed until 24 hr post-stroke. The cellular response within the hypo-perfused region was distinct from the non-perfused core. The core was comprised primarily of infiltrating peripheral monocytes and leukocytes, whereas the hypo-perfused region contained activated microglia and astrocytes. This study shows that small, localized ischemic strokes exhibit altered breakdown of the BBB in comparison with larger strokes. Furthermore, the massive degeneration of neuronal processes within the penumbra region suggests that the timeline to salvage surviving neurons is limited. In summary, the findings from this study reinforce the urgent need for therapeutic strategies targeting the acute hours post-stroke.",Endothelin-1 induced stroke; infarct; mice; perfusion.,Kathleen E Fifield;Jacqueline L Vanderluit

An increase in frequency of acute ischemic strokes has been observed among patients presenting with acute neurologic symptoms during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 and stroke subtypes in patients presenting with acute neurologic symptoms. METHODS. This retrospective case-control study included patients for whom a code for stroke was activated from March 16 to April 30, 2020, at any of six New York City hospitals that are part of a single health system. Demographic data (age, sex, and race or ethnicity), COVID-19 status, stroke-related risk factors, and clinical and imaging findings pertaining to stroke were collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between COVID-19 and stroke subtypes. RESULTS. The study sample consisted of 329 patients for whom a code for stroke was activated (175 [53.2%] men, 154 [46.8%] women; mean age, 66.9 ± 14.9 [SD] years). Among the 329 patients, 35.3% (116) had acute ischemic stroke confirmed with imaging; 21.6% (71) had large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke; and 14.6% (48) had small vessel occlusion (SVO) stroke. Among LVO strokes, the most common location was middle cerebral artery segments M1 and M2 (62.0% [44/71]). Multifocal LVOs were present in 9.9% (7/71) of LVO strokes. COVID-19 was present in 38.3% (126/329) of the patients. The 61.7% (203/329) of patients without COVID-19 formed the negative control group. Among individual stroke-related risk factors, only Hispanic ethnicity was significantly associated with COVID-19 (38.1% of patients with COVID-19 vs 20.7% of patients without COVID-19; p = 0.001). LVO was present in 31.7% of patients with COVID-19 compared with 15.3% of patients without COVID-19 (p = 0.001). SVO was present in 15.9% of patients with COVID-19 and 13.8% of patients without COVID-19 (p = 0.632). In multivariate analysis controlled for race and ethnicity, presence of COVID-19 had a significant independent association with LVO stroke (odds ratio, 2.4) compared with absence of COVID-19 (p = 0.011). CONCLUSION. COVID-19 is associated with LVO strokes but not with SVO strokes. CLINICAL IMPACT. Patients with COVID-19 presenting with acute neurologic symptoms warrant a lower threshold for suspicion of large vessel stroke, and prompt workup for large vessel stroke is recommended.",COVID-19; coronavirus disease; ischemic strokes; large vessel strokes.,Shingo Kihira;Javin Schefflein;Keon Mahmoudi;Brian Rigney;Bradley N Delman;J Mocco;Amish Doshi;Puneet Belani

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24913618/,Spreading depolarization may link migraine and stroke,"Migraine increases the risk of stroke, particularly in young and otherwise healthy adults. Being the most frequent neurological condition, migraine prevalence is on a par with that of other common stroke risk factors, such as diabetes or hypertension. Several patterns of association have emerged: (1) migraine and stroke share a common association (eg, vasculopathies, patent foramen ovale, or pulmonary A-V malformations); (2) injury to the arterial wall such as acute arterial dissections can present as migraine aura attacks or stroke; (3) strokes rarely develop during a migraine attack, as described for ""migrainous stroke."" Increasing experimental evidence suggests that cerebral hyperexcitability and enhanced susceptibility to spreading depolarization, the electrophysiologic event underlying migraine, may serve as a mechanism underlying the migraine-stroke association. Mice carrying human vascular or neuronal migraine mutations exhibit an enhanced susceptibility to spreading depolarization while being particularly vulnerable to cerebral ischemia. The severe stroke phenotype in migraine mutant mice can be prevented by suppressing spreading depolarization. If confirmed in the clinical setting, inhibiting spreading depolarization might protect migraineurs at stroke risk as well as decrease attacks of migraine.",aura; cerebral autosomal arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy; familial hemiplegic migraine; migraine; spreading depolarization; stroke.,Katharina Eikermann-Haerter

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28232661/,Personalized Analysis by Validation of Monte Carlo for Application of Pathways in Cardioembolic Stroke,"BACKGROUND Cardioembolic stroke (CES), which causes 20% cause of all ischemic strokes, is associated with high mortality. Previous studies suggest that pathways play a critical role in the identification and pathogenesis of diseases. We aimed to develop an integrated approach that is able to construct individual networks of pathway cross-talk to quantify differences between patients with CES and controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS One biological data set E-GEOD-58294 was used, including 23 normal controls and 59 CES samples. We used individualized pathway aberrance score (iPAS) to assess pathway statistics of 589 Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) pathways. Random Forest (RF) classification was implemented to calculate the AUC of every network. These procedures were tested by Monte Carlo Cross-Validation for 50 bootstraps. RESULTS A total of 28 networks with AUC >0.9 were found between CES and controls. Among them, 3 networks with AUC=1.0 had the best performance for classification in 50 bootstraps. The 3 pathway networks were able to significantly identify CES versus controls, which showed as biomarkers in the regulation and development of CES. CONCLUSIONS This novel approach could identify 3 networks able to accurately classify CES and normal samples in individuals.

These patients yield significantly elevated thresholds for detection and/or discrimination between forms defined by motion, colour, or line orientation ('texture'). As demonstrated by voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) the underlying lesions involve mainly area human V4 (hV4) located in the posterior third of the fusiform gyrus and extending into the lingual gyrus. Patient's detection thresholds correlate only very weakly between the submodalities tested, indicating partly separate neural networks on mid-level vision for colour, motion, and texture detection. Correlations are far stronger for form discrimination tasks, indicating partly shared mechanisms for even simple form discrimination of distinct visual submodalities. We conclude that deficits of visual perception are far more common after strokes in visual brain areas than is apparent in clinical practice.

Neuropathological criteria were used to differentiate strokes that occurred in early intrauterine development (before 28 weeks gestational age) from those occurring in the last trimester, at birth, or after birth: 19 children had early strokes and 21 late. There was no difference in seizure history or occurrence of febrile convulsions in these two groups. Hippocampal tissue was available in 20 patients; pathology in the hippocampus, remote from the infarcted area, showed a marked difference between early-onset and late-onset groups. Hippocampal sclerosis was uncommon in children with early-onset strokes but developed in most of the children whose strokes were of later origin. However, hippocampal sclerosis was more closely related to a clinical history of a late initial precipitating insult irrespective of infarct timing. These findings demonstrate the changing vulnerability of the developing brain and show that hippocampal pathology is more closely related to the timing of an insult than seizure history or the occurrence of febrile convulsions.",,Waney Squier;Helen Salisbury;Sanjay Sisodiya

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17362840/,"Stroke epidemiology, prevention, and management strategies at a regional level: Latin America and the Caribbean","Stroke is a major health problem in Latin American and Caribbean countries. In this paper, we review the epidemiology, aetiology, and management of stroke in the region based on a systematic search of articles published in Spanish, Portuguese, and English. Stroke mortality is higher than in developed countries but rates are declining. Population-based studies show variations in incidence of strokes: lower rates of ischaemic stroke and similar rates of intracranial haemorrhages, compared with other regions. A significant proportion of strokes in these populations can be attributed to a few preventable risk factors. Some countries have published national clinical guidelines, although much needs to be done in the organisation of care and rehabilitation. Even though the burden of stroke is high, there is a paucity of information for implementing evidence-based management. The Global Stroke Initiative, the WHO STEPS Stroke surveillance, and WHO-PREMISE projects provide opportunities for surveillance at institutional and community levels.",,Pablo M Lavados;Anselm J M Hennis;Jefferson G Fernandes;Marco T Medina;Branca Legetic;Arnold Hoppe;Claudio Sacks;Liliana Jadue;Rodrigo Salinas

In conjunction with the technological advancements in thrombectomy devices, there has been better appreciation of stricter patient selection criteria for endovascular therapy based on pre-procedural imaging, including clot location, infarct volume, and penumbral territory at risk. Pre-procedural imaging performed to assess suitability for endovascular therapy commonly provides information on clot characteristics, such as clot location, length, density, and susceptibility, which can influence and may predict the efficacy of intravenous and endovascular treatments. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the role of clot imaging in acute large vessel occlusion strokes and discuss the relevance of clot imaging to thrombolytic and endovascular therapy.",,Johnny H Wong;Michael P Marks

Our study aimed to test the hypothesis that cerebral T waves are associated with transient cardiac dysfunction. This retrospective study included 800 patients admitted with the primary diagnosis of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke. ECGs were examined for cerebral T waves, defined as T-wave inversion of ≥5 mm depth in ≥4 contiguous precordial leads. Echocardiograms of those meeting these criteria were examined for the presence of left ventricular (LV) wall motion abnormalities. Follow-up evaluation included both ECG and echocardiogram. Of the 800 patients, 17 had cerebral T waves on ECG (2.1%). All 17 patients had ischemic strokes, of which 11 were in the middle cerebral artery distribution (65%), and 2 were cerebellar (12%), whereas the remaining 4 involved other locations. Follow-up ECG showed resolution of the T-wave changes in all 17 patients. Of these patients, 14 (82%) had normal wall motion, and 3 had transient wall motion abnormalities (18%). Two of these patients had Takotsubo-like cardiomyopathy with apical ballooning, and the third had globally reduced LV function. Coronary angiography showed no significant disease to explain the LV dysfunction. In summary, in our cohort of patients with acute stroke, cerebral T waves were rare and occurred only in ischemic stroke. Eighteen percent of patients with cerebral T waves had significant transient wall motion abnormalities.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19102112/,[The management of cerebrovascular events],"Strokes (AVC) represent the 1st cause of death in the department of neurology of Dakar. The main characteristic of stroke is the brutality of the method of formation of neurological deficit. The vascular territory in question amends the clinical expression. Besides the motor deficit stroke can cause neuropsychological disorders affecting language, memory, activity gesture, recognition of oneself and its environment, space and extra corporeal body with the result intellectual deterioration. The mechanisms of stroke are dominated by atherosclerosis and embolic heart disease for ischemic stroke and hypertension and ruptures of vascular malformations for hemorrhagic stroke. CT scan remains the key consideration in determining the nature ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Because of its acuteness and rapid progress to irreversible injury stroke is a dramatically high priority medical emergency. The therapeutic strategy should follow a pattern efficient and fast leading to a specific care, gradual and coordinated by the 3rd hour. There is a need to recognize stroke, what is the nature (ischemic, hemorrhagic) and the cause, in order to consider a therapeutic care consistent. The care must start at the very beginning of the stroke and continued during transportation. In the acute phase of stroke, lower blood pressure should be gradual and it is recommended to respect an HTA in the order of 180/105 mm HG except under certain conditions (acute lung oedema, aortic dissection, infarction acute myocardial) that requires a rapid stabilization of blood pressure. Thrombolysis using alteplase (rt-PA) is called in neurovasalar units in case of stroke seen before the 3rd hour and in the absence of contraindications. Anticoagulants are shown in prevention of recurrence of stroke in the embolic heart disease with high risk of recidivism, in the carotid stenosis or vertebral basilar tight with hemodynamic impact downstream and in the extensive thrombosis. The treatment antiplatelet medication is indicated in other cases. The screening and the control of risk factors for vascular constitute an effective weapon for primary prevention.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15162093/,Sickle cell disease: primary stroke prevention,"Stroke is an important and common complication of sickle cell disease (SCD), affecting children as well as adults. Clinically evident stroke, usually brain infarction, is usually associated with stenosis or occlusion of the intracranial arteries of the Circle of Willis, sometimes with formation of moyamoya (a Japanese word for ""hazy"" or ""like a puff of smoke"" that describes the appearance of a abnormal microvasculature on angiography believed secondary to internal carotid artery stenosis or occlusion and the resultant extensive collateralization). Several types of intracranial hemorrhage are observed but usually in older children and adults. Cerebrovascular diseases restricted to small vessels may go unrecognized but is associated with cognitive and learning problems. Prevention of recurrent stroke has been accomplished with chronic blood transfusion. A primary prevention strategy for clinical stroke, based on the Stroke Prevention in Sickle Cell Anemia Trial, has been tested in a randomized clinical trial. Over 2,000 young children with SCD were screened with transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to detect elevated blood flow velocity indicative of vessel disease and high risk of future stroke. Those randomized to standard care (no transfusion) had a 10%/year risk of stroke, which was reduced >90% with chronic transfusion. This approach is the only primary stroke prevention strategy so far tested in SCD in a randomized controlled trial. Silent lesions on magnetic resonance imaging are associated with an approximately 1.5%/year risk of clinical stroke and a trial is now starting in children with these lesions who do not meet Stroke Prevention in Sickle Cell Anemia Trial criteria for transfusion based on TCD. A controlled trial, based on intervention for nocturnal hypoxemia, is also underway. Hydroxyurea, bone marrow transplantation, antiplatelet, and antithrombotic agents may work but have not been tested in primary prevention in a systematic way. If early and repeated, TCD screening of children, as recommended by National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and the American Stroke Association, were implemented broadly the incidence of new strokes could be greatly reduced in these children.",,Mehari Gebreyohanns;Robert J Adams

The phenotypic variation among patients with HbSS suggests a role for modifier genes and/or environmental influences. To assess the familial component of clinical stroke in HbSS, we estimated the prevalence of clinical stroke among all patients and among HbSS sibling pairs at 9 pediatric centers. The sample included 3425 patients with sickle cell disease who were younger than 21 years, including 2353 patients with HbSS. The stroke prevalence was 4.9% for all genotypes; 7.1% for patients with HbSS; 1.1% for patients with HbSbeta(o) thalassemia; 0.6% for patients with Sbeta(+) thalassemia; and 0% for patients with HbSC. In 207 sibships, more than 1 child had HbSS. There were 42 sibships in which at least 1 sibling had a stroke, and in 10 of the 42, 2 siblings had a stroke. A permutation test indicated that the number of families in which 2 children had strokes was larger than the number expected if strokes were randomly distributed among children in sibships (P =.0012). There was no difference in stroke prevalence based on sex, nor was the mean age at stroke presentation significantly different between singletons and sibships with stroke.

Prominent changes, including emotional, cognitive, and behavioral, in the Central Nervous System (CNS) are observable during the recovery phase of a stroke. Brain ischemia affects a large portion of patients across the world with permanent disability or death. During the ischemic stroke onset, apart from inducing brain damage, existing microglial cells, immune cells, inflammatory factors such as chemokines and cytokines affect the process of brain repair. For the reduction of this damage, there is a need to understand the basic mechanisms involved in ischemic stroke and how to repair it with the help of efficient therapeutic strategies. At present, anti-inflammatory therapeutic measures are the most potent alternatives for its prevention. Due to the existence of various drawbacks in this therapy, newer remedial measures are required to overcome this situation. The most economically efficient treatment option, with lesser side effects, is the utilization of medicinal plants.

The majority of strokes are of ischemic origin, often caused by large- or small-artery atherothrombosis, or cardioembolism. Considering the systemic nature of the atherothrombotic disease process, stroke patients are at increased risk for ischemic events in several vascular territories: cerebral, coronary and peripheral. Due to the limited options for acute stroke therapies, stroke prevention is an important therapeutic approach. In addition to the management of modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia and smoking through pharmacotherapy or lifestyle adjustments, anticoagulants, surgical and perhaps endovascular approaches are indicated in certain patients.

So a relevant question is ""Whose understandings and rules of relevance determine the rehabilitation process?"" In order to answer the above question the aim of this study was twofold. One aim was to explore how stroke survivors under 65 understand and deal with the activities of the rehabilitation process and how they experience having had a stroke. The second aim was to explore how the same patients and their rehabilitation processes were described in medical records, and ultimately to compare the two results. Ten patients were studied during the first 3 months after their strokes. Data consists of transcripts from interviews with the patients and notes from medical documents. Discourse analysis was used as a methodological approach, and in the analysis the focus was upon the discourse, rather than upon the message itself. The discourse of stroke survivors and health care personnel overlap each other to a great extent. The discourse is a biomedical one and both focus on the physical disabilities of the stroke survivors. The subordinate position of the patients and the authoritative position of the health care providers are also valid for both groups. However, there are also differences. While the stroke survivors portray themselves as individuals having had a position in the society, which they want to recapture, they are portrayed as fragmented male or female bodies of a certain age with certain impairments and dysfunction in the medical records.

Fibromuscular dysplasias are non-inflammatory arteriopathies classically described in adults with a cerebral-renal distribution and distinct 'string-of-beads' angiographic appearance. Diagnostic characteristics of paediatric fibromuscular dysplasia are uncharacterized. We aimed to compare pathologically proven versus clinically suspected paediatric fibromuscular dysplasia stroke cases to elucidate diagnostic features. Children in the Canadian Paediatric Ischaemic Stroke Registry, Calgary Paediatric Stroke Program, and published literature were screened for stroke associated with fibromuscular dysplasias or renal arteriopathy. Comparison variables included pathological classification, presentations, stroke types, imaging/angiography, treatments, and outcomes. We report 81 cases (15 new, 66 from the literature). For pathologically proven fibromuscular dysplasia (n = 27), intimal fibroplasia predominated (89%) and none had typical adult medial fibroplasia. Ischaemic strokes predominated (37% haemorrhagic) and were often multifocal (40%). Children often presented early (33% <12 months). Angiography demonstrated focal, stenotic arteriopathy (78%) rather than 'string-of-beads'. Renal arteriopathy (63%) with hypertension (92%) was common, with systemic arteriopathy in 72%, and moyamoya in 35%. Anti-inflammatory (29%) and anti-thrombotic (27%) therapies were inconsistently applied. Outcomes (mean 43 months) were poor in 63%, with stroke recurrence in 36%. Clinically suspected fibromuscular dysplasias (n = 31) were usually older, normotensive with string-of-beads angiography and good outcome. We conclude that fibromuscular dysplasia causes childhood stroke with distinctive clinic-radiological features including hypertension and systemic arteriopathy.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22466872/,Stroke-Unit and emergency medical service: a 48-month experience in northern Italy,"Since the therapeutic window for acute ischaemic stroke is very short, early arrival at emergency care rooms is mandatory. Emergency medical service (EMS), assuring fast patients transportations, plays a fundamental role in the management of stroke. We have prospectively analysed the utilisation of EMS in the management of stroke patients in a countryside area of northern Italy. Among patients presenting with an acute stroke during the period January 2007-December 2010, those with an ascertained time of onset and documented ongoing brain ischaemia at neuroimaging were included in the study. For all of those patients, the personal data, means of arrival, nature of stroke, whether first stroke or recurrence, severity of stroke and the in-hospital outcome were recorded. Of 1,188 patients hospitalised with a definite diagnosis of stroke, 757 patients were included in the study. Of those, 285 patients (37.6 %) were transported by EMS. EMS allowed earlier admissions (75 % within 3 h of stroke onset), but also transportation of patients of an older age (75 vs. 71 years, p < 0.001), and with more severe strokes (62 % of total anterior circulation infarctions). Our study confirms that EMS is essential in delivering the earliest therapy to patients with acute cerebral infarction living in an extra-urban area of northern Italy. However, work is needed in optimising EMS, since transported patients are often not prone to therapy.",,Massimo Camerlingo;Bruno Mario Cesana;Veaceslav Tudose;Giovanni Simoncini;Oliviero Valoti;Emilio Pozzi;Augusto Zaninelli;Carlo Ferrarese

A 63-year-old woman presented with symptoms of headache, jaw claudication, scalp paresthesia, and visual disturbances. A temporal artery biopsy showed GCA. While on prednisone, she suffered ischemic strokes, and serial cerebral angiograms demonstrated bilateral, severe and progressive narrowing of distal vertebral and internal carotid arteries. Despite escalating immunosuppressive therapies, she suffered more infarcts and eventually died. Postmortem examination of arteries showed no active inflammation. A 65-year-old man presented with extrapyramidal symptoms though no symptoms typical of GCA. Imaging showed multiple ischemic strokes. Because serial angiograms demonstrated findings similar to the first patient, he underwent temporal artery biopsy that showed GCA. He died 7 months after his presentation with complications of aggressive immunosuppressive therapy. These two patients confirm that GCA can follow a lethal course despite escalating immunosuppressive therapies. Our two patients were unique in that eventually both anterior and posterior circulations were involved bilaterally in a characteristic location where the arteries penetrate the dura. This pattern should always raise the possibility of GCA and, if confirmed, should prompt aggressive immunosuppressive therapy. The dismal outcomes despite this approach may suggest a non-inflammatory arteriopathy, as seen on necropsy in one of our patients. Such an arteriopathy may require novel therapies to be considered for this severe variant of GCA.",,Christine Lu-Emerson;Melanie Walker;Bertrand R Huber;Basavaraj Ghodke;W T Longstreth Jr;Sandeep P Khot

A total of 41 individual trials including approximately 80,000 subjects and followed for an average of about 4 years were included in the overview. There was a 16% (95% CI, 7-25%) reduction in risk of stroke among treated patients compared to control patients (test for heterogeneity, p = 0.76). When trials that used different interventions were separately examined, a significant reduction in stroke occurrence was observed only for those using statins as active treatment (risk reduction 23%; 95% CI 13-33%). A variance-weighted regression analysis of the logarithmic odds ratios for stroke incidence against the percentage of cholesterol reduction indicated that a reduction of fatal and nonfatal stroke can be obtained for a cholesterol reduction of 9% (95% CI 6.8-13.6%).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29768943/,Early reduced behavioral activity induced by large strokes affects the efficiency of enriched environment in rats,"The majority of stroke patients develop post-stroke fatigue, a symptom which impairs motivation and diminishes the success of rehabilitative interventions. We show that large cortical strokes acutely reduce activity levels in rats for 1-2 weeks as a physiological response paralleled by signs of systemic inflammation. Rats were exposed early (1-2 weeks) or late (3-4 weeks after stroke) to an individually monitored enriched environment to stimulate self-controlled high-intensity sensorimotor training. A group of animals received Anti-Nogo antibodies for the first two weeks after stroke, a neuronal growth promoting immunotherapy already in clinical trials. Early exposure to the enriched environment resulted in poor outcome: Training intensity was correlated to enhanced systemic inflammation and functional impairment. In contrast, animals starting intense sensorimotor training two weeks after stroke preceded by the immunotherapy revealed better recovery with functional outcome positively correlated to the training intensity and the extent of re-innervation of the stroke denervated cervical hemi-cord. Our results suggest stroke-induced fatigue as a biological purposeful reaction of the organism during neuronal remodeling, enabling new circuit formation which will then be stabilized or pruned in the subsequent rehabilitative training phase. However, intense training too early may lead to wrong connections and is thus less effective.",Immune response; immunotherapy; neurorehabilitation; stroke; time windows.,Anna-Sophia Wahl;Eva Erlebach;Biagio Brattoli;Uta Büchler;Julia Kaiser;Benjamin V Ineichen;Alice C Mosberger;Shirin Schneeberger;Stefan Imobersteg;Martin Wieckhorst;Martina Stirn;Aileen Schroeter;Bjoern Ommer;Martin E Schwab

Retrospective analysis of acute ischemic stroke patients with aphasia admitted within 3 hours from symptom onset and treated with IV-rtPA was carried out. Stroke severity, aphasia and global neurological impairment were assessed at admission and 24 hours after thrombolysis. Improvement of aphasia (gain of ⩾ 1 point on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] aphasia score) and global neurological improvement (gain of ⩾ 4 points on the NIHSS) were compared in minor strokes (NIHSS ⩽ 7), moderate strokes (NIHSS 8-15), and major strokes (NIH ⩾ 16). Sixty-nine of 243 stroke patients suffered from aphasia. Improvement of aphasia occurred in 7/16 minor strokes, 11/25 moderate strokes, and 7/28 severe strokes. Improvement of ⩾ 4 points on the NIHSS occurred in 3/16 minor strokes, 17/25 moderate strokes and 15/28 severe strokes. There is a significant (X(2)=4.073, p<0.05) dissociation of recovery of aphasia and that of other neurological deficits between minor versus severe strokes.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24365189/,Carotid artery stenting for stroke prevention,"Stroke is a global epidemic with a significant economic burden to patients, families, and societies at large. In the industrialized world, stroke is the third most common cause of death, the second most common cause of dementia, and the most common reason for acquired disability in adulthood. Overall, 20%-30% of ischemic strokes are related to extracranial carotid artery stenosis. Revascularization with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the gold-standard treatment for patients with significant carotid stenosis. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has become an accepted alternative to CEA over the past decade for patients at high surgical risk, and has progressively evolved into an elegant procedure over the past 3 decades, with dedicated equipment including proximal embolic occlusion devices that have minimized procedural strokes. High-surgical-risk CAS registries have established this procedure as an alternative to CEA for high-risk patients. The Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs Stent Trial (CREST) has shown similar outcomes with CAS and CEA for patients at standard risk, although CAS is associated with higher minor stroke events and CEA is associated with higher myocardial infarction (MI) events. However, CAS is technically challenging and requires a meticulous approach, with a protracted learning curve that should involve experience with > 70 cases. Careful patient selection is instrumental in avoiding procedural complications, and the procedure should be avoided in patients with prohibitive anatomy. This article reviews the use of CAS for extracranial carotid artery stenosis, considering technical aspects, registry and clinical trial outcomes data, determinants of success, and contemporary guidelines.",,Jacqueline Saw

The aim of our study was to provide information about it. We retrospectively analyzed data of patients consecutively admitted to our Stroke Unit along 1 year (2017, November 1st-2018, October 31st). The etiology of ischemic stroke was defined at hospital discharge; ESUS was considered as a subset of cryptogenic stroke, and defined according to the 2014 international criteria. In the analyzed period, 306 patients, 52.3% females, mean age ± SD 77.9 ± 11.9 years, were discharged with diagnosis of ischemic stroke. Ischemic strokes of cardioembolic and lacunar origin were the most frequent subtypes: 30.1% and 29.4%, respectively. Cardioembolic strokes were particularly frequent in patients ≥ 75 years, and almost always associated with atrial fibrillation. Overall, in 80 patients (26.1%) the etiology of stroke was undetermined; in 25 (8.2%) it remained undefined because of death or severe comorbidity, making further diagnostic work-up not worthy. Cryptogenic stroke occurred in 55 patients (18%), and ESUS criteria were satisfied in 39 of them (12.7%). According to age, cryptogenic stroke was diagnosed in 21.1% (21.1% ESUS) of patients < 65 years, 24.2% (19.4% ESUS) of patients aged 65-74 years, 15.5% (9.2% ESUS) of patients ≥ 75 years. After diagnostic work-up, patent foramen ovale was most commonly associated with ESUS (17.9%), especially in patients < 65 years (62.5%); covert paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was detected in 10.5% of ESUS patients ≥ 75 years. In the real world clinical practice, the frequency of ischemic strokes of undetermined etiology, and of those satisfying ESUS criteria, is not negligible, especially in younger patients. A thorough diagnostic work-up, with an age-specific approach, is therefore necessary and of the utmost importance for the identification of stroke etiology, in order to optimize secondary stroke prevention strategies.",Atrial fibrillation; Cryptogenic stroke; Embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS); Ischemic stroke etiology; Patent foramen ovale.,Elisa Grifoni;Davide Giglio;Giulia Guazzini;Eleonora Cosentino;Ester Latini;Alessandro Dei;Attilio Del Rosso;Vincenzo Guarnaccia;Mariella Baldini;Maria Letizia Bartolozzi;Pietro Martinucci;Francesca Sani;Antonio Giordano;Francesca Dainelli;Francesca Maggi;Chiara Giulietti;Mario Romagnoli;Stefano Cinotti;Elena Schipani;Giuseppe Salvatore Murgida;Stefania Di Martino;Andrea Cozzi;Adele Carli Ballola;Debora Dacomo;Debora Valori;Luca Masotti

The aim of this post-hoc subgroup analysis was to investigate the association of specific headache features with stroke location in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Methods In this observational study, patients (mean age: 61.5, 58% males) with ischemic stroke and acute headache (n = 49) were investigated. Infarcts were manually outlined on 3D diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and transformed into standard stereotaxic space; lesions of the left hemisphere were mirrored in the x-axis to allow a voxel-wise group analysis of all patients. We analyzed the association of lesion location and the following phenotypical characteristics by voxel-based symptom lesion mapping: Headache intensity, different qualities of headache (pulsating, tension-type like and stabbing), and the presence of nausea, of cranial autonomic symptoms and of light or noise sensitivity. Results Headache intensity was associated with lesions of the posterior insula, the operculum and the cerebellum. ""Pulsating"" headache occurred with widespread cortical and subcortical strokes. The presence of ""tension-like"" and ""stabbing"" headache was not related to specific lesion patterns. Nausea was associated with lesions in the posterior circulation territory. Cranial-autonomic symptoms were related to lesions of the parietal lobe, the somatosensory cortex (SI) and the middle temporal cortex. The presence of noise sensitivity was associated with cerebellar lesions, whereas light sensitivity was not related to specific lesions in our sample.

Information was collected through electronic search, hand search and contact with experts. Each article was reviewed for relevance and epidemiological rigor. The demographic data were as derived from published government figures. The prevalence from individual studies was pooled and weighted based on sample size. Analysis was done separately for males and females at 10-year intervals (20 years onwards). A total of 7 studies was located, but 2 were discarded. All were done in rural areas except 2 which also included urban areas. The prevalence was estimated as 203 per 100,000 population above 20 years amounting to a total of about 1 million cases. The male to female ratio was 1.7. Around 12% of all strokes occurred in population below 40 years.

A prospective cohort study was performed in 4989 Japanese (1523 men and 3466 women) aged 35 to 79 at baseline with 10 years of follow-up. End points included stroke incidence (total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic). Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios with a 1-SD higher value for each BP index were determined by Cox proportional hazard analyses; Wald chi2 tests were used to compare the strength of relationships. Analyses were also done for each of 4 age-gender groups consisting of men and women aged 35 to 64 and 65 to 79 years. During follow-up, 132 participants developed stroke. Adjusted hazard ratios for all strokes were 1.68 for SBP, 1.72 for DBP, and 1.80 for MBP, which were higher than that for PP (1.34). SBP and DBP were related positively to stroke risk after adjustment of each other. PP was not the strongest predictor in any age-gender groups among 4 BP indexes.

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of depressive symptoms on risk of incident ischemic stroke in elderly according to age and sex. This prospective cohort study followed up 3852 subjects older than 55 years. Baseline depressive symptoms were defined by a score ≥ 5 on the Geriatric Depression Scale or antidepressant intake. The outcome measure was incident ischemic stroke within 6 years of follow-up. Multivariate Cox-proportional hazard models as well as cumulative survival analyses were computed. A total of 156 ischemic strokes occurred during the study period (24 strokes in the age-group<65 years and 132 strokes in the age-group ≥ 65 years). The distribution of strokes in sex-subgroups was 4.5% in men and 3.7% in women. The multivariate analysis showed an elevated stroke risk (Hazard Ratio (HR): 2.84, 95% CI 1.11-7.29, p = 0.030) in subjects from 55 to 64 years with depressive symptoms at baseline but not in subjects older than 65 years. In the multivariate analysis according to sex the risk was increased in women (HR: 1.62, 95% CI 1.02-2.57, P = 0.043) but not in men. The Cox-regression model for interaction showed a significant interaction between age and sex (HR: 3.24, 95% CI 1.21-8.69, P = 0.020).

Stroke can be of two types, ischemic or hemorrhagic, with ischemic stroke accounting for approximately 85% of the total number of strokes. Well-recognized environmental risk factors for stroke include hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and atherosclerosis. Computed tomography (CT) scanning is used to diagnose hemorrhagic stroke but is relatively ineffective and may remain normal in patients with mild ischemic strokes. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is more sensitive in detecting ischemia than CT, especially in the diagnosis of mild stroke but it is still not 100% sensitive or precise. A simple and low-cost, rapid blood test to confirm a clinical and imaging diagnosis of ischemic stroke would be extremely useful. Based on this, the central idea of this paper is to develop a method that would be applicable to a statistically viable sample set to provide candidate biomarkers for distinguishing stroke types. In search of these candidate biomarkers, different analytical separation techniques have been used to screen for major differences in the proteomes of patients plasma samples with proteomics for identification.",,Phanichand Kodali;Agnese Jurkevica;Julio Landero;Christopher Kuhlmann;Joseph Caruso;Opeolu Adeoye

There is significant evidence in literature indicating the better quality assistance SU provide in the treatment of neurological acute disease, with significant improvements in mortality and disability, when the therapeutic intervention (thrombolysis) is carried out within 3 hours after the onset of symptoms. Two are the aims of the present study: to evaluate the economic impact of both the start-up of Stroke Units in the Campania Region and the use of thrombolytic therapy for all treatable population. In the first case, the authors assume charges and costs on the national health service in absence of SU, rather than in the presence of these: the analysis compares the two alternatives to identify the most affordable one. Moreover, the authors try to estimate the potential savings achievable through the use of thrombolytic therapy: savings resulting from the difference between the number of cases treated in 2009 against the targeted population. By the results of the anticipate analysis, the global economic advantage for the Regional Banks is constituted by the sum of the savings hypothesized in two considered hypothesis.

In face of high incidence rates stroke awareness campaigns, close surveillance of vascular risk factors and implementation of hospital stroke units were advanced by the National Health Authorities. To understand the effect of such measures, we assessed changes in stroke incidence and short-term outcome using data from two community-based registers undertaken in Porto in 1998-2000 and 2009-2011. Methods We used standard diagnostic criteria and multiple overlapping sources of case-ascertainment for first-ever strokes. Short-term outcome was measured by the modified Rankin Scale; disabling stroke was defined whenever post-stroke mRS score>pre-stroke mRS and >1. Results Globally, 462 and 405 first-ever stroke cases were registered in 1998-2000 and 2009-2011, respectively. Stroke incidence decreased by 23%, from 261 to 203/100,000 after adjustment for the Portuguese population. Significant reduction was found in those aged <75 years (31%) and in women (32%). Incidence of disabling strokes was reduced by 29%. Fatal strokes decreased by 46%, while intracerebral hemorrhage decreased by 51%. Risk of disability from stroke decreased by 11% (RR = 0.89; 95%CI, 0.81-0.98) in 2009-2011, as found after adjusting for patient/stroke characteristics in a Poisson model. Moreover, when patients arrived hospital within 3 h from stroke onset, the risk of disabling stroke was 0.76 (95%CI, 0.67-0.87) in 2009-2011 vs. 1998-2000, compared to 1.03 (95%CI, 0.89-1.12) for late arrival.

The aim of this study was to evaluate how the therapeutic strategies recommended for secondary prevention after an ischemic stroke are implemented in the real world of clinical practice. All patients admitted for a recurrent ischemic stroke or TIA were prospectively registered. The etiology was determined according to the TOAST classification. The risk factors and cardiovascular treatment at the time of the recurrence were recorded. A total of 168 patients were evaluated. Most of the patients (61%) recurred after 1 year. The recurrent stroke was not associated with a particular etiological subtype. The most frequent risk factor was hypertension (79%), followed by hypercholesterolemia (43%), smoking (25%), and diabetes (22%). Most of the patients had more than 1 risk factor (84%). Hypertension was not satisfactorily controlled in 38% of patients, hypercholesterolemia in 42%, and diabetes in 59%. A significant minority of patients (15%) were not taking any antithrombotic agent despite a history of stroke or TIA. Only 34% of the cases with a known atrial fibrillation were on anticoagulant therapy and the International Normalized Ratio was < 2.0 in 71% of them.

Regular health education and health promotion activities were carried out between 1991 and 2000 in the intervention communities but no special action was taken in the control communities. Both fatal and nonfatal stroke cases were meticulously registered during the study in the two communities to assess the effect of long-term intervention. The trend in stroke incidence and the effect of intervention on stroke incidence were analyzed using a Poisson regression model adjusted for age, sex, year and city. Between 1991 and 2000, 2,273 first-ever stroke cases were registered in the intervention communities and 3,015 in the control communities. Geographic variation and changes in the incidence of stroke and its subtypes were found among these 3 cities. Through 10 years of intervention, incidence risks of all, ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes decreased by 11.4% (relative risk 0.8959; 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.8483-0.9460; p < 0.0001), 13.2% (relative risk 0.8676; 95% CI 0.8054-0.9345; p = 0.0002) and 7.2% (relative risk 0.9283; 95% CI 0.8517-1.0117; p = 0.0899), respectively, in the intervention compared with control communities. Accordingly, comprehensive community-based intervention measures could effectively reduce the incidence of stroke in the population.",,Wen-Zhi Wang;Bin Jiang;Sheng-Ping Wu;Zhen Hong;Qi-Dong Yang;J W Sander;Xiao-Li Du;Qiu-Jiu Bao

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23652453/,Stroke feature and management in dialysis patients,"Strokes remain the major complication among dialysis population as the number of diabetes and elderly is increasing. In chronic hemodialysis patients, prevalence and incidence of stroke is higher than that of the general population. According to the annual registry data of the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy, prevalence of stroke death has been declining, yet the incidence of nonfatal incidence of stroke is not known. Underlying mechanisms of stroke are multiple. Among them, control of hypertension is important for the primary prevention; however, the ideal target level of blood pressure is not determined. Other than hypertension, maintaining good nutritional status is utmost important. Most observational studies suggested that the target was 140/90 mm Hg at prehemodialysis session. However, blood pressure levels are variable in both at office (before and after dialysis session) and at home. It is advisable to measure blood pressure multiple occasions and also at home. In case of acute cerebral hemorrhage, glycerol is indicated to prevent cerebral edema. Blood pressure is recommended to control as systolic <180 mm Hg or mean arterial pressure <130 mm Hg, and lower blood pressure gradually to 80% of the baseline level. In case of acute cerebral infarction hypertension is not treated unless severely hypertensive, systolic >220 mm Hg or diastolic >120 mm Hg and lower blood pressure gradually to 85-90% of the baseline level. Use of warfarin is controversial in case of acute cerebral infarction.

The Finnstroke study,"Post-stroke depression and functional outcome were examined in a population-based stroke register active in four different districts (total population, 134 804) in Finland. Five hundred and ninety four first time strokes were registered. Beck's depression inventory (BDI), with ten as the cutoff point for depression, was applied to 321 of 423 survivors after three months and to 311 of 390 survivors after 12 months. Functional outcome was measured with the Barthel Index (BI) and the Rankin Scale (RS). One hundred and fifty one of 321 (47.0%) and 147 of 311 (47.3%) patients were depressed after three and 12 months, respectively. Depression at three months was associated with poor functional outcome at the one-year follow-up (P = 0.001 for the BI and the RS). On the other hand, poor functional outcome at three months was associated with depression after one year (P = 0.004 and 0.002 for the BI and the RS, respectively). Patients who were depressed at three months were more often in institutional care between three and 12 months later than non-depressed patients (P = 0.005). Post-stroke depression is associated with poor functional recovery of patients. If depression were diagnosed and treated early, it might help patients to recover more completely and/or faster, which could save community healthcare resources by avoiding or shortening the time of institutional care or reducing the need for home care.",,M Kotila;H Numminen;O Waltimo;M Kaste
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31594463/,Does Chronic Kidney Disease Predict Stroke Risk Independent of Blood Pressure?: A Systematic Review and Meta-Regression,"Background and Purpose- Chronic kidney disease is strongly associated with stroke with various purported mechanisms proposed. Low glomerular filtration rate appears to be a risk factor for stroke independent of cardiovascular risk factors in epidemiological studies, but there has been no systematic assessment of the impact of more complete adjustment for blood pressure on the association. Methods- We did a systematic review to February 2018 (MEDLINE/EMBASE) for cohort studies or randomized controlled trials that reported stroke incidence in adults according to baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate. Study and participant characteristics and relative risks (RR) were extracted. Estimates were combined using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed by x2 statistics and I2 and by subgroup strata and meta-regression. Results- We identified 168 studies reporting data on 5 611 939 participants with 115 770 stroke outcomes. Eighty-five studies (3 417 098 participants; 72 996 strokes) provided adequate data for meta-analysis of estimated glomerular filtration rate and stroke risk. Incident stroke risk was increased among participants with estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (RR=1.73; 95% CI, 1.57-1.90; P<0.001), but there was substantial heterogeneity between studies (P<0.0001; I2, 78.5%). Moreover, the association was reduced after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, with progressive attenuation on more thorough adjustment for hypertension: single baseline blood pressure measure (RR=1.63; CI, 1.34-1.99; P<0.001); history or treated hypertension (RR=1.35; CI, 1.24-1.46; P<0.001); multiple blood pressure measurements over months to years (RR=1.10; CI, 1.02-1.18; P=0.01). Conclusions- The association between chronic kidney disease and stroke appears to be highly dependent on the method of adjustment for hypertension. The apparently independent relationship between chronic kidney disease and stroke may be confounded by their shared association with long-term prior blood pressure.",blood pressure; cardiovascular disease; epidemiological studies; glomerular filtration rate; hypertension; stroke.,Dearbhla M Kelly;Peter M Rothwell
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12891675/,Frequency and mechanisms of stroke recurrence after cryptogenic stroke,"The purpose of this study was to better understand the frequency and mechanisms of stroke recurrence after the stroke with no determined cause (NC). We prospectively studied consecutive patients with acute cerebral infarcts. We divided the patients into five groups (large artery disease [LAD], cardioembolism [CE], small artery disease [SAD], two or more causes [TMC], and NC) and registered recurrent strokes and prognosis for 1 year. Those in the NC group were compared with other subtypes. A total of 204 patients were included; 56 LAD, 22 CE, 62 SAD, 27 TMC, and 37 NC. During follow-up, there were 7 deaths and 31 first recurrent strokes. Patients of the NC group showed a significantly higher rate (30%) of recurrent stroke than those of other subtypes (LAD 16%; CE 14%; SAD 2%), and it was associated with the existence of mild stenosis (</=50%) on relevant artery or the stenosis of greater than 50% on nonrelevant artery. Occlusive lesions other than significant stenosis of relevant artery may play an important role in the development of stroke recurrence in patients of the NC group. Therefore, from the therapeutic and prognostic point of view, the detection of such occlusive lesions in patients with cryptogenic stroke may be needed.",,Oh Young Bang;Phil Hyu Lee;Sung Yeol Joo;Jin Soo Lee;In Soo Joo;Kyoon Huh

About 17 million strokes occur worldwide each year. Patients with stroke often require long-term rehabilitation following the acute phase, with ongoing support from the community and nursing home care. Thus, stroke is a devastating disease and a major economic burden on society. In this overview, we discuss current strategies for specific treatment of stroke in the acute phase, focusing on intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy. We will consider two important issues related to intravenous thrombolysis treatments: (i) how to shorten the delay between stroke onset and treatment and (ii) how to reduce the risk of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage. Intravenous thrombolysis has been approved treatment for acute ischaemic stroke in most countries for more than 10 years, with rapid development towards new treatment strategies during that time. Mechanical thrombectomy using a new generation of endovascular tools, stent retrievers, is found to improve functional outcome in combination with pharmacological thrombolysis when indicated. There is an urgent need to increase public awareness of how to recognize a stroke and seek immediate attention from the healthcare system, as well as shorten delays in prehospital and within-hospital settings.",acute stroke therapy; intravenous thrombolysis; mechanical thrombectomy; neurointervention; stroke.,R Mikulik;N Wahlgren

The diagnostic validity of cerebral stroke and ischemic heart disease recorded as the underlying cause of death in Norwegian mortality statistics was assessed by using mortality data of participants in the Bergen Clinical Blood Pressure Study in Norway and autopsy records from the Gade Institute in Bergen. In the 41 years of the study (1965-2005) 4,387 subjects had died and 1,140 (26%) had undergone a post mortem examination; 548 (12%) died from cerebral stroke and 1,120 (24%) from ischemic heart disease according to the mortality statistics, compared to 113 (10%) strokes and 323 (28%) coronary events registered in the autopsy records. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of fatal cerebral strokes in the mortality statistics were 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.66, 0.83] and 0.86 [0.77, 0.92], respectively, whereas those of coronary deaths were 0.87 [0.84, 0.91] and 0.85 [0.81, 0.89] respectively. Cohen's Kappa coefficients were 0.78 [0.72, 0.84] for stroke and 0.80 [0.76, 0.84] for coronary deaths. In addition to female gender and increasing age at death, cerebral stroke was a negative predictor of an autopsy being carried out (odds ratio (OR) 0.69, 95% CI [0.54, 0.87]), whereas death from coronary heart disease was not (OR 1.14, 95% CI [0.97, 1,33]), both adjusted for gender and age at death.

Fortunately, these conflicting data do not belong purely to vorapaxar per se but rather, reflect unreasonably aggressive strategies, including predominantly triple antiplatelet therapy, utilized in both Trial to Assess the Effects of SCH 530348 in Preventing Heart Attack and Stroke in Patients with Arteriosclerosis (TRA2P) and especially in Thrombin-Receptor Antagonist Vorapaxar in Acute Coronary Syndromes (TRACER). The FDA-confirmed evidence strongly suggests that unique pharmacokinetics and a very mild ""comfort zone"" antiplatelet profile makes vorapaxar a good candidate for improved secondary stroke prevention. The outcome-driven, randomized trial should test head-to-head monotherapy with vorapaxar (Zontivity®) versus clopidogrel (Plavix®) and versus dipyridamole with very low dose aspirin (Aggrenox®). The advantages and potential pitfalls of such a trial are discussed in this article.",bleeding; cerebrvascular disease; clinical trials; efficacy; prevention; stroke; vorapaxar.,Victor L Serebruany;Moo Hyun Kim;Seth D Fortmann;Dan F Hanley

The majority of these cases is of an ischemic nature. In spite of the long list of known causes, many strokes remain undetermined, so-called cryptogenic strokes. Increasing evidence indicates that, in the young adults, many cases of cryptogenic stroke are presumably due to paradoxical embolism. In childhood, this is usually not considered, unless in the context of a complex cyanotic heart disease. We present two cases, a 6-year-old boy and an 11-year-old girl who had an episode of cerebral ischemia documented by MRI, and in whom the only anomaly found was a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with intermittent left to right shunt at rest, but with a large right to left shunt during the Valsalva maneuvre. We assumed that, in our cases, in the absence of identifiable causes, the cerebral ischemia was most likely due to paradoxical embolism through the PFO. Of course, as in the adult, the paradoxical embolism could not be proved, but in our opinion it remains the most concrete possibility. Therefore, in presence of a cryptogenic stroke, a PFO should be investigated also in children.",,A Agnetti;N Carano;E Sani;B Tchana;V Allegri;S Bernasconi;U Squarcia

Certain previously unidentified risk factors for stroke can become apparent following admission with acute stroke. The aim of the study was to investigate the prior capture, identification and management of modifiable risk factors for stroke in patients admitted to a hospital following acute stroke. One hundred consecutive stroke patients admitted to a UK hospital were prospectively assessed for modifiable risk factors. The extent of pre-admission risk factor management was also determined. Pre-admission risk factors identified and effectively managed were hypertension in non-diabetics (28%), hypertension in diabetics (7%), previous cerebrovascular event (100%), diabetes (29%), smoking (50% counselled), atrial fibrillation (81%), hypercholesterolaemia (100%), excess alcohol (22% counselled) and obesity (52% counselled).

At present, management strategies for secondary prevention of stroke include aggressive treatment of cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., hypertension, smoking cessation, etc.). Antiplatelet drugs in Japan, namely aspirin and cilostazol, are utilized regularly for the prevention of secondary stroke. While aspirin is beneficial for a wide range of cardiovascular endpoints, including total and ischemic strokes, it is also associated with significantly increased risks for hemorrhagic infarction. Cilostazol, by contrast, has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of recurrent strokes without affecting the occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage. In the Cilostazol Stroke Prevention Study, a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving more than 1000 Japanese patients, cilostazol was found to reduce the risk of secondary stroke by 41.7% compared with placebo, a statistically significant reduction (P = 0.015). The greatest risk reduction (43.4% in cilostazol versus placebo, P = 0.0373) was found in patients who initially had a lacunar infarction, suggesting that cilostazol has a specific effect against small-vessel disease. In addition, cilostazol achieved significant risk reductions on a number of combined endpoints (e.g., cerebral infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, or vascular death), and was associated with benefits in intent-to-treat analyses. These findings indicate that cilostazol may have a role as a vascular neuroprotectant, but the clinical implications are limited by the fact that patients were randomized to placebo instead of aspirin, which is the standard of care.",,Masayasu Matsumoto

The controversy can be explained by assuming that the risk associated with aortic atherosclerosis varies among individuals. Low-risk patients would live longer and have more time to develop calcification. Consequently, calcification would be a sign of low risk. This explains the apparent recurrence-reducing effect of calcification in stroke patients. The association between aortic calcification and stroke found in an autopsy series does not contradict this hypothesis but supports it: application of Berkson's fallacy shows that calcification is linked to lower mortality.",,J Van der Linden;W Van der Linden

Traditionally, oral anticoagulants (OACs) have been the keystone of management for AF in reducing the risk of thromboembolic stroke. However, OACs also pose a non-negligible risk of bleeding with between 30-50% of eligible patients not receiving OACs due to absolute contraindications or perceived increased bleeding risk. New technologies aimed at isolating the LAA through ligation, exclusion, or occlusion are attempting to mitigate the embolic risk posed by LAA thrombi while simultaneously reducing the bleeding risk associated with OAC. In this review, we discuss the safety, efficacy, and clinical utility of these technologies as alternatives to OACs.

Most data on low risk relate to coronary heart disease, not stroke. This population-based, 12-sample, Italian study (Progetto CUORE, 1983-2002), with 10-year follow-up, assessed the relation of low risk to stroke and implications for prevention. At baseline, women and men were 35-69 years of age. Only 3% were low risk; 80% were high risk. Overall, stroke incidence rates were 20.7 for men and 9.6 for women per 10,000 person-years. No strokes occurred in low risk participants, and stroke incidence was low with borderline elevation of only one risk factor. Four modifiable risk factors--elevated blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, and high total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio--related independently to stroke risk. For those at low risk or who had only one unfavorable (but not high) risk factor, the stroke rate was 76% lower than for high risk participants; for all persons not at high risk, the stroke rate was 57% lower than for those at high risk. Results show that favorable risk factor levels assure minimal stroke risk.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17073809/,Neuroprotection and neurosupplementation in ischaemic brain,"Possible strategies for treating ischaemic stroke include: (i) neuroprotection (preventing damaged neurons from undergoing apoptosis in the acute phase of cerebral ischaemia), and (ii) neurosupplementation (the repair of broken neuronal networks with newly born neurons in the chronic phase of cerebral ischaemia). In this paper, we review our recent progress in development of these distinct new strategies for treatment of damaged brain following a stroke. Firstly, we investigated the role of endogenous IL-6 (interleukin-6), which is one of the cytokines drastically induced by ischaemic stimuli, by administering IL-6RA (anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody) to mice. We found that endogenous IL-6 plays a critical role in neuroprotection and that its role may be mediated by STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-3) activation. Secondly, we studied the endogenous sources of the newly born neurons in the ischaemic striatum by region- and cell-type-specific cell labelling techniques. The results revealed that the SVZ (subventricular zone) is the principal source of the neuronal progenitors that migrate laterally towards the infarcted regions, and differentiate into newly born neurons. Finally, we developed a restorative stroke therapy with a bio-affinitive scaffold, which is an appropriate poly-porous structure releasing bioactive substances such as neurotrophic factor. This bio-affinitive scaffold is able to give an appropriate environment for newly born neurons. In future, we will combine these strategies to develop more effective therapies for treatment of strokes.",,T Yamashita;K Deguchi;K Sawamoto;H Okano;T Kamiya;K Abe

However, in rare cases, OSAS could be a consequence of strokes, especially if located in the brainstem. Many recent studies have found a 70 to 95% frequency of OSAS (defined by an apnoea/hypopnoea index >10) in patients with acute stroke. Age, body mass index, diabetes, and severity of stroke have been identified as independent predictors of stroke. Furthermore, the presence of OSAS in stroke patients could lead to a poor outcome. The potential mechanisms linking OSAS and stroke are probably multiple (arterial hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia, increased atherogenesis, coagulation disorders, and cerebral haemodynamic changes). Despite numerous uncertainties, OSAS should be systematically screened at the moment it is clinically suspected in patients with acute stroke.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21517643/,A pharmacoeconomic perspective on stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is predictive of higher costs for stroke care, in part due to the influence of AF on stroke severity. Costs associated with severe strokes, which are more likely in patients with AF, are about twice those of mild strokes. Thus, adequately weighing the costs associated with stroke care is important when making prevention and treatment recommendations for patients diagnosed with AF. Costs associated with AF are estimated at $6.65 billion annually, which breaks down to 44% for hospitalizations, 29% for the incremental inpatient costs of AF as a comorbid diagnosis, 23% for outpatient treatment of AF, and 4% for medications. A diagnosis of AF should be followed by careful consideration of the treatment plan. Clinicians who tend to underuse warfarin should consider whether the patient has valid contraindications to warfarin or if the risk of stroke would be unacceptably high using the alternative--low-dose aspirin. Optimal use of anticoagulation in patients with AF is projected to result in substantial savings in direct costs. Optimization of anticoagulation therapy in only half of the suboptimally anticoagulated patients with AF would save approximately $1.3 billion annually. New and emerging oral alternatives to warfarin promise to combine the advantages of oral dosing and effective anticoagulation with improvements in safety, leading to reduced monitoring and dose adjustment. As these agents become available, treatment decisions will likely incorporate economic considerations, such as the costs of medication, patient monitoring, and treatment of bleeding events.",,A Mark Fendrick

In another experimental group, rCBF was measured 1h post-insult with the iodo[14C]antipyrine method. Animals with selective MCA occlusion showed less reduction of ptiO2 and rCBF and smaller infarcts when compared with animals with combined occlusion of the MCA, CCA and PCOM. Both groups, selective MCA occlusion and combined occlusion of the MCA, CCA and PCOM, demonstrated a high reproducibility and low variability of stroke size. Relative growth of stroke size within 24 h was higher in animals with selective MCA occlusion.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11822538/,Challenges for the prevention of primary and secondary stroke: the importance of lowering blood pressure and total cardiovascular risk,"It is well established that blood pressure lowering is effective for the primary prevention of stroke and other cardiovascular disorders in subjects with blood pressures as low as 140/90 mmHg, and up to 80 years of age. Despite this knowledge, blood pressure levels are controlled in less than 25% of the hypertensive population worldwide. It has taken longer to prove that blood pressure lowering is equally effective for the prevention of recurrent stroke. The results of PROGRESS (Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study) have confirmed that a perindopril-based regimen in subjects with cerebrovascular disease substantially reduces the incidence of secondary stroke and primary myocardial infarction. It is daunting to recall that it has taken almost two decades for beta-blockers to be widely used for the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction, since widespread use of the PROGRESS regimen would prevent more than half a million strokes worldwide each year. The real challenge now is to implement novel and effective strategies for the control of blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors worldwide. Strategies should include lifestyle measures, such as stopping smoking, exercise and reducing overweight. There is a real need to identify hypertensive subjects and treat them with blood pressure lowering drugs for primary prevention. In subjects with established cardiovascular disease, consideration should be given to a range of proven interventions for secondary prevention, such as blood pressure lowering, irrespective of current blood pressure, anti-platelet drugs, statins for lowering cholesterol and glycaemic control in diabetics. Among new strategies to lower overall cardiovascular risk, consideration should be given to the development of single-pill combinations of drugs of known efficacy, including various combinations of ACE inhibitors, diuretics, beta-blockers, aspirin and statins, among others.",,J Chalmers;N Chapman

After right hemisphere damage visual and tactile extinction were equally common. However, after left hemisphere damage tactile extinction was more common than visual. The frequency of extinction was significantly higher in patients with right compared to left hemisphere damage in both visual and tactile modalities but this held only for strokes affecting the MCA and PCA territories and not for strokes affecting other vascular territories. Furthermore, the severity of extinction did not differ as a function of either the stimulus modality (visual versus tactile), the affected hemisphere (left versus right) or the stroke territory (MCA, PCA or other vascular territories). We conclude that the frequency but not severity of extinction in both modalities relates to the side of damage (i.e. left versus right hemisphere) and the vascular territories affected by the stroke, and that left hemisphere dominance for motor control may link to the greater incidence of tactile than visual extinction after left hemisphere stroke. We discuss the implications of our findings for understanding hemispheric lateralization within visuospatial attention networks.",MCA; PCA; Stroke; Tactile extinction; Visual extinction.,Magdalena Chechlacz;Pia Rotshtein;Nele Demeyere;Wai-Ling Bickerton;Glyn W Humphreys

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21556680/,Treatment of acute ischemic stroke: beyond thrombolysis and supportive care,"The initial therapeutic approach to acute ischemic stroke consists of thrombolytic therapy and early initiation of supportive care, usually commenced prior to the determination of the underlying stroke etiology. Varying stroke mechanisms may call for specific, etiology-based treatment. The majority of strokes result from cardioembolism, large-vessel atherothromboembolism, and small-vessel occlusive disease. There are scant data to support the use of acute anticoagulation therapy over anti-platelet therapy in cardioembolic stroke and large-vessel atherosclerosis, although it may be reasonable in a certain subset of patients. However, augmentation of blood flow with early surgery, stenting, or induced hypertension, may play a role in patients with large artery stenosis. The less commonly identified stroke mechanisms may warrant special consideration in treatment. Controversy remains regarding the optimal anti-thrombotic treatment of arterial dissection. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome may benefit from therapy with calcium channel blockers, high-dose steroids, or magnesium, although spontaneous recovery may occur. Inflammatory vasculopathies, such as isolated angiitis of the central nervous system and temporal arteritis, require prompt diagnosis as the mainstay of therapy is immunosuppression. Cerebral venous thrombosis is a rare cause of stroke, but one that needs early identification and treatment with anticoagulation. Rapid determination of stroke mechanism is essential for making these critical early treatment decisions.",,Neelofer Shafi;Scott E Kasner
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24417214/,Potential serum biomarkers in the pathophysiological processes of stroke,"Stroke is a leading cause of death and serious long-term disability. Ischemic stroke is the major subtype of stroke. Currently, its diagnosis is mainly dependent upon clinical symptoms and neuroimaging techniques. Despite these clinical and imaging modalities, often strokes are not recognized after initial onset. As early intervention of medical or surgical therapy is often associated with improved outcomes, there is an urgent need to improve the speed and accuracy of stroke diagnosis. Stroke is a complex pathophysiological process involving; energy failure, imbalance of ion homeostasis, acidosis, intracellular calcium overload, neuronal excitotoxicity, free radical-mediated lipid oxidation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and glial cell activation. These events ultimately lead to neuronal apoptotic cell death or necrosis. In this review, we have summarized the serum biomarkers according to the pathophysiological processes of stroke, which have been intensively studied in clinical trials of stroke over the past five years, and also used Medline's 'related article' option to identify further articles.

Both thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications are highly prevalent in chronic kidney disease patients. Growing evidence suggests that in chronic kidney disease patients, ischemic strokes are more common than hemorrhagic strokes. Chronic kidney disease is asymptomatic until an advanced stage, but mild to moderate chronic kidney disease incites various pathogenic mechanisms such as inflammation, oxidative stress, neurohormonal imbalance, formation of uremic toxins and vascular calcification which damage the endothelium and blood vessels. Cognitive dysfunction, dementia, transient infarcts, and white matter lesions are widespread in mild to moderate chronic kidney disease patients. Uremic toxins produced after chronic kidney disease can pass through the blood-brain barrier and mediate cognitive dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, chronic kidney disease precipitates vascular risk factors that can lead to atherosclerosis, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes. Chronic kidney disease also exacerbates stroke pathogenesis, worsens recovery outcomes, and limits the eligibility of stroke patients to receive available stroke therapeutics.

Participants sat restrained in a drum-like framework facing along the axis of rotation. They gave estimates of their subjective postural vertical by signalling the point of feeling upright during slow drum rotation which tilted them rightwards-leftwards. The subjective visual vertical was indicated by setting a line to upright on a computer screen. The haptic vertical was assessed in darkness by manually setting a rod to the upright. Normal estimates ranged from -2.5 degrees to 2.5 degrees for visual vertical and postural vertical, and from -4.5 degrees to 4.5 degrees for haptic vertical. Of six patients with brainstem stroke and ipsilesional lateropulsion only one had an abnormal ipsilesional postural vertical tilt (6 degrees ); six had an ipsilesional visual vertical tilt (13 +/-.4 degrees ); two had ipsilesional haptic vertical tilts of 6 degrees . In 80 patients with a hemisphere stroke (35 with contralesional lateropulsion including 6 'pushers'), 34 had an abnormal contralesional postural vertical tilt (average -8.5 +/- 4.7 degrees ), 44 had contralesional visual vertical tilts (average -7 +/- 3.2 degrees ) and 26 patients had contralesional haptic vertical tilts (-7.8 +/- 2.8 degrees ); none had ipsilesional haptic vertical or postural vertical tilts. Twenty-one (26%) showed no tilt of any modality, 41 (52%) one or two abnormal modality(ies) and 18 (22%) a transmodal contralesional tilt (i.e. PV + VV + HV). Postural vertical was more tilted in right than in left hemisphere strokes and specifically biased by damage to neural circuits centred around the primary somatosensory cortex and thalamus. This shows that thalamo-parietal projections have a functional role in the processing of the somaesthetic graviceptive information. Tilts of the postural vertical were more closely related to postural disorders than tilts of the visual vertical. All patients with a transmodal tilt showed a severe lateropulsion and 17/18 a right hemisphere stroke. This indicates that the right hemisphere plays a key role in the elaboration of an internal model of verticality, and in the control of body orientation with respect to gravity. Patients with a 'pushing' behaviour showed a transmodal tilt of verticality perception and a severe postural vertical tilt. We suggest that pushing is a postural behaviour that leads patients to align their erect posture with an erroneous reference of verticality.",,D A Pérennou;G Mazibrada;V Chauvineau;R Greenwood;J Rothwell;M A Gresty;A M Bronstein

Subgroup analyses of the stroke population found no significant differences in VLM, Digit Span, Verbal IQ or Performance IQ when left-hemisphere lesion subjects were compared to right-hemisphere lesion subjects. In contrast, early strokes were associated with significantly fewer words recalled after delay, reduced discriminability (fewer correct hits relative to false positive errors on recognition testing), and relatively worse auditory attention/working memory scores (Digit Span). These findings indicate that pediatric stroke subjects demonstrated more VLM impairment than control subjects, and early strokes were associated with greater recall and recognition deficits.

However, the stroke syndrome associated with occlusion of posterior lateral (inferolateral) thalamic perforators is less commonly known. We present an illustrative case of an inferolateral thalamic perforator stroke mimicking a middle cerebral artery (MCA) syndrome and provide a review of the literature. A 62-year-old male presented with dysarthria, contralateral hemisensory loss, and contralateral weakness, concerning for possible MCA stroke. However, close examination revealed the hemiparesis to be ataxic in nature. Imaging revealed a left PCA P2 segment occlusion and lacunar infarction of the ventral lateral (VL) and ventral posterior (VP) thalamus, the main thalamic destination of cerebellar and sensory pathways. The case is unique because the P1 segment and posterior communicating artery (Pcom) remained patent, resulting in selective occlusion of only the posterior lateral (inferolateral) thalamic perforators at the P2 level. Acute loss of the posterior lateral (inferolateral) thalamic perforators at the proximal P2 segment results in a ventral lateral and ventral posterior thalamic stroke characterized by contralateral hemisensory loss, contralateral ataxic hemiparesis, and dysarthria. It is important to recognize the inferolateral thalamic stroke syndrome, as it may be mistaken clinically for an MCA occlusion.

Although approximately 80% of strokes are due to cerebral ischemia, the mechanisms linking physical activity to the incidence of and recovery from ischemic stroke are not completely understood. This review summarizes evidence from human and animal studies regarding physical activity in the prevention of overt and covert ischemic stroke and associated injury. In cohort studies, people who are physically active have reduced rates of overt ischemic stroke and ischemic stroke mortality. However, few human studies have examined physical activity and the incidence of covert stroke. Evidence from animal models of ischemic stroke indicates that physical activity reduces injury after ischemic stroke by reducing infarct size and apoptotic cell death.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26762395/,Risk profile and treatment options of acute ischemic in-hospital stroke,"Despite the potential immediate access to diagnosis and care, in-hospital stroke (IHS) is associated with delay in diagnosis, lower rates of reperfusion treatment, and unfavorable outcome. Endovascular reperfusion therapy has shown promising results in recent trials for community-onset strokes (COS) and is limited by less contraindications than systemic thrombolysis. Thus, endovascular approaches may offer additional acute treatment options for IHS. We performed a retrospective, observational monocentric analysis of patients with acute ischemic stroke between January 2010 and December 2014. Out of 3506 acute ischemic strokes, 331 (9.4%) were IHS. In-hospital mortality (31.4 vs. 8.0%) and duration of stay after stroke (19.5 vs. 12.1 days) were higher in IHS than in COS. Most IHS occurred in cardiologic and cardiosurgical patients after catheterization or surgery. In 111 cases (33.5%) the time of onset could not be established as a result of sedation or delayed referral resulting in delayed symptom recognition. 52 IHS (15.7%) and 828 COS (26.0%, p < 0.001) patients received any kind of reperfusion therapy, of which 59.6% (IHS) and 12.1% (COS) comprised isolated endovascular interventions (p < 0.001). Intra-hospital delays (time to brain imaging, systemic thrombolysis, and angiography) were longer and outcome parameters (mRS d90, in-hospital mortality, length of stay) were worse in IHS, whereas rates of procedural complications and intracranial hemorrhages were similar in both groups. The overall rate of reperfusion treatment is lower in IHS compared to COS, as IHS patients are less likely to be eligible for systemic thrombolysis. Interventional stroke treatment is a safe and feasible therapeutic option for patients who are not eligible for systemic thrombolysis and should be anticipated whenever IHS is diagnosed.",Community-onset stroke (COS); In-hospital stroke (IHS); Neurothrombectomy; Reperfusion.,Kolja Schürmann;Omid Nikoubashman;Björn Falkenburger;Simone C Tauber;Martin Wiesmann;Jörg B Schulz;Arno Reich

We identified incident strokes in patients with SCD using ICD-9 codes for acute stroke and SCD and the California Patient Discharge Databases. We estimated SCD prevalence by using the incidence of SCD at birth with adjustment for early mortality from SCD. We identified 255 acute strokes (70 primary hemorrhagic and 185 ischemic) among 69,586 hospitalizations for SCD-related complications from 1998 to 2007. The rate of stroke in children [<18 years old (310/100,000 person-years)] was similar to young adults [18-34 years old (360/100,000 person-years)], but much higher in middle-aged [35-64 years old (1,160/100,000 person-years)] and elderly adults [> or =65 years old (4,700/100,000 person-years)]. Stroke was associated with hypertension in children and hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and renal disease in adults. Most acute strokes (75%) and in-hospital deaths from stroke (91%) occurred in adults. Our results suggest that the rate of stroke in SCD peaks in older adults and is three-fold higher than rates previously reported in African-Americans of similar age (35-64 years) without SCD. Stroke in SCD is associated with several known adult risk factors for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.

To find specific determinants of WMLs, the authors assessed 321 ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients who had undergone echocardiography. The patients with WMLs (n=160) were more often hypertensive and had a higher systolic blood pressure than the patients without WMLs. However, in a multivariate analysis, only the following variables remained associated with WMLs: (1) age: odds ratio [OR], 1.08 per year (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.11); (2) left ventricular relative wall thickness (RWT) ≥0.52: OR, 2.78 (95% CI, 1.59-4.88); (3) lacunar strokes: OR, 4.15 (95% CI, 1.83-9.44); (4) hemorrhagic strokes: OR, 5.36 (95% CI, 1.57-18.39); and (5) female: OR, 1.91 (95% CI, 1.12-3.27). Thus, the main modifiable risk factor for WMLs was RWT, which proved to be an even stronger risk factor than hypertension.

To do so, a multidomain technique is used to better explain the different aspects of the attachment to the artery wall and between the existing platelets, it being possible to obtain the mathematical equations that define the full model. For a better understanding, a consecutive approximation to the definitive model will be presented, analyzing the different problems found during the study. The final presented model considers an elastic characterization of the blood clot composition and the possibility of obtaining a consecutive detachment process from the artery wall.

Worldwide, stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death. Stroke is a major health problem; and as the population ages, its significance will grow. This paper reviews the epidemiology of stroke, the identification of modifiable risk factors, and some of the options for intervention that can reduce stroke-related mortality and morbidity. Though the diagnosis and care of stroke patients has improved, mortality resultant from stroke remains significant, with only 50% 5-year survival in some clinical studies. The risk of stroke following a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or initial stroke is also significant-approximately 30% following either event. Stroke severity at onset and patient age are the most important factors for predicting prognosis. Stroke prevention focuses on management of the traditional cardiovascular risk factors especially control of blood pressure and smoking cessation. The role of diabetes and lipid control in stroke prevention continues to be studied. The optimum use of anticoagulation to reduce stroke risk has been explored by the Stroke in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) studies. Carotid endarterectomy is effective in stroke prevention for those with symptomatic carotid obstruction of 70%, but its role in other scenarios is less certain.

Ever since the publication of the major randomized trials showing the benefit of thrombolysis in early acute stroke, there has been growing impetus for the diagnosis of acute stroke to become a medical emergency. Currently, computed tomography (CT) remains the diagnostic method of choice in the assessment of acute strokes. It is practical, rapid, and widely available and, as used in these trials, can robustly exclude acute hemorrhage before potential thrombolysis. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a number of advantages over unenhanced CT, the practicalities of performing MRI in the acute setting have hampered its widespread use. There are several reasons why speed of imaging is paramount in acute strokes. Firstly, such patients are often unwell and agitated and, as such, require close monitoring. Moreover, because of the short window within which intravenous thrombolysis can be given, time-consuming imaging studies decrease the therapeutic options available and likelihood of successful intervention.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26041479/,Timing of blood pressure lowering in acute ischemic stroke,"Whether there are any benefits without harm from early lowering of blood pressure (BP) in the setting of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) has been a longstanding controversy in medicine. Whilst most studies have consistently shown associations between elevated BP, particularly systolic BP, and poor outcome, some also report that very low BP (systolic <130 mmHg) and large reductions in systolic BP are associated with poor outcomes in AIS. However, despite these associations, the observed U- or J-shaped relationship between BP and outcome in these patients may not be causally related. Patients with more severe strokes may have a more prominent autonomic response and later lower BP as their condition worsens, often pre-terminally. Fortunately, substantial progress has been made in recent years with new evidence arising from well-conducted randomized trials. This review outlines new evidence and recommendations for clinical practice over BP management in AIS.",,Cheryl Carcel;Craig S Anderson
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16514349/,Why a polysomnogram should become part of the diagnostic evaluation of stroke and transient ischemic attack,"Neurologists need to recognize, diagnose, and treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Increasing medical evidence suggests that OSA is an independent risk factor for stroke and TIA. Stroke (or TIA) is more likely a cause, rather than a consequence, of OSA because PSG studies have shown: 1) apneas in stroke are typically obstructive, not central or Cheyne-Stokes in type; 2) apneas are just as frequent and severe in patients with either TIA or stroke; 3) OSA severity is not influenced by the acuteness or location of the stroke; 4) untreated OSA patients have more strokes, stroke morbidity, and mortality than those who are treated. OSA alone can induce hypertension, especially in younger men. A causal relationship has recently been demonstrated between OSA and hypertension. A distinctive feature of OSA-induced hypertension is loss of the normal nighttime fall in blood pressure (""nondippers""). Data from the Sleep Heart Health Study showed a dose-response association between OSA severity and the presence of hypertension 4 years later. Hypertension or ischemic heart disease usually develops in untreated patients with OSA over time without particular worsening of OSA. Studies have shown sleep itself is not a risk factor for stroke because most stroke and TIAs begin between 6 am and noon, while the individual is awake. However, OSA promptly be considered in stroke beginning during sleep because 88% of strokes that develop during sleep occur in ""nondippers."" Premature death in OSA patients is most often cardiovascular, but occurs while the patients are awake. The risk of myocardial infarction is increased 20-fold in untreated OSA. Treating OSA patients with continuous positive airway pressure can prevent or improve hypertension, reduce abnormal elevations of inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules, reduce excessive sympathetic tone, avoid increased vascular oxidative stress, reverse coagulation abnormalities, and reduce leptin levels. If all this can be achieved by a polysomnogram, then this test should become part of a neurologist's armamentarium for stroke and TIA.",,Madeleine Grigg-Damberger

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16901448/,Temporal trends in the incidence and case fatality of stroke in children and adolescents,"A recent study reported that mortality from stroke in children and adolescents decreased by 58% from 1979 to 1998, although it wasn't clear if the case fatality or the incidence of stroke in this age group is decreasing. We report trends of stroke incidence and case fatality in children and adolescents within a large biracial population. The study involved collection of all strokes in the study population between January 1, 1988 and December 31, 1989, July 1, 1993 and June 30, 1994, and January 1, 1999 and December 31, 1999, at all of the regional hospitals serving the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky population (only the children's hospital in 1988). Study nurses reviewed the medical records of all inpatients with stroke-related discharge diagnoses and abstracted relevant data. A study physician reviewed each abstract to determine whether a stroke or transient ischemic attack had occurred. A total of 54 strokes occurred in children or adolescents younger than 20 years during the three study periods (30% African American, 70% Caucasian, and 56% female). The overall incidence rate of all strokes in children younger than 15 years was 6.4/100,000 in 1999, a nonsignificant increase when compared to 1988. The 30-day case-fatality rates were 18% in 1988-1989, 9% in 1993-1994, and 9% in 1999. We found that the incidence of strokes in children has been stable over the past 10 years. The previously reported nationwide decrease in overall stroke mortality in children might be due to decreasing case fatality after stroke and not decreasing stroke incidence. Based on our data, we conservatively estimated that approximately 3000 children less than 20 years old would have a stroke in the United States in 2004.",,Dawn Kleindorfer;Jane Khoury;Brett Kissela;Kathy Alwell;Daniel Woo;Rosemary Miller;Alexander Schneider;Charles Moomaw;Joseph P Broderick

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27395459/,[Post Stroke Dementia],"Post-stroke dementia (PSD) is a clinical entity that encompasses all types of dementia following an index stroke. Current evidence suggests that 25-30% of ischemic stroke survivors develop immediate or delayed vascular cognitive impairment or vascular dementia. The type of stroke can be either ischemic, hemorrhagic or hypoperfusive. There are multiple risk factors for PSD including older age, family history, genetic variants, low educational status, vascular comorbidities, prior transient ischemic attack or recurrent stroke and depressive illness. Pre-stroke dementia refers to the occurrence of cognitive impairment before the index stroke, which may be caused by a vascular burden as well as insidious neurodegenerative changes. Neuroimaging determinants of dementia after stroke include silent brain infarcts, white matter changes, lacunar infarcts and medial temporal lobe atrophy. Published clinical trials have not been promising and there is little information on whether PSD can be prevented using pharmacological agents. Control of vascular disease risk and prevention of recurrent strokes are key to reducing the burden of cognitive decline and post-stroke dementia. Modern imaging and analysis techniques will help to elucidate the mechanism of PSD and establish better treatment.",,Masafumi Ihara

Ischemic strokes account for 87 percent of total stroke cases, yet the only FDA-approved treatments involve disruption of the blood clot to restore blood flow. New treatments aimed at saving or protecting neural tissue have largely failed in clinical trials and so new methodology or targets must be found. The occurrence of strokes significantly increases between 6 AM and 12 PM, implicating the circadian system in the onset of this debilitating brain injury. But it is not known whether or how the circadian system may regulate the response to and recovery from stroke. New strategies to identify treatments for stroke are beginning to look at cell types other than neurons as therapeutic targets, including astrocytes. In this review, we present links between the astrocyte circadian clock, the molecular response to stroke, and the damage caused by ischemia.

Three additional mutations in CD59, leading to loss of function, have been described, and overall, 12/12 (100%) of patients with any mutation presented with neurological symptoms; 11/12 (92%) patients presented with recurrent peripheral neuropathy, 6/12 (50%) with recurrent strokes, and 1/12 (8%) with retinal involvement. We review the possible thrombophilic profile associated with the mutations. In these patients, excessive intravascular hemolysis saturates scavenger mechanisms resulting in free hemoglobin in plasma that irreversibly reacts with nitric oxide to form nitrate and methemoglobin, leading to arterial thrombosis. CD59 loss of function is also one of the major thrombophilic mechanisms in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. We then describe the relationship with demyelination. The lack of CD59 allows uncontrolled complement amplification following low-level spontaneous-, viral-, or post viral-induced complement activation, resulting in severe demyelination in the peripheral nervous system. It is interesting, and certainly encouraging, that after 3 years, following 4 patients with Cys89Tyr mutations who are treated with eculizumab, no strokes occurred and non-permanent neurological insults underwent resolution without any new neurological exacerbations.",CD59; Demyelination; Guillain-Barre syndrome; Stroke; Thrombophilia.,Adi Tabib;Netanel Karbian;Dror Mevorach

The incidence of post-stroke hemichorea was 0.54 % (27 out of 5,009 patients). The lesions were located in the caudate and putamen (n = 6), cortex (n = 6), thalamus and subthalamic area (n = 4), subthalamus (n = 4), putamen (n = 3), caudate (n = 2), and the globus pallidus (n = 2). Over the mean follow-up period of 22 months, the hemichorea disappeared in 56% of the patients, while it persisted in others. The rate of disappearance of hemichorea was significantly higher in patients with cortical strokes than in those with subthalamic lesions (P < 0.05). We conclude that hemichorea is a rare manifestation of stroke and most often produced by lenticular lesions followed by subthalamic and cortical lesions.

We sought to determine whether more fragmented ambulatory care is associated with an increase in the hazard of incident stroke, overall and stratified by health status and by race. Methods and Results We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the REGARDS (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) study (2003-2016), including participants aged ≥65 years who had linked Medicare fee-for-service claims and no history of stroke (N=12 510). We measured fragmentation of care with the reversed Bice-Boxerman index. We used Poisson models to determine the association between fragmentation and adjudicated incident stroke. The average age of participants was 70.5 years; 53% were women, 32% were Black participants, and 16% were participants with fair or poor health. Overall, the adjusted rate of incident stroke was similar for high versus low fragmentation (8.2 versus 8.1 per 1000 person-years, respectively; P=0.89). Among participants with fair or poor self-rated health, having high versus low fragmentation was associated with a trend toward a higher adjusted rate of incident strokes (14.8 versus 10.4 per 1000 person-years, respectively; P=0.067). Among Black participants with fair or poor self-rated health, having high versus low fragmentation was associated with a higher adjusted rate of strokes (19.3 versus 10.3 per 1000 person-years, respectively; P=0.02).

However, the association between stroke occurrence and carbon monoxide poisoning remains unclear. This nationwide study in Korea analyzed the incidence of stroke in survivors of CO poisoning. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this nationwide, population-based longitudinal study, the database of the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service was searched to identify patients diagnosed with CO poisoning from 2012 to 2018. Their incidence of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, the patterns of stroke incidences, the annual incidence rates in sequential time, the standardized incidence ratio (SIR), and the effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) were analyzed. RESULTS Of the 29 301 patients diagnosed with CO poisoning during the study period, 984 (3.36%) were diagnosed with stroke after CO poisoning, with approximately 50% occurring within 1 year after CO poisoning. The overall SIR for stroke was 19.49 (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.92-21.12) during the first year, decreasing to 5.64 (95% CI, 4.75-6.66) during the second year. Overall stroke hazard ratio (HR) in the patients admitted to the ICU for CO poisoning was 2.28 (95% CI, 1.19-2.27), compared with 2.35 (95% CI, 1.94-2.84) for ischemic stroke and 1.76 (95% CI, 1.11-2.78) for hemorrhagic stroke. Cumulative HRs did not differ between patients who were and were not treated with HBOT for stroke. CONCLUSIONS CO poisoning is a high-risk factor for the development of stroke, evidenced by high incidences of stroke after CO poisoning. Practical strategies for preventing stroke after CO poisoning are needed, because stroke after CO poisoning affects adults of almost all ages, significantly increasing their socioeconomic burden.",,Hyuk-Hoon Kim;Sangchun Choi;Yoon Seok Jung;Young-Gi Min;Dukyong Yoon;Sung Eun Lee

About 87% of strokes are ischemic in origin and occur in the territory of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Currently the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for the treatment of this devastating disease is tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). However, tPA has a small therapeutic window for administration (3 - 6 hr), and is only effective in 4% of the patients who actually receive it. Current research focuses on understanding the pathophysiology of stroke in order to find potential therapeutic targets. Thus, reliable models are crucial, and the MCA occlusion (MCAo) model (also termed the intraluminal filament or suture model) is deemed to be the most clinically relevant surgical model of ischemic stroke, and is fairly non-invasive and easily reproducible.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10718096/,HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in the prevention of stroke,"Stroke is a heterogeneous disorder, with the definition including both haemorrhagic and ischaemic stroke. Although these subtypes of stroke have different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, atherosclerosis plays a pivotal role in both. Most risk factors for cardiovascular disease are also risk factors for stroke. Patients with a history of cardiovascular events are at an increased risk of stroke. Although hypercholesterolaemia is the most characteristic risk factor for atherosclerotic diseases, recent data suggest that the correlation between cholesterol levels and either ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke is weak. However, the interpretation of these results is hampered by the inconsistent use of classifications of the various subtypes of stroke in studies. Pooled data on the effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors show a 30% risk reduction in strokes. These beneficial effects are obtained from studies in middle aged patients with ischaemic heart disease, the interpretation being that the effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on stroke are mediated via (i) cholesterol-lowering effects on the coronary vasculature or (ii) cholesterol-independent effects of these agents. The results cannot be extrapolated to the elderly, among whom stroke most frequently occurs.",,A H van Mil;R G Westendorp;E L Bollen;A M Lagaay;G J Blauw

Various myths embellish his various biographies. This is also true for his pathography: several articles written by authors from various specialties suggested him having suffered from psychiatric diseases, like cyclothymia or mania, and rheumatologic disorders, like arthritis, while others tended to interpret his recurrent palsies as typical sequelae of ischemic strokes. More recently, reports proposing lead poisoning as the main source of disease in Händel gained the attention of musical and lay press. During his last years of life, Händel was struck with blindness, which in his era had been interpreted as being due to cataracts. This led to three ""coucher"" operations, all of them without any lasting effect. Although a definite diagnosis cannot be proven from the original sources, the most plausible explanation for Händel's palsies and visual impairment may be based on one single context, i.e., cerebrovascular disease.

The aim of this study was to investigate this association in a large general population cohort. Methods- We used the French population-based cohort, CONSTANCES (Cohorte des Consultants des Centres d'Examens de Santé), to retrieve information on age, sex, smoking, and working hours from the baseline, self-administered questionnaire. Other cardiovascular risk factors and previous occurrence of stroke were taken from a parallel medical interview. We defined LWH as working time >10 hours daily for at least 50 days per year. Participants with primarily part-time jobs were excluded as were those with stroke before LWH exposure. We used logistic models to estimate the association between LWH and stroke, stratified by age, sex, and occupation. In additional modeling, we excluded subjects whose stroke occurred within 5 years of the first reported work exposure. Results- Among the 143 592 participants in the analyses, there were 1224 (0.9%) strokes, 42 542 (29.6%) reported LWH, and 14 481 (10.1%) reported LWH for 10 years or more. LWH was associated with an increased risk of stroke: adjusted odds ratio of 1.29 (95% CI, 1.11-1.49). Being exposed to LWH for 10 years or more was more strongly associated with stroke, adjusted odds ratio of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.21-1.74). The association showed no differences between men and women but was stronger in white-collar workers under 50 years of age. Conclusions- This large analysis reveals a significant association between stroke and exposure to LWH for 10 years or more.

There were examined patients consequently in definite time points after ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes: at hospital stay (234 patients), in 1 month (203 patients) and in 3 months (176 patients). Global PSF and certain PSF domains were measured by multidimensional fatigue inventory-20 (MFI-20) scale. In multivariate logistic regression analysis the majority of variables (gender, marital status, education level, smoking status, level of alcohol consumption, apathetic impairments, arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, waist circumference) were not significantly associated with any PSF domain risk at any time point after stroke. On the other hand, it had been found reliable associations between risk of global PSF and employing status before stroke, pre-stroke fatigue, anxiety symptoms, excessive daytime sleepiness, pain. Majority of risk factors for specific PSF domains (physical, mental, activity-related, motivational) are the same as for global PSF. The exception is mild cognitive impairments for mental PSF and depression signs for motivational PSF.

Neurological manifestations usually occur in 3 phases: (1) prodromal symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, and vertigo, (2) recurrent strokes, and (3) early onset dementia. Livedo racemosa precedes the onset of recurrent strokes by more than 10 years, but in many instances, the significance of the skin lesion is recognized only after the appearance of the stroke. The involvement of the heart valves, systolic labile hypertension, and retinal changes are also commonly associated with this syndrome. Treatment of SS is primarily based on anecdotal reports. Antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents are used for secondary stroke prophylaxis, and a recent study showed a relatively lower stroke recurrence rate with the universal use of antiplatelet/antithrombotic agents. Routine use of anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive therapies is controversial. Neuropsychiatric prognosis of SS is relatively poor with predominant deficits in the concentration, attention, visual perception, and visuospatial skills.",Sneddon syndrome; antiphospholipid antibodies; dementia; ischemic strokes; livedo racemosa; thrombophilia.,Debopam Samanta;Sarah Cobb;Kapil Arya

Apart from risk containment, efforts to prevent or treat CSVD are ineffective due to the unknown pathogenesis of the disease. CSVD, a subtype of stroke, is characterized by recurrent strokes and neurodegeneration. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment, chronic inflammatory responses, and leukocyte infiltration are classical pathological features of CSVD. Understanding how BBB disruption instigates inflammatory and degenerative processes may be informative for CSVD therapy. Antigens derived from the brain are found in the peripheral blood of lacunar stroke patients, and antibodies and sensitized T cells against brain antigens are also detected in patients with leukoaraiosis. These findings suggest that antigen-specific immune responses could occur in CSVD. This review describes the neurovascular unit features of CSVD, the immune responses to specific neuronal and glial processes that may be involved in a distinct mechanism of CSVD, and the current evidence of the association between mechanisms of inflammation and interventions in CSVD. We suggest that autoimmune activity should be assessed in future studies; this knowledge would benefit the development of effective therapeutic interventions in CSVD.",autoimmune response; cerebral small vessel disease; degeneration; inflammation; pathogenesis.,Ying Fu;Yaping Yan

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10565968/,Neuroprotection in acute ischaemic stroke. Current status and future potential,"Acute ischaemic strokes can potentially be treated by 2 different mechanisms: lysing the thrombus to enhance brain perfusion or salvaging brain tissue directly. Neuroprotective agents are designed to try to salvage brain tissue. They work either during acute ischaemia or during reperfusion, when additional brain injury may occur. Despite the completion of a number of clinical trials investigating neuroprotective agents that have various mechanisms of action, as yet no effective agent has been identified. Some drugs, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists and anti-leucocyte adhesion agents, have been limited by adverse effects and drug reactions. However, the development of other agents in these classes that have better risk to benefit ratios may lead to an effective neuroprotective drug. Other drugs, including citicoline, clomethiazole and nalmefene, have more efficacy in certain patient subgroups than in the stroke population as a whole. Therefore, targeting these agents toward the groups in which they are most likely to work, such as patients with a certain size of stroke, may uncover efficacy. Encouragingly, a number of drugs that are in the early stages of development, such as YM 872, Bay X 3702 and BMS 204352, appear to offer new hope for neuroprotection.",,H L Lutsep;W M Clark

If left undiagnosed and untreated, patients with ET carry an increased risk of recurrent thrombosis involving major organs including the brain. We report an interesting case of a 67-year-old man, who was successfully thrombolysed for AIS resulting from ET. He presented with sudden onset of left-sided hemiparesis with a left-ventricular clot. His subsequent investigations including positive JAK2 V617F mutation confirmed the diagnosis of ET. He made a significant recovery with thrombolysis, anticoagulation, antiplatelet and hydroxyurea. A fear of post-thrombolytic haemorrhagic complications appears the major reason for the lack of reports of thrombolysis in ET-related AIS. Although the diagnosis of ET was confirmed on subsequent investigations, successful thrombolysis in our case provides preliminary evidence that ET-related AIS cases can undergo successful thrombolysis using tenecteplase.

Thus, a specific plan was created in the area of Bergamo in Northern Italy to increase the number of procedures. The plan, started in 2010, consisted of: (1) subdivision of the area of Bergamo into three zones, each one served by a single Stroke-Unit (SU) licensed to thrombolysis; (2) information to population via newspapers and local broadcasting; and (3) teachings both to personnel of Emergency Medical Service and General Practitioners. Here, we have compared the results of the SU of Policlinico San Marco in the years 2008-2009 versus those in the years 2010-2011. During 2008 and 2009, SU admitted 376 acute ischemic strokes, 60 of whom (16 %) within 3 h of the event. Of those patients, 8 (2 %) were treated with thrombolysis. At 3 months of stroke, 61 patients (16 %) were alive and self-independent. During 2010 and 2011, SU admitted 401 acute ischemic strokes, 91 of whom (22 %) within 3 h of stroke. Of those patients, 23 (6 %) were treated with thrombolysis. At 3 months of stroke, 100 patients were alive and self-independent (25 %). The increases of thrombolytic procedures (p = 0.0171), of self-independent patients (p = 0.0036), and of patients arriving within 3 h of stroke (p = 0.0226) were statistically significant.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30628661/,"Cancer-associated stroke: Pathophysiology, detection and management (Review)","Numerous types of cancer have been shown to be associated with either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. In this review, the epidemiology and pathophysiology of stroke in cancer patients is discussed, while providing vital information on the diagnosis and management of patients with cancer and stroke. Cancer may mediate stroke pathophysiology either directly or via coagulation disorders that establish a state of hypercoagulation, as well as via infections. Cancer treatment options, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery have all been shown to aggravate the risk of stroke as well. The clinical manifestation varies greatly depending upon the underlying cause; however, in general, cancer‑associated strokes tend to appear as multifocal in neuroimaging. Furthermore, several serum markers have been identified, such as high D‑Dimer levels and fibrin degradation products. Managing cancer patients with stroke is a delicate matter. The cancer should not be considered a contraindication in applying thrombolysis and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) administration, since the risk of hemorrhage in cancer patients has not been reported to be higher than that in the general population. Anticoagulation, on the contrary, should be carefully examined. Clinicians should weigh the benefits and risks of anticoagulation treatment for each patient individually; the new oral anticoagulants appear promising; however, low‑molecular‑weight heparin remains the first choice. On the whole, stroke is a serious and not a rare complication of malignancy.

We investigated the association of orthostatic blood pressure change (within 2 minutes after supine to standing) obtained at baseline (1987 to 1989) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study with incidence of ischemic stroke subtypes through 2007. Among 12 817 black and white individuals without a history of stroke at baseline, 680 ischemic strokes (153 lacunar, 383 nonlacunar thrombotic, and 144 cardioembolic strokes) occurred during a median follow-up of 18.7 years. There was a U-shaped association between orthostatic systolic blood pressure change and lacunar stroke incidence (quadratic P=0.004). In contrast, orthostatic systolic blood pressure decrease of 20 mm Hg or more was associated with increased occurrence of nonlacunar thrombotic and cardioembolic strokes independent of sitting systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication use, diabetes, and other lifestyle, physiological, biochemical, and medical conditions at baseline (for nonlacunar thrombotic: hazard ratio, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.43 to 2.84; for cardioembolic: hazard ratio, 1.85, 95% CI, 1.01 to 3.39). Orthostatic diastolic blood pressure decrease was associated with increased risk of nonlacunar thrombotic and cardioembolic strokes; the hazard ratios (95% CI) associated with 10 mm Hg lower orthostatic diastolic blood pressure (continuous) were 1.26 (1.06 to 1.50) and 1.41 (1.06 to 1.88), respectively, in fully adjusted models. In conclusion, the present study found that nonlacunar ischemic stroke incidence was positively associated with an orthostatic decrease of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, whereas greater lacunar stroke incidence was associated with both orthostatic increases and decreases in systolic blood pressure.",,Hiroshi Yatsuya;Aaron R Folsom;Alvaro Alonso;Rebecca F Gottesman;Kathryn M Rose;ARIC Study Investigators

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17313125/,Time is brain!,"Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a proven treatment in the prevention of stroke, but its overall effectiveness is reduced by excessive delays from symptom to surgery. Specifically, delaying surgery in symptomatic patients with 50-99% NASCET stenoses (70-99% ECST) for >12 weeks prevents only eight strokes per 1000 CEAs in the long term. This is a very depressing observation as the 2004 Sentinel Audit observed that only 50% of stroke patients in the UK will have undergone a Duplex scan by 12 weeks. Excessive delays prior to surgery not only undermine professional confidence in the role of CEA, but they effectively mean that while every patient is exposed to the risks of surgery, many may gain little in the way of long-term stroke prevention.

Contrary to the long-held dogma, neurogenesis occurs in discrete areas of the adult brain, the hippocampus and the subventricular zone, and NSCs reside in the adult central nervous system. Recent studies have shown that neurogenesis is increased in the diseased brains, after strokes and traumatic brain injuries, and that new neuronal cells are generated at the sites of injury, where they replace some of the degenerated nerve cells. Thus, the central nervous system has the capacity to regenerate after injury. The contribution and function of the increased neurogenesis in the pathologies of the nervous system remain to be understood. The increased hippocampal neurogenesis may play a role in neuroadaptation, such as in memory troubles and depression, associated with these pathologies. The increased neurogenesis at the sites of injury may represent an attempt by the central nervous system to regenerate itself after injury. Newly generated neuronal cells at the sites of injury originate from the subventricular zone.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14719173/,Arterial ischemic strokes in infants and children: an overview of current approaches,"Stroke in children is increasingly recognized. The incidence exceeds 8 per 100,000 per year. Important differences in stroke in newborns and children compared with adults, as well as a paucity of clinical trials, create challenges in the diagnosis and management of pediatric arterial ischemic stroke (AIS). The neurological presentation of AIS can be subtle. Radiographic diagnosis of acute AIS is also challenging because CT scan may be normal early on. Risk factors include vascular, intravascular, and embolic disorders; frequently, there are multiple risk factors in a given child, necessitating thorough investigations. More than 50% have a vasculopathy including postvaricella angiopathy, dissection, moyamoya, or vasculitis. Intravascular mechanisms are frequently present, including dehydration. Hematological or prothrombotic conditions are also associated with AIS in children, and include sickle cell disease and prothrombotic disorders. The latter have been identified in from one third to one half of children with AIS, are usually acquired, and frequently act in concert with other risk factors for stroke. The most common embolic source is congenital heart disease, which is present in 25% of children with AIS. Outcomes include death in 6% and neurological deficits in two thirds of children. Given that no clinical trials have been completed in pediatric stroke to date, treatment is empiric. Initial neuroprotective strategies aim to reduce the size of the infarct. For older children antithrombotic agents (antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants) are given to reduce the 20 to 30% risk of recurrence. There are coordinated research efforts currently being initiated, which over the next decade will result in clinical trials in this understudied condition.",,Gabrielle deVeber

Stroke is classified as ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, or hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. Because 87 % of strokes are classified as ischemic, this type will be the predominant focus of this review. Except for thrombolytic therapy, there is no established treatment to reduce the neurological deficits caused by ischemic stroke. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new therapeutic strategies designed to improve neurological functions after ischemic stroke. Recently, therapies to enhance neurogenesis after ischemic stroke have been investigated. However, these approaches have not led to successful clinical outcomes. This review addresses the pathophysiology of stroke, neurogenesis after stroke, and how to stimulate these processes based on the current literature.

In total, 62 acute stroke patients and 16 age- and gender-matched hospitalised controls underwent polysomnographic studies. Sleep architecture was analysed according to the topography of lesion, severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) and outcome (Barthel Index) of stroke. We found that sleep architecture is disturbed in stroke patients, regardless of SDB. Stroke patients (without SDB) have reductions in total sleep time and sleep efficiency, reduced stage II and slow wave sleep, increased wakefulness during sleep and increased sleep latency. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is reduced when SDB is also present. REM sleep is relatively preserved in cerebellar strokes, as opposed to other topographies. Sleep stages I and REM are negatively associated with stroke severity, and the latency to REM sleep is positively correlated with a good outcome. Sleep architecture is impaired in stroke patients (with fragmentation, increased wakefulness and reduced slow wave sleep), and this correlates with severity and outcome. Sleep disturbances should be investigated and addressed in these patients.

They represent 20% of all ischemic strokes. The chronobiological pattern of ischemic stroke onset, with higher frequency in the first morning hours, is likely to be associated with circadian fluctuations in blood pressure, heart rate, hemostatic processes, and the occurrence of atrial fibrillation episodes. The modulation of stroke onset time also involves the sleep-wake cycle as there is an increased risk associated with rapid-eye-movement sleep. Furthermore, sleep may have an impact on the expression and perception of stroke symptoms by patients, but also on brain tissue ischemia processes via a neuroprotective effect. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is particularly prevalent in WUS patients. Until recently, WUS was considered as a contra-indication to reperfusion therapy because of the unknown onset time and the potential cerebral bleeding risk associated with thrombolytic treatment. A renewed interest in WUS has been observed over the past few years related to an improved radiological evaluation of WUS patients and the recent demonstration of the clinical efficacy of reperfusion in selected patients when the presence of salvageable brain tissue on advanced cerebral imaging is demonstrated.",Circadian rhythm; Mechanical thrombectomy; Obstructive sleep apnea; REM sleep; Sleep; Thrombolysis; Wake-up stroke.,Laure Peter-Derex;Laurent Derex

Following application of the clinical pathway, there was a significant improvement in all the clinical indicators that were felt to require further attention and none had a setback. The length of hospital stay was decreased, and there was no significant increase in the hospital costs in the post-pathway study despite an increase in the number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed.

Post-stroke prognosis is associated with autonomic status. Recently, studies showed that heart rate variability (HRV) is an early outcome predictor in acute stroke patients. The purpose of our study was to investigate association decreased HRV by fractal dimension (FD) with early END within 72 h of admission and 1-year RIS. In this study, we assessed autonomic function of ischemic stroke patients within 24 h from symptom onset by FD. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was utilized to determine the optimal cut point of FD for END and RIS. 516 patients (mean age 66.14 ± 10.11) with acute ischemic stroke underwent a comprehensive clinical investigation and FD test. According to the data of FD, we investigated association with END within 72 h of admission and the 1-year RIS. ROC curve analysis shown that the optimal cut point of FD for END and RIS were FD ≤ 1.05 and FD ≤ 1.15 respectively. In fully adjusted models, there was an association between FD ≤ 1.05 and END (adjusted odds ratio, 2.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.55-4.49; P < 0.001), there was an association between FD ≤ 1.15 and RIS (adjusted odds ratio,5.40; 95% confidence interval, 3.02-9.64; P < .001). These findings indicate that FD ≤ 1.05 and FD ≤ 1.15 were independently associated with increased risk of END and RIS respectively, which may have predictive value in END and RIS.",Acute ischemic stroke; Early neurological deterioration; Fractal dimension; Heart rate variability; Recurrent ischemic stroke.,Lanying He;Jian Wang;Lili Zhang;Xiaoqiang Zhang;Weiwei Dong;Hao Yang

The objective of this study was to assess how comorbidity and serum albumin levels relate to rehabilitation outcome in geriatric stroke patients. Another aim was to assess whether stroke etiology (ischemic or hemorrhagic) influences these links. Medical records of 80 patients (68 ischemic and 12 hemorrhagic strokes) older than 65 years, who had suffered their first stroke, were investigated. Functional performance levels at admission and discharge were evaluated using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Length of stay in hospital was recorded. Serum albumin levels and comorbidity scores on admission were noted. Correlations between these variables and differences between the groups categorized according to stroke etiology were analyzed. In the group of geriatric stroke patients as a whole, serum albumin level was correlated with FIM score at admission and discharge. Comorbidity score was negatively correlated with length of stay. In the ischemic stroke subgroup, serum albumin level was positively correlated with length of stay and with functional gain, and comorbidity score was negatively correlated with functional gain. Analysis of the data for the hemorrhagic stroke subgroup revealed none of these correlations. It was concluded that serum albumin level and comorbidity are useful indices in geriatric ischemic stroke patients for predicting functional outcome and time spent in rehabilitation.",,Nur Turhan;Nur Saraçgil;Pnar Oztop;Meral Bayramoğlu

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30917754/,Brief Educational Intervention Improves Emergency Medical Services Stroke Recognition,"Background and Purpose- Recognition of stroke symptoms and hospital prenotification by emergency medical services (EMS) facilitate rapid stroke treatment; however, one-third of patients with stroke are unrecognized by EMS. To promote stroke recognition and quality measure compliant prehospital stroke care, we deployed a 30-minute online EMS educational module coupled with a performance feedback system in a single Michigan county. Methods- During a 24-month study period, a registry of consecutive EMS-transported suspected or unrecognized stroke cases was utilized to perform an interrupted time series analysis of the impact of the EMS education and feedback intervention. For each agency, we compared EMS stroke recognition and quality measure compliance rates, as well as emergency department performance and hospital outcomes during 12 preintervention months with performance in the remaining study months. Results- A total of 1805 EMS-transported cases met inclusion criteria; 1235 (68.4%) of these had ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes or transient ischemic attacks. There were no trends toward improvement in any outcome before the intervention. After the intervention, the EMS stroke recognition rate increased from 63.8% to 69.5% ( P=0.037). Prenotification increased from 60.9% to 77.3% ( P<0.001). Among patients with ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack, there was a trend toward higher rates of tPA (tissue-type plasminogen activator) delivery (13.9%-17.7%; P=0.096) and a significant increase in tPA delivery within 45 minutes (5.7%-8.9%; P=0.042) after intervention. However, improvements in EMS recognition were limited to the first 3 months following intervention. Conclusions- A brief educational intervention was associated with improved EMS stroke recognition, hospital prenotification, and faster tPA delivery.

In the 6 weeks following the September 2010 earthquake there were 97 acute stroke admissions, with 79 (81.4%) ischaemic infarctions. This was similar to the 2009 control period which had 104 acute stroke admissions, of whom 80 (76.9%) had ischaemic infarction. In the 6 weeks following the February 2011 earthquake, there were 71 stroke admissions, and 61 (79.2%) were ischaemic infarction. This was less than the 96 strokes (72 [75%] ischaemic infarction) in the corresponding control period. None of the comparisons were statistically significant. There was also no difference in the rate of cardioembolic infarction from atrial fibrillation between the study periods. Patients admitted during the February 2011 earthquake period were less likely to be discharged directly home when compared to the control period (31.2% versus 46.9%, p=0.036). There was no observable trend in the number of weekly stroke admissions between the 2 weeks leading to and 6 weeks following the earthquakes. Our results suggest that severe psychological stress from earthquakes did not influence the subsequent short term risk of acute stroke, but the severity of the earthquake in February 2011 and associated civil structural damages may have influenced the pattern of discharge for stroke patients.",Earthquake; Psychological stress; Stroke; Stroke trigger.,Teddy Y Wu;Jeanette Cheung;David Cole;John N Fink

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33797954/,Thalamic Nuclei and Thalamocortical Pathways After Left Hemispheric Stroke and Their Association with Picture Naming,"Background: Previous studies utilized lesion-centric approaches to study the role of the thalamus in language. In this study, we tested the hypotheses that non-lesioned dorsomedial and ventral anterior nuclei (DMVAC) and pulvinar lateral posterior nuclei complexes (PLC) of the thalamus and their projections to the left hemisphere show secondary effects of the strokes, and that their microstructural integrity is closely related to language-related functions. Methods: Subjects with language impairments after a left-hemispheric cortical and/or subcortical, early stroke (n = 31, ≤6 months) or late stroke (n = 30, ≥12 months) sparing thalamus underwent the Boston Naming Test (BNT) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The tissue integrity of DMVAC, PLC, and their cortical projections was quantified with DTI. The right-left asymmetry profiles of these structures were evaluated in relation to the time since stroke. The association between microstructural integrity and BNT score was investigated in relation to stroke chronicity with partial correlation analyses adjusted for confounds. Results: In both early stroke and late stroke groups, left-sided tracts showed significantly higher mean diffusivities (MDs), which were likely due to Wallerian degeneration. Higher MD values of the cortical projections from the left PLC (r = -0.5, p = 0.005) and DMVAC (r = -0.53, p = 0.002) were correlated with lower BNT score in the late stroke but not early stroke group. Conclusion: Nonlesioned thalamic nuclei and thalamocortical pathways show rightward lateralization of the microstructural integrity after a left hemispheric stroke, and this pattern is associated with poorer naming. Impact statement To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first diffusion tensor imaging study suggesting that the thalamic nuclei and pathways of the left hemisphere spared by direct ischemic insult undergo secondary degeneration over time that is associated with poorer picture naming. Our study may pave the way for targeted interventions such as invasive or noninvasive brain stimulation techniques that engage these spared pathways to prevent secondary degeneration and lead to better outcomes in poststroke aphasia.",aphasia; diffusion tensor imaging; naming; stroke; thalamus.,Zafer Keser;Erin L Meier;Melissa D Stockbridge;Bonnie L Breining;Rajani Sebastian;Argye E Hillis

We estimated changes in stroke incidence, the case-fatality rate, risk factors, and the use of primary prevention, based on a continuous registry of a well-defined population, from 1985 to 2004. We recorded 3142 ischemic strokes, 341 primary cerebral hemorrhages and 74 subarachnoid hemorrhages. During the 20-year study period, age at first stroke increased by 5 years in men and 8 years in women. Comparing the periods 1985-1989 and 2000-2004, the age - and sex-adjusted incidence rates of first-ever strokes were stable, except for lacunar strokes, the incidence of which increased significantly (p = 0.05), and also cardio-embolic stroke, the incidence of which fell significantly (p = 0.01). Twenty-eight-day case-fatality rates fell significantly, especially for lacunar stroke (p = 0.05) and primary cerebral hemorrhage (p = 0.03). The frequency of hypercholesterolemia and diabetes increased significantly (p < 0.01). In contrast, the frequency of myocardial infarction fell significantly (p = 0.02). The frequency of smoking and diastolic blood pressure J 90 mmHg also fell, but the difference was not significant because of missing data. The frequency of pre-stroke antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatment increased significantly (p < 0.01). The age - and sex-adjusted incidence rates of stroke in Dijon, France, have thus been stable for the past 20 years. Age at stroke onset has increased, the case-fatality rate has fallen, antiplatelet treatment is more frequent, and the frequency of some pre-stroke risk factors has fallen.",,Yannick Bejot;Maurice Giroud;Olivier Rouaud;Isabelle Benatru;Thibault Moreau;Marc Freycz;Guy Victor Osseby;Neurologues Hospitaliers et Libéraux de Dijon

Methods- This observational study was based on a prospective database of acute ischemic strokes treated by mechanical thrombectomy. Inclusion criteria were patients with acute anterior ischemic stroke, diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging, including a T2*-gradient echo imaging sequence, and treated by mechanical thrombectomy. Two independent readers assessed the presence of an SVS. Successful recanalization was defined as a Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2b-3 after mechanical thrombectomy. Early clinical improvement was estimated by the difference between the baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale on day 1 after treatment Results- The SVS was detected in 137 (76%) out of 180 patients. The kappa interrater agreement was 0.71 with a 95% CI of 0.59 to 0.82. Successful recanalization was associated with an SVS+ with odds ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.05-5.74; P=0.03. The early clinical improvement was better in patients with an SVS+ (median, -6; interquartile range, -11 to 0) compared with SVS- patients (median, -1; interquartile range, -10 to 3) with P=0.01.

All patients had a comprehensive stroke work-up to ascertain their stroke risk factors and their stroke etiology applying TOAST criteria. Minority groups were younger compared with the white stroke patients, with the mean age significantly lower in the Asian-Indian and the Hispanic groups. The male:female ratio favored males in the Asian-Indian and Hispanic subgroups and females in the Caucasian and African-American groups. Diabetes was more prevalent in the minority subgroups, with a highest prevalence (55%) noted in the Asian-Indian group.

Case report,"Vertebral artery (VA) occlusion by rotation of the head is uncommon, but can result from mechanical compression of the artery, trauma, or atlantoaxial instability. Occipital bone anomalies rarely cause rotational VA occlusion, and patients with nontraumatic intermittent occlusion of the VA usually present with compromised vertebrobasilar flow. A 34-year-old man suffered three embolic strokes in the vertebrobasilar system within 2 months. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated multiple infarcts in the vertebrobasilar territory. Angiography performed immediately after the third attack displayed an embolus in the right posterior cerebral artery. Radiographic and three-dimensional computerized tomography bone images exhibited an anomalous osseous process of the occipital bone projecting to the posterior arch of the atlas. Dynamic angiography indicated complete occlusion of the left VA between the osseous process and the posterior arch while the patient's head was turned to the right. Surgical decompression of the VA resulted in complete resolution of rotational occlusion of the artery.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14694285/,Statins and stroke prevention,"Four randomized trials with a statin and one trial with a fibrate showed a modest but significant absolute reduction in the incidence of stroke in patients with a previous myocardial infarction. The reasons for the positive effect of statins on stroke end-point are unclear since, paradoxically, the link between serum cholesterol level and stroke has never been fully established. Furthermore, the positive results of statins trials were mainly obtained in patients with an average or a low serum cholesterol level. This suggests nonhypolipidemic effects of these drugs, so-called pleiotropic effects, acting on the biologic promoters of plaque instability. Statins have a good overall safety profile with no increase of hemorrhagic stroke and no increase in cancer. They have positive effects in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in high-risk young as well as elderly populations. Statins reduced stroke incidence in high-risk (mainly CHD, diabetics and hypertensives) population even with a normal baseline blood cholesterol level, which argues for a global cardiovascular risk-based treatment strategy. In patients with prior strokes, statins likely reduce the incidence of cononary events, but it is not yet proven that statins actually reduce the incidence of recurrent strokes in secondary prevention. If current hypotheses are verified by ongoing trials, we may expect between 20 to 30 more stroke events avoided per 1,000 patients treated during 2 years with a lipid-lowering agent, which adds to the 28 stroke events prevented with an antiplatelet agent over the same time period.

Additionally, potential factors responsible for the discrepancies in stroke rates in the current literature are analysed and a lack of uniform neurological definitions and standardized neurological assessments revealed. Current stroke rates after TAVR show a decline from 7 to 1.7-4.8% in recent studies. Randomized studies comparing TAVR with SAVR yielded initially a significantly higher stroke rate after TAVR procedures as opposed to SAVR. Recently published data showed opposite results with strokes being higher following SAVR. Current data concerning stroke after surgical valve replacement report significantly higher rates of clinical strokes (17%) than previously mentioned in the literature (≤4.9%). Silent cerebral lesions were detected in 68-93% after TAVR and 38-54% after SAVR.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32391806/,"Immune responses to stroke: mechanisms, modulation, and therapeutic potential","Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of disability. Most strokes are caused by occlusion of a major cerebral artery, and substantial advances have been made in elucidating how ischemia damages the brain. In particular, increasing evidence points to a double-edged role of the immune system in stroke pathophysiology. In the acute phase, innate immune cells invade brain and meninges and contribute to ischemic damage, but may also be protective. At the same time, danger signals released into the circulation by damaged brain cells lead to activation of systemic immunity, followed by profound immunodepression that promotes life-threatening infections. In the chronic phase, antigen presentation initiates an adaptive immune response targeted to the brain, which may underlie neuropsychiatric sequelae, a considerable cause of poststroke morbidity. Here, we briefly review these pathogenic processes and assess the potential therapeutic value of targeting immunity in human stroke.",,Costantino Iadecola;Marion S Buckwalter;Josef Anrather

We sought to examine the frequency and clinical correlates of suicidal ideas 3 and 15 months after stroke. The study group comprised 286 of 486 consecutive patients aged 55-85 years who at 3 and 15 months after ischemic stroke completed a detailed medical, neurological and radiological stroke evaluation, structured measures of cognition (Mini Mental State Examination), emotion (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI), disability (Rankin scale), and assessment of dependent living. Suicidal ideas were present in 9.8% (n = 28) at 3 months' follow-up and in 14.0% (n = 40) at 15 months' follow-up. The patients with suicidal ideas were more depressed measured by BDI both at 3 (17.0 vs. 7.9, p < 0.001) and 15 months (20.5 vs. 8.5, p < 0.001) after stroke compared to the patients without suicidal ideas. Patients with suicidal ideas had more often a history of a stroke already before the index stroke (35 vs. 18.3%, p = 0.0154), right-sided stroke (60.0 vs. 41.9%, p = 0.0323), they were more disabled according to the Rankin scale (2.4 vs. 1.9; p = 0.0035) and more dependent in living (45.0 vs. 27.2%, p = 0.023) 15 months after stroke. An independent correlate of suicidal ideas 15 months after stroke was history of prior stroke (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.14-4.97) in logistic regression analysis. The frequency of suicidal ideas increased with the time elapsed from stroke. Recurrent strokes, depressive symptoms, more disabling stroke and right-sided stroke correlated to suicidal ideas at 15 months after stroke.

The present therapy for acute ischemic stroke is limited to thrombolysis with the recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA). However, rtPA has a narrow therapeutic timeframe of 3-4.5 h, and only approximately 5% of stroke patients can benefit from rtPA treatment. Neuroprotective agents, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, have shown great promise in preclinical studies. However, due to a limited therapeutic time window and/or intolerable side effects, they have failed in clinical trials. Extending the time window and reducing side effects for neuroprotective drugs against strokes are critical for effective therapy for stroke patients. A recent study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Irène R. Chassagnon et al. (2017) indicates that Hi1a, a disulfide-rich spider venom peptide, is a highly neuroprotective agent in both in vitro and in vivo studies against experimental stroke.

A total of 306 caregivers completed the questionnaires, including the Caregiver Preparedness Scale, the Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale, and Knowledge of Stroke. The result showed that the mean score of the family caregivers' preparedness was 14.42, the mean score of disease uncertainty was 75.62, and the mean score of stroke knowledge was 10.41. Caregiver preparedness was negatively correlated with disease uncertainty and positively correlated with knowledge. Multivariate stepwise regression analysis showed that educational background, profession, caregiving experience and uncertainty degree of the family caregivers, gender, and age of stroke survivor could predict 45.90% of the total variation in preparedness. The findings suggest that demographic characteristics of stroke survivor and family caregiver, as well as caregivers' disease uncertainty, enable predict the level of caregiver preparedness.

The aim of this study was to investigate if markers of insulin resistance were associated with risk of stroke in the general elderly population. This study was part of the large population-based Rotterdam Study and included 5,234 participants who were aged 55 years or older and stroke free and diabetes free at baseline (1997-2001). Fasting insulin levels and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance were used as markers for insulin resistance. Cox regression was used to determine associations between insulin resistance markers and stroke risk, adjusted for age, sex, and potential confounders. During 42,806 person-years of follow-up (median: 8.6 years), 366 first-ever strokes occurred, of which 225 were cerebral infarctions, 42 were intracerebral hemorrhages, and 99 were unspecified strokes. Fasting insulin levels were not associated with risk of any stroke, cerebral infarction, or intracerebral hemorrhage. Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, which almost perfectly correlated with fasting insulin levels, was also not associated with risk of stroke or stroke subtypes. In conclusion, in this population-based cohort study among nondiabetic elderly, insulin resistance markers were not associated with risk of stroke or any of its subtypes.",,Renske G Wieberdink;Peter J Koudstaal;Albert Hofman;Jacqueline C M Witteman;Monique M B Breteler;M Arfan Ikram

About a third of them remain unexplained even after an extensive etiological assessment. A large part of these unexplained strokes could be linked to illegal drug abuse, and 10 % are estimated to be directly linked to illegal drugs in some international studies. The most frequently incriminated recreational drug remains cocaine, via several mechanisms. However, several other illegal drugs, some very commonly used such as cannabis, are suspected to have an important role in neurovascular diseases.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31601801/,Ischaemic stroke,"Stroke is the second highest cause of death globally and a leading cause of disability, with an increasing incidence in developing countries. Ischaemic stroke caused by arterial occlusion is responsible for the majority of strokes. Management focuses on rapid reperfusion with intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy, which both reduce disability but are time-critical. Accordingly, improving the system of care to reduce treatment delays is key to maximizing the benefits of reperfusion therapies. Intravenous thrombolysis reduces disability when administered within 4.5 h of the onset of stroke. Thrombolysis also benefits selected patients with evidence from perfusion imaging of salvageable brain tissue for up to 9 h and in patients who awake with stroke symptoms. Endovascular thrombectomy reduces disability in a broad group of patients with large vessel occlusion when performed within 6 h of stroke onset and in patients selected by perfusion imaging up to 24 h following stroke onset. Secondary prevention of ischaemic stroke shares many common elements with cardiovascular risk management in other fields, including blood pressure control, cholesterol management and antithrombotic medications. Other preventative interventions are tailored to the mechanism of stroke, such as anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation and carotid endarterectomy for severe symptomatic carotid artery stenosis.",,Bruce C V Campbell;Deidre A De Silva;Malcolm R Macleod;Shelagh B Coutts;Lee H Schwamm;Stephen M Davis;Geoffrey A Donnan

Many stroke patients, upon discharge, went to another short-stay hospital or a long-term care institution. In addition, outpatient or in-home services (including rehabilitation) are often provided to those who have had a stroke, to prevent future strokes and to restore functioning (6,7). In 2011, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced its ""Million Hearts"" campaign, which aims to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes over the next 5 years (8). Efforts like this are especially important because the baby boomer population is aging into the years when strokes are more common.

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) reduces the risk of stroke in patients with symptomatic stenosis and - to a lesser degree - with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Endovascular treatment including balloon angioplasty and carotid artery stenting (CAS) has emerged as an alternative to CEA to treat carotid stenosis. The present review summarises the existing evidence on risks and benefits of CAS in comparison with CEA, with a focus on evidence from randomised clinical trials. Across all randomised trials, CEA was associated with a lower risk of peri-procedural stroke or death than CAS, while CAS had lower risks of myocardial infarction, cranial nerve palsy and access site haematoma. The increased stroke risk with CAS is mainly observed in elderly patients; therefore, CAS appears to be a safe option to CEA in younger patients. In the first few years following treatment, both procedures are equally effective in preventing ipsilateral recurrent strokes. Nevertheless, long-term follow-up of ongoing trials must be awaited to investigate whether a potential increase in recurrent stenosis following CAS might limit the long-term effectiveness in stroke prevention. The optimal treatment for asymptomatic carotid stenosis remains to be determined in ongoing clinical trials.",,Leo H Bonati;Stefan T Engelter;Philippe A Lyrer

Using PA and fMRI in patients with spatial neglect after an acute right-hemispheric stroke, we previously observed post-PA increases in activity in bilateral parietal, frontal, and occipital cortex during specific visuo-spatial tasks (bisection and visual search). However, given a key role of parietal areas for PA in healthy individuals, we hypothesized that such activation might differ according to the site of brain damage. We studied a group of 10 patients with focal right hemisphere stroke and spatial neglect at baseline and after PA, who were divided in two groups (5 patients with frontal and 5 patients with parietal strokes). We compared their behavioural performance and brain activation patterns during fMRI. At the behavioural level, frontal and parietal patients showed similar neglect signs on visuo-spatial tasks before PA, but frontal patients showed larger benefit from PA. Differences were also observed in cortical activity, with enhanced recruitment of right parietal areas in frontal patients and less consistent patterns in parietal patients. Furthermore, fMRI analysis during PA itself (divided in 5 successive periods) showed differential activations between group in anatomically preserved pathways, including occipital areas and cerebellum, that preceded changes in parietal areas and were specific to frontal patients. These data accord with the hypothesis that intact cerebello-parietal connections may underpin improvement of spatial neglect after PA. Altogether, these results provide important insights on brain networks involved in spatial cognition and may allow an optimal selection of patients benefiting from PA after right hemispheric stroke.",Frontal lobe; Parietal lobe; Prism adaptation; Spatial neglect; fMRI.,Arnaud Saj;Yann Cojan;Frédéric Assal;Patrik Vuilleumier

Warfarin has long been the cornerstone for decreasing risks of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and its efficacy has been well established. However, 14-44% of patients with atrial fibrillation who are at risk of stroke are ineligible for anticoagulation therapy, mostly owing to the risks of major bleeding and falls.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33462301/,Characteristics of strokes associated with centrifugal flow left ventricular assist devices,"Stroke is a devastating complication of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy. Understanding the characteristics, risk factors and outcomes of strokes associated with the centrifugal flow LVADs is important to devise better strategies for management and prevention. This is a retrospective cohort study at a single US academic medical center. The cohort includes patients who received a first time Heartmate 3 (HM3) or Heartware (HVAD) LVAD between September 2009 through February 2018 and had a stroke while the LVAD was in place. Descriptive statistics were used when appropriate. A logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors of poor outcome. Out of a total of 247 patients, 12.1% (N = 30, 24 HVAD and 6 HM3) had a stroke (63% ischemic) and 3 of these patients had pump thrombosis. Events per patient year (EPPY) were similar for HVAD and HM3 patients (0.3 ± 0.1). INR was subtherapeutic in 47.4% of ischemic stroke patients and supratherapeutic in 18.2% of hemorrhagic stroke patients. Concurrent infections were more common in the setting of hemorrhagic stroke than ischemic stroke (45.4% vs 5.3%, p = 0.008). Strokes were severe in most cases, with initial NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) higher in HM3 patients compared to HVAD patients (mean 24.6 vs 16) and associated with high in-patient mortality (21.1% of ischemic stroke vs. 88.8% of hemorrhagic stroke). Predictors of death within 30 days and disability at 90 days included creatinine at stroke onset, concurrent infection, hemorrhaghic stroke, and initial stroke severity (NIHSS). A score derived from these variables predicted with 100% certainty mortality at 30 days and mRS ≥ 4 at 90 days. For patients with centrifugal flow LVADs, ischemic strokes were more common but hemorrhagic strokes were associated with higher in-patient mortality and more frequently seen in the setting of concurrent infections. Infections, sub or supratherapeutic INR range, and comorbid cardiovascular risk factors may all be contributing to the stroke burden.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15152748/,Pharmacoeconomics of atrial fibrillation and stroke prevention,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia that significantly increases the risk of stroke by the formation and embolism of left-atrial appendage thrombi. This risk can be substantially reduced with antithrombotic therapies such as aspirin or warfarin. Those with the highest risk receive the most benefit from adjusted-dose warfarin compared with aspirin or low-dose warfarin. Because of its efficacy in reducing strokes, adjusted-dose warfarin has been shown to be cost-effective in several different settings, but mostly for AF patients with at least 1 additional risk factor. Warfarin must be adjusted to international normalized ratios (INRs) within the target range of 2.0 to 3.0 to minimize the risk--as well as the cost--of stroke and bleeding.

Most epidemiological studies exclude events within the first 28 days (eg, Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease [MONICA]) or events within 21 days in the same territory as the presenting event (eg, most stroke incidence studies). However, recurrence is most common during this early period and these restrictive definitions could underestimate the benefits of early prevention.",,Andrew J Coull;Peter M Rothwell
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10519882/,Should computed tomography appearance of lacunar stroke influence patient management?,"Patients with a lacunar stroke syndrome may have cortical infarcts on brain imaging rather than lacunar infarcts, and patients with the clinical features of a small cortical stroke (partial anterior circulation syndrome, PACS) may have lacunar infarcts on imaging. The aim was to compare risk factors and outcome in lacunar syndrome (LACS) with cortical infarct, LACS with lacunar infarct, PACS with cortical infarct, and PACS with lacunar infarct to determine whether the clinical syndrome should be modified according to brain imaging. As part of a hospital stroke registry, patients with first ever stroke from 1990 to 1998 were assessed by a stroke physician who assigned a clinical classification using clinical features only. A neuroradiologist classified recent clinically relevant infarcts on brain imaging as cortical, posterior cerebral artery territory or lacunar. Of 1772 first ever strokes, there were 637 patients with PACS and 377 patients with LACS who had CT or MRI. Recent infarcts were seen in 395 PACS and 180 LACS. Atrial fibrillation was more common in PACS with cortical than lacunar infarcts (OR 2.3, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.9-5.5), and in LACS with cortical than lacunar infarcts (OR 3.9, 1.2-12). Severe ipsilateral carotid stenosis or occlusion was more common in PACS with cortical than lacunar infarcts (OR 3.5, 1.3-9.5); and in LACS with cortical than lacunar infarcts (OR 3.7, 1.1-12). In conclusion, patients with cortical infarcts are more likely to have severe ipsilateral carotid stenosis or atrial fibrillation than those with lacunar infarcts irrespective of the presenting clinical syndrome. Brain imaging should modify the clinical classification and influence patient investigation.",,G E Mead;S C Lewis;J M Wardlaw;M S Dennis;C P Warlow

The technical feasibility of carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been established. Short-term results have been conflicting. Despite this, many practices have adopted CAS as an alterative to carotid endarterectomy in high-risk patients. Long-term protective benefits, however, are less established in high-risk patients. Midterm results following CAS in our high-risk protocol were analyzed to determine specific and all-cause mortality rates (beyond 30 days). We retrospectively evaluated a prospective carotid artery stent registry from October 2003 to February 2006. Demographics, high-risk indication, presence of carotid symptoms, prior history of cancer, periprocedural success, complications, as well as follow-up including readmission rate as well as specific etiology of death were recorded. Fifty patients with critical carotid stenosis (mean stenosis 90%) underwent CAS. This cohort met high-risk criteria due to physiologic reasons in 26 patients and anatomic factors in 22 cases. Two patients met both criteria. Indications were symptomatic disease in 14 (30%) and asymptomatic in 36 cases. The overall 30-day stroke, myocardial infarction, and death rate was 2%. No minor or major strokes were recorded within 30 days postprocedure. Overall average follow-up was 11-28 months. Stroke-free survival was 94% for all patients. Overall 1-year survival was 75% for all patients, significantly higher for the asymptomatic group (88%) (p < 0.01). Late mortality after 30 days was 11 cases (22%) at an average of 9 months post-CAS, ranging 3-13 months. No late mortality was due to ischemic stroke. Specific etiologies of mortality included end-stage cardiac disease (n = 1), recurrent or metastatic cancer (n = 2), acute cardiac event (n = 1), infectious complications (n = 3), and other (n = 3). Only symptomatic indication was predictive of late mortality. Clinicians may continue to cautiously offer CAS to asymptomatic high-risk patients given their anticipated longevity.

Initial workup upon return of spontaneous circulation revealed a large right atrial mass, patent foramen ovale (PFO), and bilateral acute cortical infarctions. This constellation of findings were concerning for PFO-related paradoxical embolic strokes. Given the risk of recurrent paradoxical embolic events and the absolute contraindication to thrombolysis due to recent cerebral infarction, the decision was made to proceed with percutaneous vacuum-assisted thrombectomy using the AngioVac device. To prevent intraoperative thrombus propagation, PFO-closure was performed immediately prior to thrombectomy.

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of CaW in patients with AIS or transient ischemic attack (TIA) based on head/neck CT angiography (CTA) in a Polish cohort study. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was performed by analyzing 1480 electronic clinical and imaging data regarding patients with AIS or TIA, hospitalized in the years 2018-2020 in the authors' institution. The final sample consisted of 181 patients who underwent head/neck CTA; aged 67.81 ± 13.51 years (52% were women). All head/neck CTA studies were independently evaluated by two radiologists. The patient's clinical condition was assessed with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS, 5.76 ± 4.05 and 2.88 ± 3.38 at admission and at discharge, respectively). Results: 27 patients were identified with CaW. The prevalence of CaW in the final sample (181 pts with good quality CTA) was 14.9%. In the CaW group, 89% patients had AIS, including 26% diagnosed with recurrent and 11% with cryptogenic strokes. There were no significant differences between the presence of CaW and gender, age, NIHSS score, recurrent or cryptogenic stroke. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that CaW may be an underrecognized entity leading to cerebrovascular events. The diagnosis of CaW depends on a high level of awareness and a comprehensive analysis of the neuroimaging studies. Our findings support the hypothesis that it is worthwhile to perform CTA to determine the etiology of ischemic stroke, particularly if predicting factors were not identified.",CT angiography; angiography; carotid web; fibromuscular dysplasia; ischemic stroke.,Michalina Rzepka;Tomasz Chmiela;Joanna Bosowska;Maciej Cebula;Ewa Krzystanek

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28049565/,Adapting the concepts of brain and cognitive reserve to post-stroke cognitive deficits: Implications for understanding neglect,"Advanced lesion mapping and connectivity analyses are currently the main tools used to understand the mechanisms underlying post-stroke cognitive deficits. However, the factors contributing to pre-stroke architecture of cognitive networks are often ignored, even though they reportedly play a decisive role in the manifestation of cognitive impairment in neurodegeneration. The present review on post-stroke cognitive deficits therefore adopts the concept of brain and cognitive reserve, which was originally developed to account for the individual differences in the course of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. By focusing on spatial neglect, a typical network disorder, it is discussed how individual susceptibility to stroke lesion might explain the reported discrepancies in lesion anatomy, non-spatial deficits and recovery courses. A detailed analysis of the literature reveals that premorbid brain (age, brain atrophy, previous strokes, leukoaraiosis, genetic factors, etc.) and cognitive reserve (IQ, life experience, education, occupation, premorbid cognitive impairment, etc.) greatly impact the brain's capacity for compensation. Furthermore, the interaction between pre-stroke brain/cognitive reserve and the degree of stroke-induced system impairment (e.g., hypoperfusion, lesion load) determines both the extent of neglect symptoms variability and the course of recovery. Premorbid brain/cognitive reserves should thus be considered to: (i) understand the mechanisms of post-stroke cognitive disorders and sufficiently explain their inter-individual variability; (ii) provide a prognosis for cognitive recovery and hence post-stroke dependency; (iii) identify individual targets for cognitive rehabilitation: in the case of reduced brain/cognitive reserve, neglect might occur even with a confined lesion, and non-spatial training of general attentional capacity should represent the main therapeutic target also for treatment of neglect; this might be true also for non-cognitive domains, e.g., motor deficit. This alternative view of how neglect and other cognitive deficits occur and recover promotes discussion about plasticity and recovery to a general rather than a single stroke-based domain, providing more efficiency in recovery research.",Cognitive reserve; Post-stroke cognitive deficit; Recovery from neglect; Spatial neglect; Stroke outcome; Stroke recovery.,Roza M Umarova

This study sought to examine the ability of LA strain in predicting subsequent stroke event in AF and also evaluated whether E/LA strain could predict cardiovascular (CV) events in these patients. In 190 persistent AF patients, we performed comprehensive echocardiography with assessment of LA strain. There were 69 CV events including 19 CV death, 32 hospitalizations for heart failure, 3 myocardial infarctions, and 15 strokes during an average follow-up of 29 months. Multivariate analysis showed old age, chronic heart failure, increased left ventricular (LV) mass index, and increased E/LA strain were associated with CV events and decreased LA strain was associated with subsequent stroke event. The addition of E/LA strain and LA strain to a model containing CHA2DS2-VASc score and LV function significantly improved the values in predicting CV events and subsequent stroke event, respectively. In conclusion, E/LA strain and LA strain were respectively useful in predicting CV events and subsequent stroke event in AF.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16601558/,Prospects for the prevention of stroke,"We are currently fighting a battle against a stroke epidemic. Implementation of new treatment strategies could save many patients in the future. The control of blood pressure is a major objective; however, choosing specific antihypertensive therapy (e.g. an agent blocking the renin-angiotensin system) is also important. The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study demonstrates potential benefits beyond blood pressure reduction of prescribing an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) compared with more established therapy in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Losartan-based therapy brought about regression of LVH and reduced incidences of fatal and non-fatal stroke by 25%, new-onset diabetes by 25% and atrial fibrillation by 30% more than atenolol-based therapy for a similar blood pressure control and better tolerability. The Study on COgnition and Prognosis in the Elderly (SCOPE) study, although difficult to interpret, does not contradict an ARB benefit beyond blood pressure lowering in primary prevention linked to targeting the angiotensin type 1 receptor. The findings of the MOrbidity and mortality after Stroke, Eprosartan compared with nitrendipine in Secondary prevention (MOSES) trial suggest clear-cut ARB benefits independent of blood pressure lowering in secondary stroke prevention. Experimental findings and other clinical evidence further support the benefits of ARBs in stroke prevention. Telmisartan is an ARB with a particularly interesting profile for stroke; given the 24-hour efficacy with more pronounced protection against the morning blood pressure surge and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activity at clinical doses.

Incidence of stroke in the Bahraini population (110/100,000) is now much greater than in the non-Bahraini population (27/100,000). The Bahraini stroke population is 10 years younger than Western comparators with a much higher prevalence of many of the risk factors for stroke, including diabetes (54%), hypertension (75%) and hyperlipidemia (34%). The combination of an ageing Bahraini population alongside a high prevalence of risk factors suggests a 'ticking time bomb' that is likely to see a continuing rise in the incidence of stroke. The quality of risk factor prevention and hospital-based stroke care is therefore crucial in Bahrain. While 88% of patients were scanned within 24 h and 86% with non-haemorrhagic strokes were commenced on aspirin within 48 h, none of the patients received thrombolysis or were admitted to a stroke unit. Improvement of stroke outcomes in Bahrain could be achieved through implementation of evidence-based measures, including improved risk factor management in primary care and stroke units and thrombolysis in secondary care.",Bahrain; audit; epidemiology; incidence; quality of care; stroke.,Mona Al Banna;Hassan Baldawi;Ali Kadhim;Hani Humaidan;David L Whitford

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24968547/,Dabigatran etexilate in atrial fibrillation,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects millions worldwide. Stroke is the most devastating complication of AF and is associated with a huge disease burden. As a preventive measure, anticoagulant therapy is recommended for most AF patients based on presence of stroke risk factors. For the past six decades warfarin remained the gold standard for stroke prevention in AF (SPAF). However, it is associated with numerous limitations such as a high risk of drug-drug, drug-food interactions and need for frequent INR (2-3) monitoring. Novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) dabigatran etexilate is a selective, specific, reversible direct thrombin inhibitor that has been approved in India for SPAF and primary venous thromboembolism prevention. The efficacy and safety of dabigatran in AF has been established the ""Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulant Therapy (RE-LY)"", a randomized clinical trial. RE-LY (n = 18,113) demonstrated that the efficacy of dabigatran 110 mg BID was as good as well controlled warfarin and dabigatran 150 mg BID reduced the risk of ischaemic stroke by 25% (P = 0.03). Till date, 150mg dabigatran is the only NOAC offering a superior reduction in most commonly seen ischemic strokes due to AF compared to warfarin. Additionally, both doses of dabigatran significantly reduced the risk of total bleeds, intracranial, and life threatening bleeds versus warfarin (p < 0.05). Dabigatran has advantages over warfarin including predictable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, minimal drug-drug and no drug-food interactions while no monitoring is needed.The 150 mg dose of dabigatran should be considered in younger patients with a low risk of bleeding and good renal function to achieve a superior ischemic stroke reduction, whereas, the 110 mg dose should be considered in elderly patients, those with mild to moderate renal function or those with high risk of bleeding.",,Amit Vora

While it seems logical to assume that their prevalence and their risk factors depend primarily on the considered type of stroke, most studies used inconsistent definitions or included heterogeneous populations, which limits their accuracy. Given these biases, the French Society of Neonatology and the French Centre for Paediatric Stroke wished to update the knowledge in this domain, focusing on a specific form of perinatal stroke, i.e neonatal arterial ischemic stroke (NAIS) in term or near term newborns. A comprehensive analysis of published epidemiological data was dedicated to the following issues: Is the prevalence of NAIS well defined from epidemiological studies? What are the best recognized risk factors and is it possible to delineate a maternal and fetal population at risk for this condition? On July 31, 2015 a total of four hospitalized-based and five population-based studies, and six case-control studies were found. The conclusions are the following: The prevalence of NAIS in term or near term newborns varies from 6 to 17/100,000 live births (level of evidence 2). NAIS represents a half of total ischemic perinatal strokes (i.e. including those with delayed presentation as well) and one fourth of perinatal strokes (i.e. including cerebral haemorrhage stroke as well). Four sets of risk factors are consistent across different studies (level of evidence 3): (1) male sex, (2) obstetrical determinants (first pregnancy, caesarean section), and two peripartum complications: (3) intrapartum hypoxia and (4) materno-fetal/neonatal infection. Bacterial meningitis, cardiac disorders/procedures and invasive care such as extra-corporeal circulation carry a risk of NAIS as well. A registry could help refining epidemiological descriptive data. It could also be used to develop etiological studies focusing on pathophysiological hypotheses derived from the identified aforementioned risk factors.",,V Darmency-Stamboul;A G Cordier;S Chabrier

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28989805/,Migraine and stroke,"Migraines are generally considered a relatively benign neurological condition. However, research has shown an association between migraines and stroke, and especially between migraine with aura and ischaemic stroke. Patients can also suffer from migrainous infarction, a subset of ischaemic stroke that often occurs in the posterior circulation of younger women. The exact pathogenesis of migrainous infarct is not known, but it is theorised that the duration and local neuronal energy level from cortical spreading depression may be a key factor. Other factors contributing to migrainous infarct may include vascular, inflammatory, endothelial structure, patent foramen ovale, gender, oral contraceptive pill use and smoking. Vasoconstrictors such as the triptan and ergot class are commonly used to treat migraines and may also play a role. Migraine is also shown to be correlated to haemorrhagic stroke, although studies do not demonstrate causation versus association, and further studies are warranted. There are also some rare genetic diseases such as cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy and others, which can cause both migraines and infarcts. On imaging, many migraineurs are found to have white matter changes similar to those seen in patients with stroke. These may be caused in part by alterations in resting cerebral blood flow and vasoconstrictor use. In treating patients with migraines, it is important to identify and modify any vascular risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, oral contraceptive pill use and lifestyle factors. Further studies will determine if more aggressive treatment of migraines can ultimately lead to fewer strokes in this population.",ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke; migraine; migraine with aura; migrainous infarction.,Yonghua Zhang;Aasheeta Parikh;Shuo Qian

To address these deficits, it is essential for clinicians and researchers to precisely identify mild stroke survivors. Despite the fact that half of all strokes are categorized as mild, no standards exist on what constitutes a ""mild"" stroke. The purpose of this study is to summarize the current classification of mild stroke using a mapping review approach. Strategies to categorize ""mild stroke"" severity were explored in 188 papers indexed in the PubMed database. The results indicate that there was substantial variability in the procedures and scoring criteria used to determine mild stroke. To identify persons with mild stroke, researchers have largely applied assessment instruments developed to inform acute stroke care (eg, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index). Unfortunately, these approaches demonstrate floor effects and fail to detect the long-term disabling impairments that often limit the outcomes of mild stroke survivors.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23469845/,Oxidative stress and pathophysiology of ischemic stroke: novel therapeutic opportunities,"Stroke is the second leading cause of death, after ischemic heart disease, and accounts for 9% of deaths worldwide. According to the World Health Organization [WHO], 15 million people suffer stroke worldwide each year. Of these, more than 6 million die and another 5 million are permanently disabled. Reactive oxygen species [ROS] have been implicated in brain injury after ischemic stroke. There is evidence that a rapid increase in the production of ROS immediately after acute ischemic stroke rapidly overwhelm antioxidant defences, causing further tissue damage. These ROS can damage cellular macromolecules leading to autophagy, apoptosis, and necrosis. Moreover, the rapid restoration of blood flow increases the level of tissue oxygenation and accountsfor a second burst of ROS generation, which leads to reperfusion injury. Current measures to protect the brain against severe stroke damage are insufficient. Thus, it is critical to investigate antioxidant strategies that lead to the diminution of oxidative injury. The antioxidant vitamins C and E, the polyphenol resveratrol, the xanthine oxidase [XO] inhibitor allopurinol, and other antioxidant strategies have been reviewed in the setting of strokes.

Forms of stroke resulting from vascular occlusion are arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) and sinovenous thrombosis (SVT) and those resulting from vascular rupture are called hemorrhagic stroke. Stroke in children is relatively rare and frequently results in a lack of recognition and delay in diagnosis. The etiologies of stroke in children are legion and multiple risk factors coexist unlike unifactorial etiology in adults. Heart disease whether congenital or acquired, malformations, metabolic and hematological disorders and vasospastic conditions like migraine are seen more often in childhood strokes. The purpose of diagnostic evaluation includes confirmation of the presence of a cerebrovascular lesion, exclusion of other types of neurological dysfunction and identification of etiology of the stroke. The treatment of stroke in children has been primarily directed toward stabilizing systemic factors and management of the underlying causes. Various antithrombotic and non antithrombotic therapies are discussed. The use of anticoagulant therapy appears to be increasing in pediatric AIS.

Setting The First Hospital of Hebei Medical University, China. Method Ischemic stroke patients were enrolled in the study. Upon hospital discharge, patients were randomly allocated either to a control group (CG, no pharmaceutical care) or to an intervention group (IG, monthly pharmaceutical care follow-up for 6 months). The interventions aimed to increase medication adherence and improve risk factor control through education and counseling. Medication adherence and surrogate laboratory markers of risk factors were assessed and compared between the two groups. Main outcome measures Blood pressure, blood glucose, lipid profile, and medication adherence. Results A total of 184 patients with ischemic strokes were randomly assigned, and 84 patients in IG and 82 in CG were analyzed.

The objective of this study is to detect the subgroup of patients with such presentations having minor strokes whom may benefit from primary and secondary stroke prevention. We conducted a retrospective analysis and stratified patient risk factors associated with positive findings on subsequent head MRI ordered by the emergency department physician following a normal head CT. Two hundred fifty-two patients presenting with atypical stroke symptoms to the emergency department had a negative head CT followed by head MRI within 24 h ordered by emergency department clinician (123 males and 129 females; mean age of 59.4). Twenty nine of the 252 patients (11.5 %) had findings of acute to subacute infarct on the subsequent MRI. Positive MRI findings were statistically correlated with the following variables: age (p < 0.001), history of hyperlipidemia (p = 0.019), hypertension (p < 0.001), diabetes (p = 0.004), anticoagulation use (p = 0.029), and prior transient ischemic attack or stroke (p < 0.001).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20088729/,Gender differences in patients with acute ischemic stroke,"Stroke has a greater effect on women than men owing to the fact that women have more stroke events and are less likely to recover. Age-specific stroke rates are higher in men; however, because of women's longer life expectancy and the much higher incidence of stroke at older ages, women have more stroke events than men overall. The aims of this prospective study in consecutive patients were to assess whether there are gender differences in stroke risk factors, treatment or outcome. Consecutive patients with ischemic stroke were included in this prospective study at four study centers. Disability was assessed using a modified Rankin Scale score (>or=3 indicating disabling stroke) in both genders at 90 days. Outcomes and risk factors in both genders were compared using the chi(2) test. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify any independent predictors of outcome. A total of 1136 patients were included in this study; of these, 494 (46%) were female. Women were statistically older compared with men: 76.02 (+/- 12.93) and 72.68 (+/- 13.27) median years of age, respectively. At admission, females had higher NIH Stroke Scale scores compared with males (9.4 [+/- 6.94] vs 7.6 [+/- 6.28] for men; p = 0.0018). Furthermore, females tended to have more cardioembolic strokes (153 [30%] vs 147 [23%] for men; p = 0.004). Males had lacunar and atherosclerotic strokes more often (146 [29%] vs 249 [39%] for men; p = 0.002, and 68 [13%] vs 123 [19%] for men; p = 0.01, respectively). The mean modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months was also significantly different between genders, at 2.5 (+/- 2.05) for women and 2.1 (+/- 2.02) for men (p = 0.003). However, at multivariate analysis, female gender was not an indicator for negative outcome. It was concluded that female gender was not an independent factor for negative outcome. In addition, both genders demonstrated different stroke pathophysiologies.

Data from the literature do not indicate the role of PFO and/or atrial septal aneurysm in pathogenesis of first-ever and recurrent stroke. Antithrombotics seem to decrease the risk of stroke recurrence, but oral anticoagulants also increase the risk of haemorrhagic complications. Results of studies on percutaneous or surgical closure of PFO are insufficient to make clinical therapeutic decisions.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16179888/,Carotid artery intervention,"Atherosclerotic carotid artery disease is a major contributor to the incidence of stroke, particularly in the elderly. Atherosclerosis is a systemic illness and patients often present with multisystem involvement of several vascular beds including coronary, cerebral, and peripheral vascular territories. The majority of strokes related to carotid artery disease are embolic in nature, not occlusive. Non-invasive screening tests including ultrasound, CT angiography and MR angiography are helpful in identifying pathology. However, the gold standard, for diagnosis and treatment allocation remains invasive angiography. Medical therapy to reduce the risk of stroke includes antiplatelet agents, primarily aspirin in doses of 81 mg to 325 mg per day. Control of blood pressure and the use of statin therapy is effective in reducing the incidence of stroke. Carotid endarterectomy is more effective for preventing stroke in symptomatic (transient ischemic attack or stroke) patients with = or >50% diameter stenosis and asymptomatic patients with = or >60% diameter stenosis, than aspirin therapy. In patients at increased risk for surgical complications during stroke prevention surgery (carotid endarterectomy), carotid stents have been shown to be as good or better than surgery at improving outcomes.",,C J White

Stroke is the second cause of death in women worldwide with sex-specific causes of stroke in youger women such as pregnancy, post-partum period, oral contraception and migraine. Substitutive hormone treatment in older women is no more recommended in regard of the increased thromboembolic risk it generates. Venous thrombolysis with rtPA and mechanical thrombectomy are now proven to be as efficacious in women as in men. After a stroke, women present poorer quality of life than men attributable to age, more severe stroke, pre-stroke dependency and depression. Recent data concerning the latest epidemiological surveys reveal a shift in trends with the rise of incidence of strokes in young women (≤55 years and 64 years) contrasting with the stability of incidence rates in older women. As science is unvealing sex-related differences in cardiovascular disorders, health policies need to be adapted accordingly to improve stroke prevention and pre-stroke health in women.

They are the second leading cause of mortality in the general population, and the first in women. They also constitute a very high social spending, which is estimated to increase in coming years, due to the aging of our population. Data from the Hospital Morbidity Survey of the National Statistics Institute recorded, in 2011, 116,017 strokes and 14,933 transient ischemic attacks, corresponding, respectively, to an incidence of 252 and 32 events per 100,000 people. In 2002, the cost of hospitalization for each stroke was estimated at €3,047. The amount of total cost health care throughout the life of a stroke patient is calculated at €43,129. Internationally, the direct costs of stroke constitute 3% of national health spending, this being similar amount in different countries around us. Hypertension was the cardiovascular risk factor (CVRF) more prevalent in both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, followed by dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus. Peripheral arterial disease and hypertension were more frequently associated with atherothrombotic events, atrial fibrillation with cardioembolic strokes, and obesity and high blood pressure to lacunar infarcts. In Spain, as showing several studies, we are far from optimal control of CVRF, especially in secondary prevention of stroke. According to the ICTUSCARE study, achieving recommended values was 17.6% in the case of hypertension, 29.8% in LDL-cholesterol, 74.9% of smoking, and 50.2% in diabetes mellitus.

Epidemiological data highlight the increasing burden to come over the next decades. Without any doubt, antihypertensive treatment is the most important therapy to reduce the risk of stroke by approximately 30-40%. International guidelines recommend antihypertensive treatment for primary prevention with evidence level A. Recurrent strokes or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) are an important practical, clinical and economic problem, and have a major impact on the development of vascular dementia. All stroke patients and patients with TIA have to be regarded as very high-risk patients. Hypertension increases the risk of recurrent strokes. Only limited data directly address the role of blood pressure treatment among individuals with stroke or TIA. There is a general lack of definitive data regarding when to start antihypertensive treatment in the initial phase, and treatment of hypertension in the acute period after stroke is still under debate. Experimental and clinical data suggest that reducing the activity of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) may have beneficial effects beyond the lowering of blood pressure. There is increasing evidence of cerebroprotective effects for medication influencing the RAAS, such as angiotensin receptor antagonists or ACE inhibitors. The MOSES study showed for the first time superiority of an angiotensin receptor antagonist compared with a calcium channel antagonist in antihypertensive treatment for secondary stroke prevention. Optimal blood pressure range in secondary prevention seems to be 120-140/80-90 mm Hg, but questions about a J- or U-shaped curve are still not answered sufficiently. The effects of additional antihypertensive treatment in the evening for stroke patients with 'non-dipping' blood pressure need to be investigated.Currently, the most important goal in primary and secondary prevention of stroke is a strict normotensive blood pressure control. Antihypertensive treatment is recommended for both prevention of recurrent stroke and prevention of other vascular events in individuals who have had an ischaemic stroke or TIA (class I, level of evidence A). Many open questions remain and funding of stroke research needs to be increased in the near future.",,Stephan Lüders

Diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has been reported to be useful in the detection of acute strokes and as an investigative tool evaluating the therapeutic effects of neuroprotective and thrombolytic agents. The objectives of this study are to share our experience using the commercially available isotropic DW scan in imaging of acute stroke, assess its usefulness over conventional T2-weighted (T2W) scans in a busy clinical radiology unit and highlight it pitfalls. We found the rapid sub-minute DW technique well suited for ill and restless stroke patients and superior to T2W scans in many ways. It was highly sensitive to acute ischaemic lesions, made lesions easily identifiable and readily differentiated the acute lesion from a background of multiple chronic infarcts. However, there are potential pitfalls in the evaluation of small hyperacute posterior fossa strokes and venous infarcts. The major strength of this MR technique lies in its ability to diagnose hyperacute strokes and thence the potential for therapeutic thrombolysis, but unfortunately patients qualifying for the ""therapeutic window"" were a minority. More efforts need to be focused on public education in order for this powerful imaging modality to find its true value and contribute to viability of an effective thrombolytic programme.",,L L Chan;J B K Khoo;C H Thng;W E H Lim;K H Tay;E K Tan;H M Chang;C Chen;M C Wong;K P Tan

However, studies using the visual pathway as a paradigm for studying poststroke recovery are limited. In this article, we propose that the visual pathway has many features that make it an excellent model system for studying poststroke neuroplasticity and assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. First, the functional anatomy of the visual pathway is well characterized, which makes it well suited for functional neuroimaging studies of poststroke recovery. Second, there are multiple highly standardized and clinically available diagnostic tools and outcome measures that can be used to assess visual function in stroke patients. Finally, as a sensory modality, the assessment of vision is arguably less likely to be affected by confounding factors such as functional compensation and patient motivation. Given these advantages, and the general similarities between poststroke visual field recovery and recovery in other functional domains, future neurorehabilitation studies should consider using the visual pathway to better understand the physiology of neurorecovery and test potential therapeutics.",cortical blindness; hemianopia; rehabilitation research; stroke; stroke rehabilitation; vision disorders.,Ania Busza;Colleen L Schneider;Zoë R Williams;Bradford Z Mahon;Bogachan Sahin

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31151838/,Treatment Approaches to Lacunar Stroke,"Lacunar strokes are appropriately named for their ability to cavitate and form ponds or ""little lakes"" (Latin: lacune -ae meaning pond or pit is a diminutive form of lacus meaning lake). They account for a substantial proportion of both symptomatic and asymptomatic ischemic strokes. In recent years, there have been several advances in the management of large vessel occlusions. New therapies such as non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants and left atrial appendage closure have recently been developed to improve stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation; however, the treatment of small vessel disease-related strokes lags frustratingly behind. Since Fisher characterized the lacunar syndromes and associated infarcts in the late 1960s, there have been no therapies specifically targeting lacunar stroke. Unfortunately, many therapeutic agents used for the treatment of ischemic stroke in general offer only a modest benefit in reducing recurrent stroke while adding to the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage and systemic bleeding. Escalation of antithrombotic treatments beyond standard single antiplatelet agents has not been effective in long-term lacunar stroke prevention efforts, unequivocally increasing intracerebral hemorrhage risk without providing a significant benefit. In this review, we critically review the available treatments for lacunar stroke based on evidence from clinical trials. For several of the major drugs, we summarize the adverse effects in the context of this unique patient population.

Many recent, long-term clinical studies have confirmed that statin therapy results in a reduced risk of strokes, even in so-called ""normocholesterolemic"" patients. The magnitude of the effect is great. A large-scale analysis of more than 90,000 individuals showed that every 10% reduction in the concentration of LDL-cholesterol reduces the risk of stroke by 15.6%. The positive effect of statins on stroke depends mainly on LDL cholesterol reduction, but other non-lipid mechanisms, so-called ""pleiotropic"" effects, have been shown to play a role. This review seeks to summarize the role of statins in stroke prevention.

The blood pressure aimed at should be below 140/90 mmHg, in diabetic patients below 135/80 mmHg. There exist no special recommendations concerning the choice between the various antihypertensive drugs in use. As a matter of fact, it is advantageous to use in diabetic patients primarily ACE-inhibitors, if necessary in combination with calcium-antagonists. The profit of antihypertensive therapy in avoiding stroke is also proved among elderly patients. All vascular risks should be treated. In case of atrial fibrillation and of asymptomatic high-grade restriction of the carotic artery the indication for a surgical treatment respectively for a therapy with antiaggregating drugs should be considered. Secondary prevention: Hypertension after a cerebral ischemia increases the risk of a recurrent ischemic event. Antihypertensive therapy may probably reduce the risk of a recurrent stroke. Analyses performed so far are only incomplete on this subject. For the first time, the PROGRESS-study will show exact data. Special recommendations concerning the choice between the various antihypertensive drugs in use do not exist neither. Therefore, the recommendations of the German Hypertension League for secondary prevention correspond with those for primary prevention. Hypertension increases the risk of developing dementia.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22945688/,Pathophysiological mechanisms of carotid plaque vulnerability: impact on ischemic stroke,"Stroke is among the major causes of mortality and disabilities in the world. About 80 % of all strokes in the anterior circulation are ischemic and up to 20 % of all ischemic strokes are caused by extracranial atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis. The prevalence of a cervical internal carotid artery stenosis increases with age and can be found in 6.9 % of the elderly population (>65 years). Atherosclerotic changes of the carotid vessel wall can lead to plaque vulnerability and may result in arterio-arterial embolism, which frequently underlie carotid-related cerebrovascular ischemic events. Carotid atherosclerosis is characterised by inflammation, extensive degradation of extracellular matrix components, neovascularization, and as recently recognised is also affected by epigenetic changes. These factors accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis towards vulnerable plaques and increase the risk of ischemic stroke. In this review, the main pathophysiological mechanisms leading to rupture-prone carotid artery plaques and successive ischemic stroke are considered. It is important to recognise the heterogeneity of atherosclerosis and that various pathophysiological processes dissected in this review are not acting individually, but rather in a complementary manner. The identification and careful integration of all relevant factors will be required for the development of future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",,Jaroslav Pelisek;Hans-Henning Eckstein;Alma Zernecke
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18755487/,[Epilepsy and stroke],"Stroke is associated with an increased risk of subsequent seizures and epilepsy. Cerebrovascular lesions are the leading cause of epilepsy in the elderly, ahead of degenerative disorders, brain tumors and head trauma, accounting for up to one-third of newly diagnosed seizures in this population. The frequency of seizures in stroke victims varies from 5 to 20%, but only a minority will develop epilepsy. Based on differences in their presumed pathophysiology, seizures after stroke are usually divided into early and late seizures, according to various definitions. Early seizures are usually defined as those occurring within one or two weeks after stroke; late seizures usually occur within the first year after stroke. Several risk factors of seizures have been identified; stroke subtype and cortical location being the best-characterized predictors of seizure development. The optimal timing and type of anti-epileptic treatment remain debated. Several findings suggest that the majority of first generation anti-epileptic drugs are not the best choice in stroke patients.",,C Lamy

In Portugal, however, it is the leading cause of death. Intracerebral hemorrhages comprise approximately 10 to 15% of all strokes. This particular type of stroke is associated with a worse prognosis. There is little published data concerning stroke in the Portuguese population, especially on the hemorrhagic type of the disease. The aim of the present study was to improve our knowledge on the epidemiology of hemorrhagic strokes in our community. The hospital charts of 60 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage who were admitted to our wards during the years of 1997 and 1998 were retrospectively reviewed. There was a predominance of male patients aged over 65. In most cases (78.3%), no causal factor was identified (spontaneous or ""primary"" hemorrhagic stroke). Hypertension was present in 80% of cases and was the most common risk factor. The percentage of putaminal and thalamic hemorrhages (48.3%) was similar to the percentage of lobar hemorrhages (46.7%). This differs from other studies. The prognosis of our patients was fairly good, with 38% of all cases being independent at thirty days. The 30-day case fatality rate was 10%.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21121211/,"Sleep, ageing and stroke--newer directions in management of stroke","Stroke is a serious health problem and is chiefly a disorder of the elderly population. Several modifiable and non modifiable risk factors have been studied. The association of sleep disorders and stroke is exciting. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) which is now considered a systemic disease significantly increases the risk of stroke and death from any cause and the increase is independent of other risk factors including hypertension. There is high prevalence of OSA in the elderly. OSA affects the cerebral hemodynamics adversely. There appears to be a bi-directional relation between sleep disordered breathing(SDB) and cerebrovascular accidents. Strokes can themselves generate SDB. The presence of OSA in stroke patients is associated with poor outcome. Cyclical hypoxia and sympathetic stimulation has deleterious effects on cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and metabolic functions. The effects are particularly important in existing ischemic brain injury. Use of continuous positive pressure in OSA patients is rewarding. We propose that feeding through Ryle's tube may compromise with the patency of pharynx during sleep times and therefore this must be considered in management guidelines for stroke.",,S Ramanthan Iyer;Revati R Iyer
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30022799/,Controlling resistant hypertension,"Resistant hypertension (failure to achieve target blood pressures with three or more antihypertensive drugs including a diuretic) is an important and preventable cause of stroke. Hypertension is highly prevalent in China (>60% of persons above age 65), and only ~6% of hypertensives in China are controlled to target levels. Most strokes occur among persons with resistant hypertension; approximately half of strokes could be prevented by blood pressure control. Reasons for uncontrolled hypertension include (1) non-compliance; (2) consumption of substances that aggravated hypertension, such as excess salt, alcohol, licorice, decongestants and oral contraceptives; (3) therapeutic inertia (failure to intensify therapy when target blood pressures are not achieved); and (4) diagnostic inertia (failure to investigate the cause of resistant hypertension). In China, an additional factor is lack of availability of appropriate antihypertensive therapy in many healthcare settings. Sodium restriction in combination with a diet similar to the Cretan Mediterranean or the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet can lower blood pressure in proportion to the severity of hypertension. Physiologically individualised therapy for hypertension based on phenotyping by plasma renin activity and aldosterone can markedly improve blood pressure control. Renal hypertension (high renin/high aldosterone) is best treated with angiotensin receptor antagonists; primary aldosteronism (low renin/high aldosterone) is best treated with aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone or eplerenone); and hypertension due to overactivity of the renal epithelial sodium channel (low renin/low aldosterone; Liddle phenotype) is best treated with amiloride. The latter is far more common than most physicians suppose.",,J David Spence

Findings for hospitalised first-ever strokes (n = 125) during the first registration year (1998-1999) are presented here. The median age of the patients was 70 years for men and 79 years for women. Cerebral infarctions comprised 81.6% of the strokes. Patients were severely handicapped: at discharge from hospital about 46% of those 75 years or older and about 21% of those younger than 75 years had severe disability by Rankin Scale. Women were more impaired than men. After hospitalisation, 45% of those 75 years or older and 21% of those younger than 75 years were sent to nursing home. The prevalence of risk factors and comorbidity was high: 29% of men (52% of women) had high blood pressure, 22% of men (25% of women) had atrial fibrillation, 22% of both men and women had diabetes, and 50% of men and 33% of women were current smokers.

As heart disease is the most common risk factor, and as more and more cardiological interventions are being carried out, an increase in the incidence of paediatric stroke is expected. In some cases a transplant is required. While waiting for a donor, the use of ventricular assist devices may be necessary. These present with a high rate of neurological complications. We present two cases of children under 2 years of age awaiting heart transplantation supported by ventricular assist devices who had a stroke which was treated by endovascular techniques. Case 1: A 16-month-old boy with restrictive cardiomyopathy who was listed for a cardiac transplant. At 20 months he required an implantation of an external biventricular support device (Berlin Heart) and had a left hemisphere stroke at 23 months. An intra-arterial approach was used and produced good clinical results. One month later, a heart transplant was performed successfully. Case 2: An 18-month-old girl with non-compacted dilated cardiomyopathy included in the cardiac transplant programme and in need of a Levitronix Centrimag ventricular assist device presented with an acute left hemisphere stroke at 23 months.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22447068/,The role of angiotensin II receptors in stroke protection,"The hypothesis that angiotensin II (Ang II) might have a stroke-protective role was first proposed by Brown and Brown about 25 years ago. Their hypothesis was generated from the results of the first Medical Research Council trial in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, which showed that patients treated with the diuretic bendrofluazide had a 70% decrease in strokes compared with those treated with the β-blocker propranolol for similar blood pressure reduction. This hypothesis, which remained dormant for many years, was recently resurrected by several experimental studies that showed that the brain possesses its own renin-angiotensin system (RAS) similar to the one existing in the systemic circulation. These studies also showed that the brain RAS plays an important role in stroke prevention and neuronal protection through its active peptide Ang II. In addition, these studies demonstrated that the beneficial effects of Ang II are mediated through stimulation of its subtype 2 receptors, and possibly through stimulation of the subtype 4 receptors by Ang IV, a metabolite of Ang II. Drugs that selectively block the Ang II subtype 1 receptors, such as the angiotensin receptor blockers, have shown superior protection against strokes and neuronal damage than drugs that decrease the generation of Ang II, such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and β-blockers. In this review, the role of the Ang II receptors and their mechanism of action regarding stroke prevention are discussed in view of the evidence from experimental and clinical studies.",,Steven G Chrysant

However, the association between multiple myeloma and cerebrovascular events remains unclear. We therefore investigated multiple myeloma patients' risk factors for stroke to devise a better stroke-prevention strategy. This study includes consecutive patients 20 years and older who were newly diagnosed with symptomatic multiple myeloma at Taipei Veterans General Hospital, a tertiary medical center, between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2014. The primary outcome was stroke development. Patients with head injuries, brain tumors, brain parenchymal invasions, or antecedent malignancies were excluded. Hazard ratios (HRs) of stroke risk factors for multiple myeloma patients were estimated by Cox proportional regression analysis. Overall, 395 patients with a median age of 70 years were investigated. In the median follow-up period of 18 months, cerebrovascular events occurred in 16 patients, including 10 ischemic strokes and 6 hemorrhagic strokes. The 5-year estimated cumulative incidence rate was 7.45%. In the multivariate analysis, the κ light chain isotype (adjusted HR, 8.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.91-39.8), previous cerebrovascular accidents (adjusted HR, 5.16; 95% CI, 1.48-17.9), and serum creatinine > 2 mg/dL (adjusted HR, 4.21; 95% CI, 1.10-16.0) were identified as independent risk factors for stroke. Subgroup analysis showed that atrial fibrillation (adjusted HR, 8.07) and previous cerebrovascular accident (adjusted HR, 4.89) are significant risk factors for ischemic stroke. Serum creatinine > 2 mg/dL (adjusted HR, 30.6) and previous cerebrovascular accident (adjusted HR, 13.9) are significant for hemorrhagic stroke. Moreover, therapeutic strategies for multiple myeloma were not associated with stroke in our study. This study demonstrates that risk of stroke increases in myeloma patients with a κ light chain isotype, previous cerebrovascular events, and renal impairment.

Net water uptake (NWU) per brain volume is a new quantitative imaging biomarker of space-occupying ischemic edema, which can be measured in computed tomography (CT). We sought to investigate the effects of vessel recanalization on the formation of ischemic brain edema using quantitative NWU. In this multicenter observational study, acute ischemic stroke patients with a large vessel occlusion (LVO) in the anterior circulation were consecutively screened. Patients with vessel recanalization (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) 2 b or 3) versus persistent vessel occlusion (no thrombectomy, TICI 0-1) were compared. Lesion-NWU was quantified in multimodal admission CT and follow-up CT (FCT), and ΔNWU was calculated as difference. Of 194 included patients, 150 had successful endovascular recanalization and 44 persistent LVO. In FCT after treatment, the mean (standard deviation) ΔNWU was 15.8% (5.7) in patients with persistent LVO and 9.8% (5.8) with vessel recanalization (p < 0.001). In multivariate regression analysis, vessel recanalization was independently associated with a lowered ΔNWU by 6.3% compared to LVO (95% confidence interval: 3.7-9.0, p < 0.001). Successful vessel recanalization was associated with a significantly reduced formation of ischemic brain edema.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28522196/,Impact of glucose-lowering therapies on risk of stroke in type 2 diabetes,"Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have an increased risk of stroke compared with people without diabetes. However, the effects of glucose-lowering drugs on risk of ischaemic stroke in T2D have been less extensively investigated than in coronary heart disease. Some evidence, including the UKPDS, has suggested a reduced risk of stroke with metformin, although the number of studies is limited. Inhibition of the KATP channels increases ischaemic brain lesions in animals. This is in agreement with a recent meta-analysis showing an increased risk of stroke with sulphonylureas vs. various comparators as both mono- and combination therapy. Pioglitazone can prevent recurrence of stroke in patients with previous stroke, as already shown in PROactive, although results are less clear for first strokes. As for DPP-4 inhibitors, there was a non-significant trend towards benefit for stroke, whereas a possible increased risk of stroke with SGLT2 inhibitors-and in particular, empagliflozin in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial-has been suggested and requires clarification. Experimental results support a potential protective effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists against stroke that has, at least in part, been translated to clinical benefits in T2D patients in the LEADER and SUSTAIN-6 trials. Further interventional studies are now warranted to confirm the effects of glucose-lowering agents on risk of stroke in patients with T2D. In summary, the effects of antidiabetic drugs on risk of stroke appear to be heterogeneous, with some therapies (pioglitazone, GLP-1 receptor agonists) conferring possible protection against ischaemic stroke, other classes showing a neutral impact (DPP-4 inhibitors, insulin) and some glucose-lowering agents being associated with an increased risk of stroke (sulphonylureas, possibly SGLT2 inhibitors, high-dose insulin in the presence of insulin resistance).",Antidiabetic agents; Clinical trial; Comprehensive review; Stroke; Type 2 diabetes.,F Bonnet;A J Scheen

Monitoring of intracranial pressure in patients with THH which had factors mentioned above revealed the development of steadfast intracranial hypertension by days 5-7 maximally. The laying on EVD was indicated in patients with unfavourable signs of THH by means of ventricle drainage. The controlled decrease of intracranial pressure increased the level of awakening, meanwhile it decreased the degree of hydrochephalus and dislocation of brain stem.",,N V Vereshchagin;V V Peresedov;A V Shirshov;A I Kugoev
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22388811/,Treatment of stroke with a PSD-95 inhibitor in the gyrencephalic primate brain,"All attempts at treating strokes by pharmacologically reducing the human brain's vulnerability to ischaemia have failed, leaving stroke as a leading cause of death, disability and massive socioeconomic loss worldwide. Over decades, research has failed to translate over 1,000 experimental treatments from discovery in cells and rodents to use in humans, a scientific crisis that gave rise to the prevailing belief that pharmacological neuroprotection is not feasible or practicable in higher-order brains. To provide a strategy for advancing stroke therapy, we used higher-order gyrencephalic non-human primates, which bear genetic, anatomical and behavioural similarities to humans and tested neuroprotection by PSD-95 inhibitors--promising compounds that uncouple postsynaptic density protein PSD-95 from neurotoxic signalling pathways. Here we show that stroke damage can be prevented in non-human primates in which a PSD-95 inhibitor is administered after stroke onset in clinically relevant situations. This treatment reduced infarct volumes as gauged by magnetic resonance imaging and histology, preserved the capacity of ischaemic cells to maintain gene transcription in genome-wide screens of ischaemic brain tissue, and significantly preserved neurological function in neurobehavioural assays. The degree of tissue neuroprotection by magnetic resonance imaging corresponded strongly to the preservation of neurological function, supporting the intuitive but unproven dictum that integrity of brain tissue can reflect functional outcome. Our findings establish that tissue neuroprotection and improved functional outcome after stroke is unequivocally achievable in gyrencephalic non-human primates treated with PSD-95 inhibitors. Efforts must ensue to translate these findings to humans.",,Douglas J Cook;Lucy Teves;Michael Tymianski

Interestingly, the magnitude of the beneficial effect shown in this study is smaller than in similar studies, which included patients without a history of cerebrovascular disease. In SPARCL, an increased occurrence of hemorrhagic strokes in patients on statin treatment was observed, an effect that was also earlier described in the Heart Protection Study in a subgroup of patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease. The purpose of this systematic review was therefore to investigate the effect of statin treatment on the occurrence of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease.",,Mervyn D I Vergouwen;Rob J de Haan;Marinus Vermeulen;Yvo B W E M Roos

All patients had neurological examination and electroencephalography (EEG) complemented with magnetic resonance image (MRI) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in same cases. Among 83 patients we found the group of five (females) showing acute, stroke-like symptoms. Subarachnoid haemorrhage from a vascular malformation was diagnosed in one case. In four cases ischemical syndromes were observed mainly without strong clinical expression, with tendency to recede. In one patient the stroke was the first symptom of SLE. All these patients revealed abnormalities both in neurological examination and in neuroimaging techniques--as small, hyperintensive foci in MRI and multiple, diffused areas of decreased cerebral blood flow found in all but one cases in SPECT which seems to be the most sensitive method. In conclusions we want to stress that observed ischemic syndromes in patients with SLE were acute but of moderate intensity, with tendency to recede swiftly; transient ischemic attacks (TIA) were comparatively frequent.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28704875/,Sonographic and Doppler Sonographic Diagnosis of Neonatal Ischemic Stroke,"Children are particularly at risk for stroke in the neonatal period. 1/3 of all strokes in children occur during the perinatal period. The incidence of perinatal stroke is 1:4000. A differentiation is made between ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. Ischemic strokes are caused by arterial occlusion due to thrombosis or embolism. As a result of the nonspecific clinical symptoms in this age group, diagnosis is usually made too late. The only relatively specific symptom is focal cerebral seizure during the first week of life. Therefore, stroke should be ruled out by diagnostic imaging in the case of any seizure in the first days of life. Although the diagnostic method of choice is MRI, it is not always available. Most neonatal ischemic strokes can be detected with high-resolution duplex ultrasound. On ultrasound, ischemic stroke appears as a wedge-shaped focal increase in echogenicity in the supply region of an artery, typically the middle cerebral artery. The corresponding arterial inflow can be visualized with duplex ultrasound and measured with spectral Doppler. Doppler ultrasound can be used to differentiate between complete occlusion and severe stenosis. The success of therapeutic measures can be determined in the further course with Doppler ultrasound on the basis of the recanalization of vessels and the morphological consequences of stroke (cyst formation due to liquefactive necrosis).",,Karl-Heinz Deeg

The purposes of this article are to explore the potential for use of CT angiography and MRI and to highlight data suggestive of their usefulness in specific cardiovascular abnormalities. CONCLUSION. The evaluation of stroke requires comprehensive assessment of potential stroke mechanisms, including cardiac sources. Despite an exhaustive search for secondary causes, the precise cause of many strokes remains unknown (cryptogenic). It is well recognized, however, that some of these potential causes occur as a result of embolism from the heart or great vessels. Thus, echocardiography, in particular transesophageal echocardiography, is instrumental in a careful assessment of cardiac causes in selected individuals. Unfortunately, transesophageal echocardiography is invasive, and some patients may have relative or absolute contraindications. Cardiovascular CT angiography and MRI have growing potential compared with conventional cardiovascular echography.",CT; MRI; echocardiography; patent foramen ovale; stroke; thrombus.,Ricardo J Pagán;Pragnesh P Parikh;Patricia J Mergo;Thomas C Gerber;Rekha Mankad;William D Freeman;Brian P Shapiro

I prospectively studied the development of EI in 25 patients (13 men and 12 women, mean age 58.5 years) with single, unilateral, first-ever stroke (24 infarcts and one hemorrhage) of < or = 2 cm in diameter at 2-6 months after the stroke. The patients with major depression were excluded. The lesion location was analysed by CT and/or MRI. The results showed that 13 patients (52 %) had post-stroke EI. The presence of EI was not related to age, gender, the presence of motor or sensory dysfunction, Barthel index score or the size and the laterality of the lesion. Among the lesions involving mainly the globus pallidus, dorsally located lesions were more often associated with EI than ventrally located ones. I conclude that EI is frequent in the patients with small lenticulocapsular stroke, more often associated with the lesions affecting the dorsal than the ventral part of the globus pallidus. The findings appear to be consistent with alleged chemical neuroanatomy that serotonergic fibers are particularly abundant in the internal globus pallidus.",,Jong S Kim
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20719536/,Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) in patients with wake-up stroke,"One-quarter of ischemic strokes occur during sleep, and affected patients are excluded from thrombolytic therapy because of an unknown time of stroke onset. It has been suggested that early ischemic changes detected on computed tomography (CT) are similar in patients with acute stroke and patients who recently awoke with stroke. We compared head CT scans using the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) in patients who were likely to suffer their stroke during sleep (awoke group) and a control group of patients with stroke of known onset time. Patients were recruited from a prospectively collected acute stroke database. The awoke group was defined as all ischemic stroke patients who were ""last seen normal"" more than 4 hours ago, arrived between 4 a.m. and 10 a.m., and underwent head CT within 15 hours of the time last seen normal. The control group was randomly selected from patients who underwent head CT within 4 hours of stroke onset. The ASPECTS evaluations were performed by investigators blinded to patient group and time of onset. A modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score was available in 15 awoke patients and 46 control patients at 90 days after stroke. Twenty-eight awoke patients and 68 control patients had suitable imaging for the ASPECTS. Baseline demographic characteristics and risk factors were similar in the 2 groups. The dichotomized ASPECTS analysis (≤7 vs 8-10) showed no significant differences between the groups. ASPECTS was 8-10 in 89.3% the awoke group and 95.6% in the control group (P=.353). There was a trend toward higher 90-day mRS score (0-1) in the awoke group versus controls (73% vs 45%; P=.079). Initial ASPECTS was similar in patients with wake-up stroke and those with 4 hours of symptoms.

We investigated any effect modification by laterality on stroke patients' outcomes in recent endovascular trials. Methods- Individual patient-level data were combined in this meta-analysis of all patients included in randomized trials comparing endovascular thrombectomy predominantly done with stent retrievers with standard care in anterior circulation ischemic patients with stroke (HERMES [Highly Effective Reperfusion Using Multiple Endovascular Devices] Collaboration). We stratified the 90-day functional outcome assessed by ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin Scale according to the stroke side of patients treated with endovascular therapy versus standard care, adjusted for important prognostic variables. Results- The meta-analysis included 1737 patients (871 right hemispheric strokes and 866 left hemispheric) from 7 trials. Baseline median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores were significantly higher in left (20) versus right (16) hemispheric strokes (P<0.001). Other clinical and radiological baseline characteristics were similar. The beneficial response to endovascular therapy assessed by 90-day modified Rankin Scale shift was not modified by the side of the stroke. There were no significant differences between right and left hemispheric stroke in the 90-day functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score ≤2; 40.7% [95% CI, 37.4%-44.1%] versus 37.6% [95% CI, 37.4%-44.1%]; P=0.19), median final infarct volumes (45 versus 39.5 mL, P=0.51), nor 90-day mortality (15.1% vs 16.8%, P=0.31).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19342837/,Emergent cerebrovascular disease risk factor weighting: is transient ischemic attack an imminent threat?,"Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a neglected condition and a marker of atherothrombotic disease. Several cohort studies have demonstrated that the risk of early cerebral infarct after TIA is much higher than previously thought. Many studies have shown that the risk of stroke is high after TIA, and is on average 4-6% in the first 2 days. Up to 23% of strokes are preceded by transient ischemic attack (TIA), and there is substantial research interest in improving prevention during the short window between TIA and stroke. Nonetheless, patients with TIA are often managed without urgency. The currently available evidence suggests that the application of clinical scales is useful for the detection of patients with high risk of recurrence, and this is increased significantly when the information from neuroimaging and Doppler assessments is added. However, the limited prognostic value of these clinical variables together with the elevated risk of suffering an adverse vascular event are driving the search for new predictive factors (biological markers, neuroimaging data, ultrasound) that will help towards a better discrimination of high-risk patients. Recent studies have demonstrated that prompt evaluation and treatment of patients with TIA in a dedicated outpatient unit is associated with a lower than expected risk of subsequent stroke.",,Jaime Gállego;Roberto Muñoz;Eduardo Martínez-Vila

We examined the impact of HIV on inpatient mortality, length of acute hospital stay and complications (pneumonia, respiratory failure, sepsis and convulsions), in hospitalized strokes in Thailand. All hospitalized strokes between 1 October 2004 and 31 January 2013 were included. Data were obtained from a National Insurance Database. Characteristics and outcomes for non-HIV and HIV patients were compared and multivariate logistic and linear regression models were constructed to assess the above outcomes. Of 610 688 patients (mean age 63·4 years, 45·4% female), 0·14% (866) had HIV infection. HIV patients were younger, a higher proportion were male and had higher prevalence of anaemia (P < 0·001) compared to non-HIV patients. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension and diabetes, were more common in the non-HIV group (P < 0·001). After adjusting for age, sex, stroke type and co-morbidities, HIV infection was significantly associated with higher odds of sepsis [odds ratio (OR) 1·75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·29-2·4], and inpatient mortality (OR 2·15, 95% CI 1·8-2·56) compared to patients without HIV infection.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24894046/,Co-morbidities and mortality associated with intracranial bleeds and ischaemic stroke,"Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and acquired disability; however, there has been no comprehensive comparison of co-morbid risk factors between different stroke subtypes. The aim of this study was to compare risk factors and mortality for subdural haematoma (SDH), subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke. We compiled a database of all patients admitted with these conditions to a large teaching hospital in Birmingham, United Kingdom during the period 2000-2007 using the International Classification of Disease (ICD) 10th revision codes. Generalised linear models were constructed to calculate relative risks (RRs) associated with co-morbidities. In total, 4804 patients were admitted with diagnoses of SDH (1004), SAH (807), ischaemic stroke (2579) and haemorrhagic stroke (414). Patients with SDH were less likely to have pneumonia (0.492, 95% CI, 0.330-0.734; p < 0.001), whereas alcohol abuse (4.21, 95% CI, 2.82-6.28; p < 0.001) was more common. In SAH, ischaemic heart disease (0.56, 95% CI, 0.40-0.79; p < 0.001) was less common. As expected, a range of cardiovascular risk factors were associated with ischaemic stroke. Epilepsy was positively associated with ischaemic stroke (1.94, 95% CI, 1.36-2.76; p < 0.001), indicating a role for targeted primary prevention in patients with epilepsy. Five-year survival was lower in ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes (41% and 40% respectively, vs. 73% in SDH and 64% in SAH; p < 0.001).

Totally 1199 stroke patients, in whom the onset time was known, at 3 reference hospitals were included in this study. The effects of demographic, medical, and pathophysiological factors on the circadian pattern of an unselected series of patients with ischemic stroke were analyzed. Nine-hundred seventeen CVD patients with cerebral infarction (CI), 240 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (CH), and 42 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were identified. The greatest portion of strokes (32.5%) occurred between 03:00 and 06:00 a.m. Nearly one half of the strokes in this series occurred in the very early- to mid-morning hours. This analysis of strokes provides strong evidence with a higher risk in the early morning hours (03:00 a.m. to 06:00 a.m.), and lower risk during the night time period (21:00 p.m. to midnight). Approximately 1 of every 3 strokes (1 of 3 ischemic strokes, 1 of 6 hemorrhagic strokes, and 1 of 8 subarachnoid hemorrhages) is attributable to the early morning excess.

Nevertheless, reocclusion can occur after initial recanalization. We assessed associated factors and long-term prognosis of reocclusion after successful mechanical thrombectomy (MT). Methods- From the prospectively constructed Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne cohort, we included consecutive patients with anterior and posterior circulation strokes treated by successful MT (modified treatment in cerebral infarction 2b-3) and with 24-hour vascular imaging available. Reocclusion at this time-point was defined as new intracranial occlusion within an arterial segment recanalized at the end of MT. Through multivariate logistic regression, we investigated associated factors and 3-months outcome. In a 4:1 matched-cohort, we also assessed the role of residual thrombus or stenosis on post-recanalization angiographic images as potential predictor of reocclusion. Results- Among 473 patients with successful recanalization, 423 (89%) were included. Of these, 28 (6.6%) had 24-hour reocclusion. Preadmission statin therapy (aOR [adjusted odds ratio], 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08-0.94), intracranial internal carotid artery occlusion (aOR, 3.53; 95% CI, 1.50-8.32), number of passes (aOR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.06-1.62), transient reocclusion during MT (aOR, 8.55; 95% CI, 2.14-34.09), and atherosclerotic cause (aOR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.34-7.37) were independently associated with reocclusion. In the matched-cohort analysis, residual thrombus or stenosis was associated with reocclusion (aOR, 15.6; 95% CI, 4.6-52.8). Patients experiencing reocclusion had worse outcome (aOR, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.2-20.0). Conclusions- Reocclusion within 24-hours of successful MT was independently associated with statin pretreatment, occlusion site, more complex procedures, atherosclerotic cause, and residual thrombus or stenosis after recanalization.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23910054/,Applying antithrombotic therapies to improve outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation,"Approximately 15% to 25% or 75,000 ischemic strokes are attributed to atrial fibrillation annually within the United States. Atrial fibrillation is the most frequently diagnosed cardiac arrhythmia and affects more than 2.66 million Americans. Moreover, atrial fibrillation is associated with a 1.5 to 1.9-fold higher risk of death due to its strong correlation with thromboembolic events. Because of the attributed increased morbidity and mortality, challenges that concern identification of patients at risk for thromboembolic events from atrial fibrillation must be addressed. These challenges include compliance to performance measures, adherence to guidelines, adequate prevention and early control of co-morbidities that affect the progression of atrial fibrillation and associated risks, early initiation of treatment, and successful evaluation of associated risks of bleeding, primary or recurrent stroke, and patient awareness and compliance. This multimedia educational webcast will discuss the state of affairs with respect to antithrombotic therapies and new anticoagulants.

We analysed the rate of OAC cessation, predisposing factors to cessation and the relation to clinical outcomes in a large 'real world' cohort of AF patients over a long follow-up period. Consecutive non-valvular AF outpatients clinically stables for six months were recruited. Rates of cardiovascular events, major bleeding and mortality were recorded and related to OAC cessation. We included 1361 patients (48.7 % male; aged 76, IQR 71-81), followed-up for a median of 6.5 years. During follow-up, 244 patients suffered thrombotic events, 250 suffered from major bleeding and 551 patients died. 10 % of patients stopped OAC. After OAC withdrawal, there were 36 thromboembolic events (22 strokes), 10 major bleedings and 75 deaths. OAC cessation was independently associated with adverse cardiovascular events (HR 1.45; 95 % CI 1.01-2.08), stroke/TIA (HR 1.85; 1.17-2.94) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.30; 1.02-1.67). Independent predictors of OAC cessation were age ≥80 (HR 2.29; 1.60-3.29), previous coronary artery disease (HR 0.32; 0.15-0.71), major bleeding (HR 5.00; 3.49-7.15), heart failure (HR 2.38; 1.26-4.47), cancer (HR 5.24; 3.25-8.44) and renal impairment developed during follow-up (HR 2.70; 1.26-5.75). In conclusion, in non-valvular AF patients, cessation of OAC was independently associated with the risk of stroke, adverse cardiovascular events and mortality.

Only five patients need to be treated to prevent one stroke in three years. The time of greatest risk of stroke after the development of symptoms was in the first six months, and the incremental risk decreased out to two years. Instead the risk of stroke with asymptomatic carotid stenosis is low. Forty-five percent of strokes in patients with asymptomatic 60% to 99% stenosis are attributable to lacunes or cardioembolism. Because CE cannot prevent stroke of cardioembolic origin and is less likely to prevent stroke of lacunar origin, it is doubtful that CE can be justified for most patients with asymptomatic arteries.",,Maurizio Paciaroni;Virgilio Gallai

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19967531/,Acute stroke magnetic resonance imaging: current status and future perspective,"Cerebral stroke is one of the most frequent causes of permanent disability or death in the western world and a major burden in healthcare system. The major portion is caused by acute ischemia due to cerebral artery occlusion by a clot. The minority of strokes is related to intracerebral hemorrhage or other sources. To limit the permanent disability in ischemic stroke patients resulting from irreversible infarction of ischemic brain tissue, major efforts were made in the last decade. To extend the time window for thrombolysis, which is the only approved therapy, several imaging parameters in computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been investigated. However, the current guidelines neglect the fact that the portion of potentially salvageable ischemic tissue (penumbra) is not dependent on the time window but the individual collateral blood flow. Within the last years, the differentiation of infarct core and penumbra with MRI using diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and perfusion imaging (PI) with parameter maps was established. Current trials transform these technical advances to a redefined patient selection based on physiological parameters determined by MRI. This review article presents the current status of MRI for acute stroke imaging. A special focus is the ischemic stroke. In dependence on the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia, the basic principle and diagnostic value of different MRI sequences are illustrated. MRI techniques for imaging of the main differential diagnoses of ischemic stroke are mentioned. Moreover, perspectives of MRI for imaging-based acute stroke treatment as well as monitoring of restorative stroke therapy from recent trials are discussed.",,Stephan P Kloska;Max Wintermark;Tobias Engelhorn;Jochen B Fiebach

From March 2006 through November 2011, one hundred patients with chronic heart failure underwent implantation of a HeartMate II (HM II) LVAD (Thoratec Corp.) as a bridge to transplant (BTT; n = 65) or destination therapy (DT; n = 35). Records were reviewed to determine the prevalence and type of postimplant stroke, anatomic cerebral location of strokes, and associated morbidity and mortality. Cox multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify independent predictors of postoperative stroke. Strokes occurred in 12 patients (12.0%): four embolic and eight hemorrhagic. Median duration of support at the time of stroke was 281.0 days for embolic strokes and 380.5 days for hemorrhagic strokes (p = 0.028). Stroke patients had a significantly higher incidence of diabetes (66.7% vs. 40.9%; p = 0.024), history of preimplant stroke (16.7% vs. 4.5%; p = 0.046), and aortic cross-clamping with cardioplegic arrest during their LVAD implant (50.0% vs. 20.2%; p = 0.034) compared with patients without postoperative strokes. Mean international normalized ratio (INR) at the time of stroke was subtherapeutic in all four patients with embolic strokes (mean: 1.5 ± 0.1 IU; range 1.3-1.6 IU) and supratherapeutic in four of eight patients with hemorrhagic strokes (mean: 3.2 ± 2.2 IU, range: 1.4-7.0 IU; p = 0.024). There was a 25.0% 30 day mortality after stroke. Diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 6.36; p = 0.029), aortic cross-clamping with cardioplegic arrest (OR 4.75; p = 0.025), duration of LVAD support (OR 1.00; p = 0.008), and INR (OR 4.42; p = 0.020) were independent predictors of stroke in multivariate analysis with a trend toward significance for history of stroke (OR 6.25; p = 0.075). Stroke represented an important source of morbidity and mortality for patients on HM II LVAD support. As long-term device therapy continues to gain popularity for both BTT and DT, a better understanding of the predictors of stroke, more strict control of postoperative anticoagulation, and the establishment of a risk stratification model may aid in minimizing its occurrence.",,Jeffrey A Morgan;Robert J Brewer;Hassan W Nemeh;Brent Gerlach;David E Lanfear;Celeste T Williams;Gaetano Paone

Its diagnosis is based on questioning of the patient or those around him and on clinical examination. Stroke requires rapid investigation by imagery of the brain and intra- and extracranial vessels. Currently these investigations associate CT scan of the brain (which differentiates infarcts and haemorrhage) and cervical and intracranial ultrasound examination, or angiography if vascular malformation is suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging, when available for emergency use, is greatly superior in its earlier detection of signal abnormalities, its diagnostic precision and visualisation of the vessels. Recent clinical trials have shown the effectiveness of stroke management in specialised units (30% reduction in the number of deaths or institutionalised patients) and of very early intravenous administration of rt-PA (within less than 3 hours).

Embolism may come from a parietal lesion of a large artery in the neck (traumatic dissections), from a cryptic cardiopathy, from a venous thrombosis associated with a right-left shunt. Among pathologies of endocranial arteries, the most frequent is the acute, postviral arteriopathy of the sus-clinoïd carotid, which evolves toward stabilisation or regression. Insidious obstructive arteriopathies of the Willis circle, including development of a transparenchymal suppletive circulation (Moya-Moya disease), cumulate chronic circulatory insufficiency and repetitive strokes. Inflammatory multifocal cerebral arteriopathies mainly involve mean and small arteries. Most of them are secondary to a multisystemic disease, but some are primary. The basic investigation is anatomical and begins with MRI. Emergency conventional cerebral angiography is discussed when heparinotherapy is difficult to decide (evolutive thrombosis), or when an endovascular intervention appears possible (anoeuvrism). Secondarily, conventional angiography is indicated in any chronic situation where a precise anatomical follow-up is necessary.

Imbalance between continuous production of reactive oxygen forms and their elimination due to enzymatic and non-enzymatic neutralization reactions as well as effects of exogenous antioxidants is defined as oxidative stress. Recent studies demonstrated a significant role of inflammatory processes and oxidative stress in the pathomechanism of cerebral stroke. Increased production of free radicals was observed in both the ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes and oxidative stress was shown to be one of the causative mechanisms of tissue damage in these diseases. This was confirmed by numerous studies assessing the concentration of oxidative stress biomarkers and levels of plasma antioxidants (enzymatic and non-enzymatic).

Our objective was to examine the effect of preadmission antithrombotic therapy on stroke severity and outcome in patients with AF within a large comprehensive nationwide stroke survey. The data from consecutive patients with AF admitted with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack during a 2-month period were collected. The patients were categorized into 4 groups according to the use of preadmission antithrombotic therapy: no antithrombotic therapy, antiplatelet therapy, warfarin with an admission international normalized ratio (INR) <2 and INR of > or = 2. Of 1,938 patients presenting with acute brain ischemia, 329 (17%) had AF. The age-adjusted rate of more severe stroke (baseline National Institutes of Health stroke scale score >5) stratified by antithrombotic therapy use was 70% for no antithrombotic therapy use, 55% for antiplatelet therapy use, 59% for warfarin with an INR <2, and 38% for warfarin with an INR of > or = 2 (p = 0.01). Compared to warfarin therapy with an admission INR of > or = 2, the adjusted odds ratio for more severe strokes was 4.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7 to 10.0) for no antithrombotic therapy, 2.2 (95% CI 1.0 to 9.4) for antiplatelet therapy, and 2.7 (95% CI 1.1 to 6.7) for warfarin therapy with an INR of <2. Similarly, graded associations of antithrombotic medication were observed with severe disability (modified Rankin Scale score >3) or death at discharge, with corresponding adjusted odds ratios of 4.1 (95% CI 1.8 to 9.9), 2.1 (95% CI 1.0 to 4.6), and 1.5 (95% CI 0.6 to 3.5), and 1-year mortality, with corresponding adjusted ORs of 2.4 (95% CI 0.9 to 6.7), 1.9 (95% CI 0.8 to 5.0), and 2.2 (95% CI 0.8 to 6.2).

We studied whether SRH predicts new stroke in older people who have never had a stroke, or a recurrence in those with a prior history of stroke.",,Nahal Mavaddat;Rianne van der Linde;Richard Parker;George Savva;Ann Louise Kinmonth;Carol Brayne;Jonathan Mant
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31609791/,"Comparison of Neurologic Event Rates Among HeartMate II, HeartMate 3, and HVAD","Strokes remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with ventricular assist devices (VADs). Varying study populations, event definitions, and reporting methods make direct comparison of neurologic event risk across clinical trials and registries challenging. We aim to highlight important differences among major VAD studies and standardize rates of neurologic events to facilitate a comprehensive and objective comparison. We systematically identified and analyzed key clinical trials and registries evaluating the HeartMate II (HMII), HeartMate 3 (HM3), and HVAD devices. Reported neurologic events were nonexclusively categorized into ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, disabling stroke, fatal stroke, and other neurologic events per the studies' definitions. Event rates were standardized to events per patient-year (EPPY) and freedom from event formats. Seven key clinical trials and registries were included in our analysis. There is significant variation and overlap in neurologic event rates for the three VAD platforms across clinical trials (all neurologic events [EPPY]: HM3 0.17-0.21; HMII 0.19-0.26; HVAD 0.16-0.28). None performs consistently better for all types of neurologic events. Furthermore, stroke rates among VAD trials correlated with baseline stroke risk factors including ischemic etiology, history of atrial fibrillation, and history of prior stroke.",,Song Li;Jennifer A Beckman;Richard Cheng;Chinwe Ibeh;Claire J Creutzfeldt;Jason Bjelkengren;Joni Herrington;April Stempien-Otero;Shin Lin;Wayne C Levy;Daniel Fishbein;Kevin J Koomalsingh;Daniel Zimpfer;Mark S Slaughter;Alberto Aliseda;David Tirschwell;Claudius Mahr
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23188424/,Combined two-photon laser-scanning microscopy and spectral microCT X-ray imaging to characterize the cellular signature and evolution of microstroke foci,"Occlusive brain ischemia and micro-strokes are the most frequent brain pathologies, particularly in older patients and a major cause of dementia. Currently, we are missing appropriate methodology to study micro-strokes in experimental animals. In vivo two-photon laser-scanning microscopy (2P-LSM) and transgenic mouse models expressing cell type specific reporters have been used to examine ischemia-related insults, e.g. perturbations of neuronal process morphology and local blood flow in the MCAO - middle cerebral artery occlusion-model. Glia and pericytes can be visualized by selective fluorescent protein expression, e.g. astrocytes by their cyan-fluorescent ECFP, pericytes by red-fluorescent tdtomato and microglia by green fluorescent EGFP expression. In these mice, the breakdown of the blood brain barrier and the immediate as well as long-term cellular responses can be monitored. A new prototype of microCT incorporating a fast X-ray XPAD3 camera has been recently set up to allow cerebral angiography at high sampling rate. Preliminary data indicate that it is useful to monitor blood perfusion disturbance (i.e. lateralization) in the brain of tumor-bearing mice following retro-orbital injection of iodinated contrast agent. We expect this technology to be adequate to assess in real time the impact of acute stroke models on brain blood perfusion. By localizing perfusion anomalies, we will evaluate the extent of non-perfused areas and correlate these observations with subsequent behavioral deficits, and with local changes in myelin content in white matter tracks. The spectral properties of the XPAD3 detector moreover allow for the simultaneous identification and localization of several contrast agents opening the way to whole body multicolor imaging of vessels and inflammatory cells in the context of microstrokes.",,F Kirchhoff;F Debarbieux;Carine Kronland-Martinet;G R Cojocaru;A Popa-Wagner

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15584613/,[Treatment in the primary prevention of stroke--still not fully used option],"Several studies have shown that pharmacological treatment of systolic-diastolic hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension in elderly persons would result in several years in a significant decrease (more than 40%) of stroke. Occurrence of strokes decreased in the Czech Republic in years 1985 till 2002 by more than 40%, which represents about two thirds of the decrease observed in the USA. Nevertheless, we cannot be satisfied with the treatment of hypertension in the Czech Republic because only 18% of patients are effectively treated for the hypertension, with BP < 140/90 mm Hg. Not well controlled hypertension results namely from the minimal use of the combination treatment. From the point of prognosis for the hypertensive patients older than 50 years, the level of systolic pressure is more important than the diastolic pressure. The risk of development of the stroke rises from the level of systolic blood pressure 115 mmHg almost linearly. Calcium channel blockers or diuretics represent the most appropriate therapy of the isolated systolic hypertension of elderly patients. The risk of stroke is higher also in persons with elevated blood pressure in the morning. That is why in elderly patients the use of drugs effectively controlling blood pressure during 24 hours is necessary. Recent studies (HOPE study, PROGRESS study) have demonstrated that the reduction of blood pressure decreases the occurrence of stroke not only in hypertensive patients, but also in the normotensive persons during the primary and secondary prevention. Review data show that 27% of ischemic strokes and 57% of hemorhagic strokes, which happened in the ""treated"" hypertensive patients, are due to not well controlled hypertension. Missing treatment of hypertension is responsible for 22.8% of strokes in men and 25.4% in women. The given data show a big reserve for the possibility to decrease further the stroke incidence in the population.",,J Widimský

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31412756/,Infection During Delivery Hospitalization and Risk of Readmission for Postpartum Stroke,"Background and Purpose- Most cases of pregnancy-related ischemic stroke (IS) and hemorrhagic stroke (HS) occur postpartum. Infections have been identified as a trigger for strokes in young people and have been associated with strokes during delivery hospitalizations, but a temporal relationship has been difficult to establish. We hypothesized that infections diagnosed during a delivery admission would be associated with an increased risk of readmission for postpartum stroke. Methods- We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Readmissions Database from 2010 to 2014. Using weighted survey design Poisson regression analysis, we calculated adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95% CI for the association between infection during delivery admission and 30-day postpartum readmission for IS or HS. Results- Out of 17.2 million delivery admissions during the study period, 2128 were readmitted within 30 days for a stroke of any type. There were 1189 HS (intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage) and 720 IS, and the remainder unspecified pregnancy-related stroke. Adjusting for age and comorbidities, women with delivery infections were at higher risk of readmission for postpartum stroke of any type (aRR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.01-1.41). Women with infections had higher risk of readmission for postpartum IS (aRR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.37-2.22), but not for postpartum HS (aRR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.75-1.23). The effect of infection on 30-day IS readmission was larger in women without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (aRR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.55-2.69 in women without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy versus aRR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.9-2.38 in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, P value for interaction=0.09). Conclusions- Infection during delivery hospitalization was associated with increased risk of readmission for IS, but not HS, within 30 days postpartum, particularly in women without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Infection may play a role in triggering postpartum IS even in the absence of other risk factors.",hospitalization; infection; postpartum period; pregnancy; stroke; women.,Eliza C Miller;Timothy Wen;Mitchell S V Elkind;Alexander M Friedman;Amelia K Boehme
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11092104/,Cost-effectiveness of stroke prevention,"Stroke is a preventable disease and there are several interventions that might have an important role in reducing the burden of disease. Economic appraisal of these different interventions is essential as resources are scarce and it is logical to attempt to obtain the greatest reduction in disease for the lowest cost. Anticoagulation for non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation is highly effective, but is expensive and cost-effectiveness analyses show that use of aspirin alone would prevent almost as many strokes at much lower cost. Antiplatelet drugs are both effective and inexpensive and their use in secondary prevention would potentially save the NHS about 900 Pounds per life year gained. Carotid endarterectomy and the associated screening costs are poor value for money but recent attempts to use predictive models to determine which patients will benefit from surgery may improve its cost-effectiveness. Current evidence is dominated by pharmacological interventions and much less good evidence is available for life-style modifications such as dietary change and physical exercise. Modification of major cardiovascular risk factors (blood cholesterol, high blood pressure and smoking) is very cost-effective but needs to be better targeted if potential health gain is to be realised.",,S Ebrahim

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23312661/,Stroke,"Stroke is a major cause of death and disability. International and national guidelines are available to help clinicians provide evidence-based care for stroke prevention, acute treatment, and rehabilitation. Stroke is a medical emergency and rapid assessment is needed to establish the diagnosis, identify the underlying cause, provide acute treatment, and prevent complications. Although stroke is a clinical diagnosis based upon a history of sudden onset of neurological symptoms, which include unilateral weakness or sensory loss, dysphasia, hemianopia, inattention, and reduced coordination, brain imaging with CT or MRI scan is needed to distinguish cerebral infarction from primary intracerebral haemorrhage. Stroke units are the cornerstones of stroke care and should be available to all stroke patients throughout their inpatient stay. Multidisciplinary stroke care should address the physical, psychological, and social consequences of stroke and consider the needs of both patients and carers. Good communication with patients and carers and between members of the multidisciplinary team is fundamental to quality care. Ongoing assessment and treatment may be needed for: dysphagia; nutrition and hydration; continence and skin care; mobility and upper limb function; comprehension and communication; concentration and memory; spatial awareness and inattention; mood; pain and spasticity. Patients and carers should be fully informed about the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and available care. Discharge requires careful planning and consultation. Early supported discharge can improve outcome for carefully selected patients. It is important to recognize and address the long-term needs in order to maximize choice, independence, and wellbeing. Targeted rehabilitation to address issues such as mobility and leisure may be effective.",,Helen Rodgers

Aphasia, neglect and anosognosia were also reported to occur after thalamic lesions, in the absence of cortical pathology. However, considerable controversy exists as to the pathogenetic mechanisms, and incidence of cognitive abnormalities following thalamic lesions. We present a series of sixteen consecutive stroke patients with thalamic stroke (n=12) or hemorrhage (n=4), admitted to a university based neurology department. Dysphasia was observed in seven of eight patients with left thalamic strokes (five in the territory of the tuberothalamic artery, two inferior-lateral thalamic lesions and one in the area supplied by the anterior choroidal artery). Neglect and anosognosia appeared in five of eight patients with right side thalamic insults (two each in the territories of the tuberothalamic and thalamogeniculate arteries and one in the area supplied by the posterior choroidal artery).

We designed this study to test whether parental AF is a risk factor for stroke in young adults. Methods- Population-based cohort study using linked administrative databases from April 1, 1972 to March 31, 2016 in Manitoba, Canada for 325 333 offspring (age ≥18 years) with at least 1 linked parent (total 582 195 parents). We examined the association between parental history of AF and stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in the offspring using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Results- Offspring median age at study entry was 18 years. During 5.533 million person-years of follow-up (mean 17 years), 8678 offspring had an incident stroke or TIA (5.2% of the 24 583 offspring with a parental history of AF compared with 2.5% of the 300 750 offspring with no parental history of AF), and 1430 were diagnosed with AF (1.9% versus 0.3%). Incidence rates for stroke/TIA were higher in offspring with a parental history of AF (195.0 versus 156.6 per 100 000 person-years). Parental AF was associated with elevated risk in offspring of stroke/TIA (hazard ratio 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.18) or AF (hazard ratio 1.75; 95% CI, 1.55-1.97) and a higher frequency of other cardiovascular risk factors. After adjusting for demographics, region of residence, socioeconomic status, and other stroke risk factors in offspring, parental AF was associated with AF in their offspring in young adulthood (adjusted hazard ratio 1.61; 95% CI, 1.43-1.82); the association of parental AF with offspring stroke/TIA was attenuated (adjusted hazard ratio 1.05; 95% CI, 0.99-1.12) after adjusting for the other cardiovascular risk factors.

Results from a community-based incidence study in northern Sweden,"Several studies have shown a relationship between low socioeconomic status, age and stroke mortality. However, there is lack of similar studies in relation to stroke incidence. All cases of first-ever stroke occurring in a population aged 35-85 years from the city of Umeå were collected from hospital-based registers during a 2-year study period (2000-2002), from death certificates and also from nursing homes during a 6-month period. The WHO definition of stroke was used. Register data served to analyze educational level. A total of 457 first-ever strokes (244 women and 213 men) were registered, corresponding to an overall annual incidence rate of first-ever stroke of 413.4 per 100,000. The incidence of first-ever stroke was significantly higher among low-educated compared to high-educated men and women. The highest stroke incidence was found among low-educated women aged 75-85 years. The educational-related differences in stroke incidence persisted in the oldest age group (75-85 years), also after controlling for sex and age.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22863273/,Haemorrhagic strokes in pregnancy and puerperium,"There is an increased risk of strokes in pregnancy and puerperium. Intracranial haemorrhage is the rarer of the two stroke subtypes but carries a greater morbidity and mortality for both the mother and the child. This review highlights the causes of pregnancy-related intracranial haemorrhage and its management. The incidence varies from region to region with the highest being reported from China and Taiwan. Majority of these haemorrhages are secondary to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy with smaller proportions related to aneurysm and arteriovenous malformation rupture. A small but important contributor is cortical venous thrombosis which, although predominantly gives rise to ischaemic lesions, may lead to parenchymal haemorrhages as well. Presentation is usually with headaches or seizures, with or without focal deficits. Diagnosis requires brain imaging with computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, and the necessity of investigation when this diagnosis is suspected supersedes the small risk of fetal malformation. Management follows the general management principles for intracranial haemorrhage management. Blood pressures need to be strictly monitored and medicines used for controlling them may differ slightly due to teratogenic effects. For preeclampsia, early but safe delivery is the best treatment. For cortical venous thrombosis, low-molecular-weight heparin is the preferred agent. Aneurysms and vascular malformations need to be definitively treated to prevent re-bleed and this can be achieved through surgical or endovascular procedures. The timing of surgery depends on neurosurgical considerations. However, the timing and mode of delivery are governed by obstetric factors.

Aim We report the first Australasian stroke incidence study in a rural population. Methods The authors applied the principle of complete ascertainment, used the WHO standard definition of stroke and classified ischemic stroke by the TOAST criteria. Data were collected from five rural centers defined by postcode of residence, over a 2-year period with 12 months of follow up of all cases. Results There were 217 strokes in 215 individuals in a population of 96,036 people, over 2 years, giving a crude attack rate of 113 per 100,000 per year. The 181 first-ever strokes (83% of total), standardized to the WHO world population, occurred at a rate of 50/100,000 (95% CI: 43-58). The 28-day fatality for first-ever strokes was 24% (95% CI: 18-31) and 77% (95% CI: 71-83) were classified as ischemic (140/181), 15% (95% CI: 10-21) intracerebral hemorrhage, 3% (95% CI: 1-6) due to subarachnoid hemorrhage and 5% (95% CI: 2-9) were unknown. A high proportion of first-ever ischemic strokes (44%) were cardioembolic, mostly (77%) due to atrial arrhythmias. Of the 38 with known atrial arrhythmias prior to stroke, only six (16%) were therapeutically anticoagulated. Conclusions This rural companion study of a recent Australian urban stroke incidence study confirms the downward trend of stroke incidence in Australia, and reiterates that inadequate anticoagulation of atrial arrhythmia remains a preventable cause of ischemic stroke.",Stroke; anticoagulation; atrial fibrillation; epidemiology; ischemic stroke; rural health.,Jonathan Newbury;Tim Kleinig;James Leyden;Hisatomi Arima;Sally Castle;Jennifer Cranefield;Tracey Paterson;Jim Jannes;Maria Crotty;Craig S Anderson

In a systematic fashion, these trials have significantly advanced the care of children with SCA. In the absence of an RCT, clinicians are often compelled to make decisions at the bedside, based on experience, observational studies, and principles of hematology. We will provide an initial example that describes how a team-based, learning collaborative developed a multisite standard care protocol with a low budget (<$10 000 per year) to overcome the intrinsic limitations of advancing the care of neurologic complications in sickle cell disease (SCD). The critical components of this approach include: (1) regular meetings with the multidisciplinary team from multiple sites; (2) consensus regarding the best evidence-based neurologic management in multiple SCD centers; (3) an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol based on consensus standard care; (4) minimizing and ensuring accurate data collection; and most importantly, (5) a spirit of collaboration to improve the care of individuals with SCD. Four common neurologic problems and strategies for management in children and adults with SCD will be discussed: (1) secondary stroke prevention in high-income countries; (2) primary stroke prevention in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); (3) poor academic performance in students; and (4) cognitive disability in adults.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31748020/,Delivery of High Mobility Group Box-1 siRNA Using Brain-Targeting Exosomes for Ischemic Stroke Therapy,"Ischemic strokes are caused by decreased blood flow into the brain, due to narrowed cerebral arteries. In the ischemic brain, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is released into extracellular spaces and induces inflammatory reactions. In this study, HMGB1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) was delivered into ischemic brains by intravenous administration using rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) peptide-decorated exosomes. A fusion protein of RVG and Lamp2b was expressed in 293T cells. Since Lamp2b is an exosome membrane-integral protein, RVG-Lamp2b is integrated into the exosomes, producing RVG-decorated exosomes (RVG-Exo). HMGB1-siRNA was loaded into RVG-Exo and unmodified exosomes (Unmod-Exo) by electroporation. The exosomes were homogenous with a size of less than 50 nm and a negative surface charge. In vitro delivery assays showed that RVG-Exo showed higher efficiency to Neuro2A cells than Unmod-Exo. Also, HMGB1 levels were reduced more effectively by RVG-Exo/HMGB1-siRNA. In vivo delivery efficiency and therapeutic effects of RVG-Exo/HMGB1-siRNA were evaluated in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. RVG-Exo/HMGB1-siRNA, Unmod-Exo/HMGB1-siRNA, and PEI25k/HMGB1-siRNA were administrated into the MCAO model intravenously through the tail vein. The results showed that HMGB1, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and apoptosis levels in the brain were reduced in the RVG-Exo/HMGB1-siRNA group more efficiently than the other groups. In addition, the infarct size was decreased in the RVG-Exo/HMGB1 group more effectively than the other groups. These results suggest that RVG-Exo with HMGB1-siRNA may have potential as a therapeutic system for the treatment of ischemic strokes.",,Minkyung Kim;Gyeungyun Kim;Do Won Hwang;Minhyung Lee

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17525141/,Moderate hyperglycaemia is associated with favourable outcome in acute lacunar stroke,"Hyperglycaemia in acute ischaemic stroke is traditionally associated with a worsened outcome. However, it is unclear whether the impact of hyperglycaemia on stroke outcome is similar in lacunar and non-lacunar infarctions. The relation between serum glucose measured within 6 h after stroke onset and functional outcome was investigated in 1375 ischaemic stroke patients who had been included in two placebo-controlled trials with lubeluzole. The endpoint was a favourable outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score < or =2 at 3 months. Classification into lacunar (n = 168) and non-lacunar (n = 1207) strokes was based on clinical criteria according to the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project and findings on brain CT scan. Hyperglycaemia was defined as blood glucose >8 mmol/l. A possible concentration-dependent effect of glucose on outcome was investigated in both lacunar and non-lacunar stroke. Multivariate analysis showed that hyperglycaemia was associated with decreased odds of a favourable outcome in non-lacunar stroke (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.41-0.88, P = 0.009), but with increased odds of a favourable outcome in lacunar stroke (multivariate OR for glucose >8 mmol/l: 2.70; 95% CI 1.01-7.13, P = 0.048). In non-lacunar stroke, there appeared to be a concentration-effect relation, as the odds of favourable outcome gradually decreased with increasing glucose levels. In lacunar stroke, an association with favourable outcome was observed with glucose levels >8 mmol/l, but this beneficial effect diminished with more severe hyperglycaemia >12 mmol/l. In conclusion, hyperglycaemia has a detrimental effect in non-lacunar stroke, but moderate hyperglycaemia may be beneficial in lacunar stroke.",,Maarten Uyttenboogaart;Marcus W Koch;Roy E Stewart;Patrick C Vroomen;Gert-Jan Luijckx;Jacques De Keyser

In this study, we evaluated the characteristics of seizures in stroke patients. There were 2267 patients with a first-ever stroke, and after excluding 387 patients, 1880 were available for analysis. Of these 1880 patients, we evaluated 200 patients with seizures and 400 patients without seizures. We investigated the seizures according to age, gender, stroke type, the aetiology of ischaemic stroke and the localisation of the lesion. The seizures were classified as early onset and late onset and the seizure type as partial, generalised or secondarily generalised. Seizures occurred in 200 (10.6%) of 1880 strokes. The number of patients with seizures were 138 (10.6%) in ischaemic stroke group and 62 (10.7%) in haemorrhagic stroke group. Patients with ischaemic strokes had 41 embolic (29.7%) and 97 thrombotic (70.3%) origin, and these were not statistically significant in comparison with controls. Cortical involvement for the development of seizures was the most important risk factor (odds ratios = 4.25, p < 0.01). It was concluded that embolic strokes, being younger than 65 years old, and cortical localisation of stroke were important risks for developing seizures.",,H Misirli;A Ozge;G Somay;N Erdoğan;H Erkal;N Y Erenoğlu

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31709500/,"Stroke Severity, and Not Cerebral Infarct Location, Increases the Risk of Infection","Infection is a leading cause of death in patients with stroke; however, the impact of cerebral infarct size or location on infectious outcome is unclear. To examine the effect of infarct size on post-stroke infection, we utilised the intraluminal middle-cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model of ischemic stroke and adjusted the duration of arterial occlusion. At 1 day following stroke onset, the proportion of mice with infection was significantly greater in mice that had larger infarct sizes. Additionally, the presence of lung infection in these mice with severe strokes extended past 2 days, suggestive of long-term immune impairment. At the acute phase, our data demonstrated an inverse relationship between infarct volume and the number of circulating leukocytes, indicating the elevated risk of infection in more severe stroke is associated with reduced cellularity in peripheral blood, owing predominately to markedly decreased lymphocyte numbers. In addition, the stroke-induced reduction of lymphocyte-to-neutrophil ratio was also evident in the lung of all post-stroke animals. To investigate the effect of infarct location on post-stroke infection, we additionally performed a photothrombotic (PT) model of stroke and using an innovative systematic approach of analysis, we found the location of cerebral infarct does not impact on the susceptibility of post-stroke infection, confirming the greater role of infarct volume over infarct location in the susceptibility to infection. Our experimental findings were validated in a clinical setting and reinforced that stroke severity, and not infarct location, influences the risk of infection after stroke.",Infarct location; Infarct volume; Infection; Stroke.,Raymond Shim;Shu Wen Wen;Brooke J Wanrooy;Michelle Rank;Tharani Thirugnanachandran;Luke Ho;Tara Sepehrizadeh;Michael de Veer;Velandai K Srikanth;Henry Ma;Thanh G Phan;Christopher G Sobey;Connie H Y Wong

The women were randomized to receive either 100 mg of aspirin or a placebo tablet every other day; they were also randomized to take 600 IU of vitamin E or a placebo capsule on the intervening days. No statistically significant differences were seen between the aspirin and placebo groups in the primary cardiovascular end point, which was the combined number of nonfatal MIs, nonfatal strokes, and cardiovascular deaths. Analysis of secondary cardiovascular end points revealed that aspirin use was associated with no significant effect on the number of total MIs, fatal MIs, and nonfatal MIs, and a nonsignificant decrease in cardiovascular mortality.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26806700/,"Stroke injury, cognitive impairment and vascular dementia","The global burden of ischaemic strokes is almost 4-fold greater than haemorrhagic strokes. Current evidence suggests that 25-30% of ischaemic stroke survivors develop immediate or delayed vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) or vascular dementia (VaD). Dementia after stroke injury may encompass all types of cognitive disorders. States of cognitive dysfunction before the index stroke are described under the umbrella of pre-stroke dementia, which may entail vascular changes as well as insidious neurodegenerative processes. Risk factors for cognitive impairment and dementia after stroke are multifactorial including older age, family history, genetic variants, low educational status, vascular comorbidities, prior transient ischaemic attack or recurrent stroke and depressive illness. Neuroimaging determinants of dementia after stroke comprise silent brain infarcts, white matter changes, lacunar infarcts and medial temporal lobe atrophy. Until recently, the neuropathology of dementia after stroke was poorly defined. Most of post-stroke dementia is consistent with VaD involving multiple substrates. Microinfarction, microvascular changes related to blood-brain barrier damage, focal neuronal atrophy and low burden of co-existing neurodegenerative pathology appear key substrates of dementia after stroke injury. The elucidation of mechanisms of dementia after stroke injury will enable establishment of effective strategy for symptomatic relief and prevention. Controlling vascular disease risk factors is essential to reduce the burden of cognitive dysfunction after stroke.

The trials used a variety of imaging modalities and combinations of treatment approaches, including the mandatory use of intravenous thrombolysis before the initiation of endovascular therapy. All five trials provided strong evidence to support the use of thrombectomy that is initiated within 6 h of stroke onset, prompting worldwide changes in the guidelines for management of acute stroke by endovascular treatment. The benefits of endovascular therapy were observed irrespective of a patient's age, their NIH Stroke Scale score, or whether they received intravenous thrombolysis. In this article, we review the main findings of these recent trials, focusing on key aspects of their designs, and discuss their impact on the future management of patients with acute stroke that results from large-vessel occlusion. We discuss the values of noncontrast CT ASPECTS, perfusion imaging and angiography for selecting patients to receive endovascular interventions.

The study, based on the population-based data of the Dijon register of stroke (France), involved 3287 patients with a cerebrovascular event during the Years 1985-1998. The seasonal distribution pointed out a summer decrease for all stroke subtypes. The cerebrovascular risk was the highest in autumn for small artery atheroma infarcts and for cerebral infarcts and, among these later, for cardioembolic infarcts and large artery atheroma infarcts, as well as for subarachnoid hemorrhages and for the total number of strokes. It was followed by spring (total number of strokes, small artery atheroma infarcts, cerebral infarcts) and/or winter (subarachnoid hemorrhages, cerebral infarcts, cardioembolic infarcts and large artery atheroma infarcts). For intracerebral hemorrhages, the risk peaked in spring and secondly in autumn. But the difference from one season to another was significant only for total number of strokes, cerebral infarcts and, among the later, for cardioembolic infarcts and large artery atheroma infarcts. As regards the Monthly distribution, the difference between Months was significant only for the total number of strokes and cerebral infarcts, with a minimum from July to September and a maximum in October for the later. Correlations with meteorological data were found for the total number of strokes, cerebral infarcts, cardioembolic infarcts, large artery atheroma infarcts and small artery atheroma infarcts. They showed an influence of temperature and relative humidity of the day of stroke or of the one to five days before. Correlations with wind speed, duration of sunshine or snow, even if less frequent, could also be found. Such results sometimes differ from those of some earlier studies, for which the climate and the risk factors were not the same, showing that regional epidemiological studies are necessary in order to determine the relations between seasons, meteorological factors and strokes.",,K Laaidi;D Minier;G-V Osseby;G Couvreur;J-P Besancenot;T Moreau;M Giroud

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22637544/,Is misery perfusion still a predictor of stroke in symptomatic major cerebral artery disease?,"Studies in the 1990s demonstrated that misery perfusion is a predictor of subsequent stroke in medically treated patients with symptomatic major cerebral artery disease. A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated no benefit of bypass surgery for such patients. In this light, outcome in patients with misery perfusion has regained interest. The purpose of this study was to determine whether misery perfusion is still a predictor of subsequent stroke despite recent improvements in medical treatment for secondary prevention of stroke, and if so, whether the predictive value of misery perfusion has changed in recent years. We prospectively studied 165 non-disabled patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery occlusive diseases who underwent positron emission tomography from 1999 to 2008. Misery perfusion was defined as decreased cerebral blood flow, increased oxygen extraction fraction and decreased ratio of cerebral blood flow to blood volume in the hemisphere supplied by the diseased artery. All patients were followed up for 2 years until stroke recurrence or death. Bypass surgery was performed in 19 of 35 patients with and 16 of 130 patients without misery perfusion. The 2-year incidence of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke was six and four patients with and without misery perfusion, including two and one after surgery, respectively (P < 0.002). Total strokes occurred in nine patients with misery perfusion and 12 patients without (P < 0.01). The relative risk conferred by misery perfusion in whole sample was 6.3 (95% confidence interval 1.7-22.4, P < 0.005) for ipsilateral ischaemic stroke and 3.5 (95% confidence interval 1.4-8.9, P < 0.01) for all strokes, while the respective values in medically treated patients were 12.6 (95% confidence interval 2.7-57.8, P < 0.005) and 4.7 (95% confidence interval 1.3-16.3, P < 0.02). The all-stroke incidence in patients entering the study from 2004 to 2008 (4/72) was significantly lower than in those entering from 1999 to 2003 (17/93; P < 0.02), although the prevalence of misery perfusion or bypass surgery did not differ. Between these periods, patients without misery perfusion demonstrated a decrease in stroke rate (from 16.2% to 0%), but patients with misery perfusion did not (26.3 and 25.0%). In symptomatic major cerebral artery disease, misery perfusion remains a predictor of subsequent stroke, although the recurrence rate was lower than the previous study. In patients without misery perfusion, the risk of stroke was reduced over time. Thus, identification and stricter management of patients with misery perfusion are essential to further improve prognosis.",,Hiroshi Yamauchi;Tatsuya Higashi;Shinya Kagawa;Ryuichi Nishii;Takashi Kudo;Kanji Sugimoto;Hidehiko Okazawa;Hidenao Fukuyama
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16252611/,"Stroke prevention, blood cholesterol and statins","Statins have a good overall safety profile to date, with no increase in haemorrhagic stroke or cancer. They have favourable effects in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in high-risk young as well as elderly populations. Statins reduce the incidence of stroke in high-risk populations (mainly CHD patients, diabetics and hypertensives) even with a normal baseline blood cholesterol level, which argues for a global cardiovascular risk-based treatment strategy. As for CHD, stroke reduction was mainly observed in studies with large between-group LDL cholesterol difference. In patients with prior strokes, statins reduce the incidence of coronary events, but it is not yet proven that they actually reduce the incidence of recurrent strokes in secondary prevention. From a practical point of view, since there was a favourable treatment effect overall in stroke and TIA patients in HPS, it seems reasonable to treat stroke patients with a statin and total cholesterol >135 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/dL). On-going research is aiming to refine patient selection. As anticipated by current US recommendations, patients who are likely to benefit most are those with carotid atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, previous coronary heart disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, or cigarette smoking and LDL cholesterol > 100 mg/dL.",,Pierre Amarenco;Philippa C Lavallée;Julien Labreuche;Pierre-Jean Touboul

Analysis revealed that both groups of patients presented with an impaired recognition of emotional faces. However, patients with PSRH were able to identify facial expressions better than participants with ASRH. In comparison to participants sustaining PSRH, patients with ASRH were particularly impaired on recognizing faces of negative valence. Thus, our results suggest that anterior parts of the RH seem to play an important role in the recognition of emotional facial expressions.",,Michal Harciarek;Kenneth M Heilman

For acute ischaemic stroke, the addition of endovascular thrombectomy of proximal large artery occlusion to intravenous alteplase increases functional independence for a further fifth of patients. The benefits of aspirin in preventing early recurrent ischaemic stroke are greater than previously recognised. Other strategies to prevent recurrent stroke now include direct oral anticoagulants as an alternative to warfarin for atrial fibrillation, and carotid stenting as an alternative to endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis. For acute intracerebral haemorrhage, trials are ongoing to assess the effectiveness of acute blood pressure lowering, haemostatic therapy, minimally invasive surgery, anti-inflammation therapy, and neuroprotection methods. Pharmacological and stem-cell therapies promise to facilitate brain regeneration, rehabilitation, and functional recovery.

The 90-day risk of stroke after a transient ischemic attack has been estimated to be approximately 10 percent, with one half of strokes occurring within the first two days of the attack. The 90-day stroke risk is even higher when a transient ischemic attack results from internal carotid artery stenosis. Most patients reporting symptoms of transient ischemic attack should be sent to an emergency department. Patients who arrive at the emergency department within 180 minutes of symptom onset should undergo an expedited history and physical examination, as well as selected laboratory tests, to determine if they are candidates for thrombolytic therapy. Initial testing should include complete blood count with platelet count, prothrombin time, International Normalized Ratio, partial thromboplastin time, and electrolyte and glucose levels.

The treatment of symptomatic patients has not changed much during the last twenty years, since the publication of the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET). However, in contrast, the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) and the Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (ACST) failed to get the same acceptance among the multidisciplinary group treating CAS.The prevalence of asymptomatic 60-99% carotid artery stenosis among the general population is about 1%. Neither ACAS nor ACST showed that stenosis severity was associated with increasing stroke risk. The 'realpolitik' is that mass interventions in asymptomatic patients will probably only ever prevent about 1% of all strokes. This is even truer regarding patients scheduLed for major operation, in which the incidence of stroke is less than 1%. Moreover the current evidence in the literature suggests that the best medicaL treatment (BMT) results in 0.5% strokes per year, better than resuLts which can be offered by surgery.

This case report details two patients who experienced smell and taste dysfunction following minor stroke events. Symptoms reported included hyposmia (diminished sense of smell) and anosmia (complete loss of smell), and dysgeusia (distorted taste). Patients' sense of smell and taste were assessed in an ambulatory care stroke prevention clinic eight months following their strokes. Patient A presented with minor stroke due to a lesion in the anterior circulation, patient B with a lesion in the posterior circulation. Both patients reported intense olfactory and gustatory dysfunction immediately following their strokes. Examination revealed a general inability to detect subtle odours and the ability to identify only 'sweet' tastes for both patients. In addition, both patients reported heavily salting or sweetening their food to mask the distorted and unpleasant taste, which also impacted comorbid conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. Patients and their spouses reported a decrease in their appreciation of family-related activities due to the patients' olfactory and gustatory dysfunction. Patients reported weight loss, lack of energy and strength, likely due to poor nutrition.

Here, we examine whether point-of-care measurement of the purines, adenosine, inosine and hypoxanthine, which are downstream metabolites of ATP, has potential to assist the diagnosis of stroke. In a prospective observational study, patients who were suspected of having had a stroke, within 4.5 h of symptom onset and still displaying focal neurological symptoms at admission, were recruited. Clinical research staff in the Emergency Departments of two hospitals used a prototype biosensor array, SMARTCap, to measure the purines in the venous blood of stroke patients and healthy controls. In controls, the baseline purines were 7.1 ± (SD) 4.2 μM (n = 52), while in stroke patients, they were 11.6 ± 8.9 μM (n = 76). Using the National Institutes for Stoke Scale (NIHSS) to band the severity of stroke, we found that minor, moderate and severe strokes all gave significant elevation of blood purines above the controls. The purine levels fall over 24 h. This was most marked for patients with haemorrhagic strokes (5.1 ± 3.6 μM, n = 9 after 24 h).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23366386/,Monitoring cerebral hemodynamics with transcranial Doppler ultrasound during cognitive and exercise testing in adults following unilateral stroke,"An observational study was performed as a preliminary investigation into the use of transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) for recording cerebral hemodynamic changes during multiple tasks. TCD is a method of measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF) using ultrasound transducers in contact with the surface of the head. Using the maximum flow envelope of the Doppler spectrum returning from the middle cerebral artery (MCA), standard clinical flow indices can be calculated and displayed in real time providing information concerning perturbations in CBF and their potential cause. These indices as well as flow velocity measurements have been recognized as useful in measuring changes in responses to various stimulus that can be used to indicate cardiovascular health. For this study, the pulsatility index (PI) and resistivity index (RI) were chosen since they indicate composite changes indicative of vasoconstriction and vasodilatation which are normal hemodynamic responses under appropriate conditions. A total of eleven participants were recruited to take part in this study. Nine of these individuals had no known disability (Controls); two had experienced unilateral cerebrovascular accidents (Strokes) in the ipsilateral MCA distribution. Maximum velocity envelopes of the spectral Doppler data were recorded using a fixation device designed to stabilize two ultrasound probes (2 MHz) to sample the bilateral MCAs CBF. These measures were performed separately while the subject performed four activities: 1) rest, 2) cognitive challenge, 3) cardiovascular exercise, and 4) simultaneous exercise and cognitive challenge. Cardiovascular parameters were calculated from the data by extracting maximum (Vs) and minimum flow velocities (Vd), PI, RI, and time signatures for each cardiac cycle. The data for all participants shows significant changes in cardiovascular parameters between states of rest and exercise, as well as slight trends across time. Although the data are preliminary, they show the capability of using Doppler spectral examination of the bilateral MCAs in individuals with physical limitation performing cardiovascular exercise. The novelty of examining a population using dynamic exercise who before could not perform such exercise offers the opportunity to study the impact of exercise on global cerebral recovery in unilateral stroke with significant physical impairment.",,Brian P Watt;Judith M Burnfield;Edward J Truemper;Thad W Buster;Gregory R Bashford

Yet unlike its counterpart acute myocardial infarction (AMI), little has been done to promote early intervention in evolving strokes. Recommendations from the American Heart Association and more recently the European Stroke Initiative are available; however, in Australia (as with many other countries) practice guidelines are scarce and clinicians largely operate in an ad hoc manner with little awareness of 'best practice'. The controversial role of thrombolysis with limitations in respect to selecting appropriate patients, in addition to a small window of opportunity for therapeutic beneficial effects and a high risk for haemorrhage, has inhibited its widespread application. As such, emergent stroke management clearly lags behind that of AMI-both with respect to the range of treatment options and the application of best practice.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33074256/,Injection of Hydrogel Biomaterial Scaffolds to The Brain After Stroke,"Stroke is the leading cause of disability and the fifth-leading cause of death in the United States. Approximately 87% of all strokes are ischemic strokes and are defined as the sudden blockage of a vessel supplying blood to the brain. Within minutes of the blockage, cells begin to die and result in irreparable tissue damage. Current therapeutic treatments focus on clot removal or lysis to allow for the reperfusion and prevent more severe brain damage. Although transient brain plasticity may salvage some of the damaged tissue over time, significant fractions of patients are left with neurological deficits that will never resolve. There is a lack of therapeutic options to treat neurological deficits caused by stroke, emphasizing the need to develop new strategies to treat this growing patient population. Injectable biomaterials are currently being designed to enhance brain plasticity and improve endogenous repair through the delivery of active agents or stem cells. One method to test these approaches is to utilize a rodent stroke model, inject the biomaterial into the stroke core, and assess repair. Knowing the precise location of the stroke core is imperative for the accurate treatment after stroke, therefore, a stroke model that results in a predictable stroke location is preferable to avoid the need for imaging prior to injection. The following protocol will cover how to induce a photothrombotic stroke, how to inject a hydrogel in a controlled and precise manner, and how to extract and cryosection the brain while keeping the biomaterial intact. In addition, we will highlight how these same hydrogel materials can be used for the co-delivery of stem cells.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10672349/,[Preclinical treatment of patients with stroke],"Stroke is the third leading cause of death and number one cause of disability in industrialised countries. Studies into the pathophysiology of acute ischaemic stroke have indicated that treatment options are likely to be optimized when early signs of stroke are recognized and treatment is initiated within 3 hours from symptom onset. Therefore, new conceptions heading towards early diagnosis, fast preclinical treatment, structured diagnostics, immediate initiation of acute therapy as well as early initiation of rehabilitation are required. It is well known that, for most patients, there is a long delay between the onset of symptoms and the start of therapy. Many factors are responsible for the time delay:signs and symptoms often go unrecognized and/or are minimized by patients, relatives and bystanders. Unlike trauma or myocardial infarction, stroke is not given a high priority by medical staff and/or emergency medical services (EMS). Although a small number of stroke patients is treated as emergency and attended to by the emergency medical services within this time window, this number could easily be increased by intensified public and emergency personnel education. At present the standard of care by the EMS personnel includes adequate cerebral oxygenation, treatment of cardiac arrhythmia, management of hypertension as well as therapy of hyperglycemia and hyperthermia. For the future, we hope that emergency medical services will be able to initiate therapies which must be administered within the first few hours of acute stroke after onset of symptoms.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24391036/,Association of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene A1298C polymorphism with stroke risk based on a meta-analysis,"Several independent studies have reported the role of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) A1298C polymorphism in strokes, but the results are inconclusive. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed in the present study. In this meta-analysis, a total of 13 studies, including 1974 cases and 2660 controls, were selected to evaluate the possible association. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess the strength of the association in additive, dominant, and recessive models. The overall analysis showed that MTHFR A1298C was associated with a significant increase in the risk of stroke in the heterozygote comparison (AC vs AA: OR = 1.17; 95%CI = 1.03-1.34) and in the dominant model (AC/CC vs AA: OR = 1.22; 95%CI = 1.01-1.49). Stratified analysis showed a significantly strong association between the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and stroke risk in Asian populations (OR = 1.32 for AC vs AA; OR = 1.94 for CC vs AA; OR = 1.37 for AC/CC vs AA; OR = 1.33 for C vs A allele), but not in Caucasian populations. Additionally, the MTHFR 1298C allele was found to be a risk factor for developing ischemic strokes. However, no statistically significant increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke was found in any of the genetic models. In conclusion, this meta-analysis supported that the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism could be capable of increasing stroke susceptibility in Asian, but not in Caucasian, populations.",,Q Lv;J Lu;W Wu;H Sun;J Zhang

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16765823/,Trials in sickle cell disease,"Children with sickle cell disease are at risk of developing neurologic complications, including stroke, transient ischemic attack, seizures, coma, and a progressive reduction in cognitive function. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and overnight pulse oximetry appear to predict, making prevention an achievable goal so that there is now a focus on randomized controlled trials. The Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) reported a reduction in the number of overt clinical strokes experienced by those children with critically high transcranial Doppler velocities (>200 centimeters per second) who were chronically transfused. Two additional Phase III studies and two pilot trials have been funded. STOP II focused on whether it is safe to discontinue blood in prophylactically transfused children when their velocities had remained normal for at least 30 months. The Silent Infarct Transfusion trial is designed to determine whether children with sickle cell anemia and silent cerebral infarcts, approximately 20% of the population, will have a decrease in the progressive neurologic complications after receiving regular blood transfusion therapy. Pilot safety and feasibility trials of low-dose aspirin and overnight respiratory support are also beginning.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22712741/,Etiology of stroke and choice of models,"Animal models of stroke contribute to the development of better stroke prevention and treatment through studies investigating the pathophysiology of different stroke subtypes and by testing promising treatments before trials in humans. There are two broad types of animal models: those in which stroke is induced through artificial means, modeling the consequences of a vascular insult but not the vascular pathology itself; and those in which strokes occur spontaneously. Most animal models of stroke are in rodents due to cost, ethical considerations, availability of standardized neurobehavioral assessments, and ease of physiological monitoring. While there are similarities in cerebrovascular anatomy and pathophysiology between rodents and humans, there are also important differences, including brain size, length and structure of perforating arteries, and gray to white matter ratio, which is substantially lower in humans. The wide range of rodent models of stroke includes models of global and focal ischemia, and of intracerebral and sub-arachnoid hemorrhage. The most widely studied model of spontaneous stroke is the spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat, in which the predominant lesions are small subcortical infarcts resulting from a vascular pathology similar to human cerebral small vessel disease. Important limitations of animal models of stroke - they generally model only certain aspects of the disease and do not reflect the heterogeneity in severity, pathology and comorbidities of human stroke - and key methodological issues (especially the need for adequate sample size, randomization, and blinding in treatment trials) must be carefully considered for the successful translation of pathophysiological concepts and therapeutics from bench to bedside.",,Paul R Krafft;Emma L Bailey;Tim Lekic;William B Rolland;Orhan Altay;Jiping Tang;Joanna M Wardlaw;John H Zhang;Cathie L M Sudlow
