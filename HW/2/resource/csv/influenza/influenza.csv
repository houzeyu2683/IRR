https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27486731/,Human Influenza Virus Infections,"Seasonal and pandemic influenza are the two faces of respiratory infections caused by influenza viruses in humans. As seasonal influenza occurs on an annual basis, the circulating virus strains are closely monitored and a yearly updated vaccination is provided, especially to identified risk populations. Nonetheless, influenza virus infection may result in pneumonia and acute respiratory failure, frequently complicated by bacterial coinfection. Pandemics are, in contrary, unexpected rare events related to the emergence of a reassorted human-pathogenic influenza A virus (IAV) strains that often causes increased morbidity and spreads extremely rapidly in the immunologically naive human population, with huge clinical and economic impact. Accordingly, particular efforts are made to advance our knowledge on the disease biology and pathology and recent studies have brought new insights into IAV adaptation mechanisms to the human host, as well as into the key players in disease pathogenesis on the host side. Current antiviral strategies are only efficient at the early stages of the disease and are challenged by the genomic instability of the virus, highlighting the need for novel antiviral therapies targeting the pulmonary host response to improve viral clearance, reduce the risk of bacterial coinfection, and prevent or attenuate acute lung injury. This review article summarizes our current knowledge on the molecular basis of influenza infection and disease progression, the key players in pathogenesis driving severe disease and progression to lung failure, as well as available and envisioned prevention and treatment strategies against influenza virus infection.",,Christin Peteranderl;Susanne Herold;Carole Schmoldt
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24891213/,Continuing challenges in influenza,"Influenza is an acute respiratory disease in mammals and domestic poultry that emerges from zoonotic reservoirs in aquatic birds and bats. Although influenza viruses are among the most intensively studied pathogens, existing control options require further improvement. Influenza vaccines must be regularly updated because of continuous antigenic drift and sporadic antigenic shifts in the viral surface glycoproteins. Currently, influenza therapeutics are limited to neuraminidase inhibitors; novel drugs and vaccine approaches are therefore urgently needed. Advances in vaccinology and structural analysis have revealed common antigenic epitopes on hemagglutinins across all influenza viruses and suggest that a universal influenza vaccine is possible. In addition, various immunomodulatory agents and signaling pathway inhibitors are undergoing preclinical development. Continuing challenges in influenza include the emergence of pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009, human infections with avian H7N9 influenza in 2013, and sporadic human cases of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza. Here, we review the challenges facing influenza scientists and veterinary and human public health officials; we also discuss the exciting possibility of achieving the ultimate goal of controlling influenza's ability to change its antigenicity.",H1N1; H5N1; H7N9; antigenic changes; antiviral drugs; influenza virus; pandemic; vaccines; zoonosis.,Robert G Webster;Elena A Govorkova

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31845781/,Influenza: Diagnosis and Treatment,"Influenza is an acute viral respiratory infection that causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Three types of influenza cause disease in humans. Influenza A is the type most responsible for causing pandemics because of its high susceptibility to antigenic variation. Influenza is highly contagious, and the hallmark of infection is abrupt onset of fever, cough, chills or sweats, myalgias, and malaise. For most patients in the outpatient setting, the diagnosis is made clinically, and laboratory confirmation is not necessary. Laboratory testing may be useful in hospitalized patients with suspected influenza and in patients for whom a confirmed diagnosis will change treatment decisions. Rapid molecular assays are the preferred diagnostic tests because they can be done at the point of care, are highly accurate, and have fast results. Treatment with one of four approved anti-influenza drugs may be considered if the patient presents within 48 hours of symptom onset. The benefit of treatment is greatest when antiviral therapy is started within 24 hours of symptom onset. These drugs decrease the duration of illness by about 24 hours in otherwise healthy patients and may decrease the risk of serious complications. No anti-influenza drug has been proven superior. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all people six months and older who do not have contraindications.",,David Y Gaitonde;Faith C Moore;Mackenzie K Morgan

Influenza A, B, and C are 3 types of viruses responsible for illness. Type A virus has many subtypes based on antigens but Type B and Type C viruses have no known subtypes. Currently, influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and influenza type B viruses are circulating in humans. Transmission of influenza occurs through droplets from infected person or through direct contact with person or fomites. Clinically, influenza is characterized by acute onset fever, chills, running nose, cough, sore throat, headache and myalgia. Mostly, febrile illness lasts for 3-4 d with resolution of disease in 7-10 d. Confirmation of influenza can be done either by virus culture, RT-PCR or specific neutralizing antibodies in blood. Basic principles of management include prompt institution of infection control measures, early identification of children at higher risk, supportive care and antiviral drugs. Vaccine and chemoprophylaxis are two commonly used methods for prevention of influenza. Currently, inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) are available for use with good efficacy.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29447284/,"Influenza interaction with cocirculating pathogens and its impact on surveillance, pathogenesis, and epidemic profile: A key role for mathematical modelling","Evidence is mounting that influenza virus interacts with other pathogens colonising or infecting the human respiratory tract. Taking into account interactions with other pathogens may be critical to determining the real influenza burden and the full impact of public health policies targeting influenza. This is particularly true for mathematical modelling studies, which have become critical in public health decision-making. Yet models usually focus on influenza virus acquisition and infection alone, thereby making broad oversimplifications of pathogen ecology. Herein, we report evidence of influenza virus interactions with bacteria and viruses and systematically review the modelling studies that have incorporated interactions. Despite the many studies examining possible associations between influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, etc., very few mathematical models have integrated other pathogens alongside influenza. The notable exception is the pneumococcus-influenza interaction, for which several recent modelling studies demonstrate the power of dynamic modelling as an approach to test biological hypotheses on interaction mechanisms and estimate the strength of those interactions. We explore how different interference mechanisms may lead to unexpected incidence trends and possible misinterpretation, and we illustrate the impact of interactions on public health surveillance using simple transmission models. We demonstrate that the development of multipathogen models is essential to assessing the true public health burden of influenza and that it is needed to help improve planning and evaluation of control measures. Finally, we identify the public health, surveillance, modelling, and biological challenges and propose avenues of research for the coming years.",,Lulla Opatowski;Marc Baguelin;Rosalind M Eggo

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14643124/,Influenza,"Although most influenza infections are self-limited, few other diseases exert such a huge toll of suffering and economic loss. Despite the importance of influenza, there had been, until recently, little advance in its control since amantadine was licensed almost 40 years ago. During the past decade, evidence has accrued on the protection afforded by inactivated vaccines and the safety and efficacy in children of live influenza-virus vaccines. There have been many new developments in vaccine technology. Moreover, work on viral neuraminidase has led to the licensing of potent selective antiviral drugs, and economic decision modelling provides further justification for annual vaccination and a framework for the use of neuraminidase inhibitors. Progress has also been made on developing near-patient testing for influenza that may assist individual diagnosis or the recognition of widespread virus circulation, and so optimise clinical management. Despite these advances, the occurrence of avian H5N1, H9N2, and H7N7 influenza in human beings and the rapid global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome are reminders of our vulnerability to an emerging pandemic. The contrast between recent cases of H5N1 infection, associated with high mortality, and the typically mild, self-limiting nature of human infections with avian H7N7 and H9N2 influenza shows the gaps in our understanding of molecular correlates of pathogenicity and underlines the need for continuing international research into pandemic influenza. Improvements in animal and human surveillance, new approaches to vaccination, and increasing use of vaccines and antiviral drugs to combat annual influenza outbreaks are essential to reduce the global toll of pandemic and interpandemic influenza.",,Karl G Nicholson;John M Wood;Maria Zambon
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12806464/,[Influenza],"Influenza (flu) is an acute contagious viral infection characterized by inflammation of the respiratory tract that every winter affects more than 100 million people in Europe, Japan and the United States of America, also being responsible for several thousand of excess deaths (data from the United States reveal between 20,000 to 40,000 excess deaths annually). The Mixovirus influenzae is the agent that causes influenza, commonly called flu. There are 3 types of influenza virus: A, B, C, and only types A and B are perceived to be clinically relevant in humans. Due to the segmented nature of its genetic material, the influenza virus is highly mutagenic, causing frequent insertion of new antigenic strains into the community, against which the population presents no immunity. Presently, there are few options for the control of influenza and annual immunization is the most effective means to prevent disease and its complications. In Brazil, according to data collected by the VigiGripe's Project - linked to the Federal University of Sao Paulo -, circulation of the influenza virus also has a seasonal pattern, with peak activity occurring between May and September. Yearly vaccination is, therefore, best indicated on March and April. Currently, there are four medications available for the treatment of influenza viruses: amantadine and rimantadine, and two second generation pharmaceutical products, the neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir. The latter two drugs have set the stage for a new approach to the management and control of influenza infections.",,Eduardo Forleo-Neto;Elisa Halker;Verônica Jorge Santos;Terezinha Maria Paiva;João Toniolo-Neto

Epidemics of varying severity occur almost annually in temperate climates and are punctuated by the much less frequent but more dramatic occurrence of pandemic influenza. Increases in hospitalization and death often accompany widespread morbidity during influenza epidemics and pandemics. Influenza pandemics also threaten to disrupt other essential and nonessential services through high absenteeism, with high economic losses resulting.

Because recent H5N1 avian epizootics have been associated with sporadic human fatalities, concern has been raised that a new pandemic, as fatal as the pandemic of 1918, or more so, could be developing. Understanding the events and experiences of 1918 is thus of great importance. However, despite the genetic sequencing of the entire genome of the 1918 virus, many questions about the 1918 pandemic remain. In this review we address several of these questions, concerning pandemic-virus origin, unusual epidemiologic features, and the causes and demographic patterns of fatality. That none of these questions can yet be fully answered points to the need for continued pandemic vigilance, basic and applied research, and pandemic preparedness planning that emphasizes prevention, containment, and treatment with antiviral medications and hospital-based intensive care.",,David M Morens;Anthony S Fauci

This pattern of three waves, however, was not universal: in some locations influenza seems to have persisted into or returned in 1920. The recorded statistics of influenza morbidity and mortality are likely to be a significant understatement. Limitations of these data can include nonregistration, missing records, misdiagnosis, and nonmedical certification, and may also vary greatly between locations. Further research has seen the consistent upward revision of the estimated global mortality of the pandemic, which a 1920s calculation put in the vicinity of 21.5 million. A 1991 paper revised the mortality as being in the range 24.7-39.3 million. This paper suggests that it was of the order of 50 million.

In 2011, the Technical Advisory Group at the Pan American Health Organization, Regional Office of WHO for the Americas, reiterated the influenza vaccine recommendation for older adults. Relatively little information has been compiled on the immunological aspect of aging or on reducing its impact, information particularly relevant for clinicians and gerontologist with firsthand experience confronting its effects. To fill this data gap, in 2012 the Americas Health Foundation (Washington, D.C., United States) and the nonprofit, Fighting Infectious Diseases in Emerging Countries (Miami, Florida, United States), convened a panel of Latin American clinicians and gerontologists with expertise in influenza to discuss key issues and develop a consensus statement. The major recommendations were to improve influenza surveillance throughout Latin America so that its impact can be quantified; and to conduct laboratory confirmation of influenza for all patients who have flu-like symptoms and are frail, immunosuppressed, have comorbidities, are respiratory compromised, or have been admitted to a hospital. The panel also noted that: since evidence for antivirals in the elderly is unclear, their use should be handled on a case-by-case basis; despite decreased immunological response, influenza vaccination in older adults is still crucial; indirect immunization strategies should be encouraged; and traditional infection control measures are essential in long-term care facilities.",,Ricardo W Rüttimann;Pablo E Bonvehí;Diana Vilar-Compte;Raúl E Isturiz;Jaime A Labarca;Edison I Vidal

Influenza transmits predominantly by respiratory droplets and fomites but opportunistic airborne transmission may occur in the hospital setting due to overcrowding, poor compliance with infection control measures, and performance of aerosol-generating procedures.Areas covered: This article reviews the risk factors of nosocomial influenza outbreaks and discusses clinical, diagnostic, and treatment aspects of seasonal and avian influenza to facilitate hospital preparations for future influenza outbreaks. Literature search was conducted through PubMed of relevant peer-reviewed full papers in English journals with inclusion of relevant publications by the WHO and US CDC.Expert opinion: Accurate and rapid identification of an influenza outbreak is important to facilitate patient care and prevent nosocomial transmission. Timely treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) for adults hospitalized with severe influenza is associated with lower mortality and better clinical outcomes. Baloxavir, a polymerase endonuclease inhibitor, offers a new treatment alternative and its role in combination with NAI for treatment of severe influenza is being investigated.

Review of features of the 1918 influenza pandemic and subsequent ones helps in identifying areas where attention in planning is critical. Key among such issues are likely risk groups and which interventions to employ. Past pandemics have repeatedly underscored, for example, the vulnerability of groups such as pregnant women and taught other lessons valuable for future preparedness. While a fundamental difficulty in planning for the next pandemic remains their unpredictability and infrequency, this uncertainty can be mitigated, in part, by optimizing the handling of the much more predictable occurrence of seasonal influenza.

A variety of methods are available for the detection of the influenza viruses responsible for respiratory infection starting with the isolation of the virus in chick embryos or in cell lines such as MDCK, VERO, etc., and finishing with a variety of modifications of the classical PCR molecular biology such as PCR multiplex and Real-Time. The most effective way to combat influenza is through vaccination. Regular vaccination is one of the few steps that may be taken to protect individuals, especially in high-risk groups, from the potential and serious complications of influenza. In many countries, including Poland, despite the recommendations, the rate of vaccination against influenza is still low in all age groups.

Its seasonality in temperate climates has allowed estimates of mortality and severe morbidity, such as hospitalization, to be made statistically, without identifying cases virologically. Most influenza related mortality occurs in older individuals and those with underlying conditions. In addition to those groups, influenza hospitalizations occur in younger children and pregnant women.

The available inactivated vaccine is effective for preventing influenza and the serious disease and death that can accompany it. However, annual recommendations for vaccination among persons at risk have never been adequately implemented. This remains the most pressing current need for control of influenza. Amantadine, rimantadine, and the newly available drugs zanamivir and oseltamivir are effective for influenza prevention and treatment (the former two for influenza A only). The availability of four antiviral agents that effectively prevent and treat influenza provides the physician with considerable flexibility for their use in influenza control. Optimal application of the currently available vaccine and antiviral agents should substantially reduce the impact of influenza. Other methods for influenza treatment and control are under development, and a live attenuated vaccine with substantial potential for control is nearing approval. However, better inactivated vaccines, better rapid diagnostic tests, and an increased understanding of options for use of antiviral agents are still needed.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19627371/,"Understanding influenza transmission, immunity and pandemic threats","The current pandemic threat can be best understood within an ecological framework that takes account of the history of past pandemics caused by influenza A, the relationships between pandemic and seasonal spread of influenza viruses, and the importance of immunity and behavioural responses in human populations. Isolated populations without recent exposure to seasonal influenza seem more susceptible to new pandemic viruses, and much collateral evidence suggests that this is due to immunity directed against epitopes shared between pandemic and previously circulating strains of inter-pandemic influenza A virus. In the highly connected modern world, most populations are regularly exposed to non-pandemic viruses, which can even boost immunity without causing influenza symptoms. Such naturally-induced immunity helps to explain the low attack-rates of seasonal influenza, as well as the moderate attack-rates in many urbanized populations affected by 1918-1919 and later pandemics. The effectiveness of immunity, even against seasonal influenza, diminishes over time because of antigenic drift in circulating viruses and waning of post-exposure immune responses. Epidemiological evidence suggests that cross-protection against a new pandemic strain could fade even faster. Nevertheless, partial protection, even of short duration, induced by prior seasonal influenza or vaccination against it, could provide important protection in the early stages of a new pandemic.",,John D Mathews;Joanne M Chesson;James M McCaw;Jodie McVernon

Humans who are infected with the disease (referred to as human influenza A [H5N1]) have a greater than 50% mortality rate. Currently there has not been documented sustained human-to-human transmission; however, should the virus mutate and make this possible, the world could experience an influenza pandemic. Probable risk factors for infection include slaughtering, defeathering, and butchering fowl; close contact with wild birds or caged poultry; ingestion of undercooked poultry products; direct contact with surfaces contaminated with poultry feces; and close contact with infected humans. Possible risk factors include swimming in or ingesting water contaminated with bird feces or dead birds and the use of unprocessed poultry feces as fertilizer. Clinically, early human influenza A (H5N1) resembles typical influenza illnesses, with fever and a preponderance of lower respiratory tract symptoms. Often, patients develop rapidly progressive respiratory failure and require ventilatory support. Treatment is primarily supportive care with the addition of antiviral medications. Currently, travelers to countries with both human and avian influenza A (H5N1) have a low risk of developing the disease. There are no current recommended travel restrictions. Travelers are advised to avoid contact with all birds, especially poultry; avoid surfaces contaminated with poultry feces; and avoid undercooked poultry products.

Endemic in waterfowl and highly virulent in poultry, H5N1 is capable of incidentally infecting humans and other mammals. Although H5N1 is not yet capable of efficient human-to-human transmission, the protean nature of its genome could transform it into the source of the next human influenza pandemic. In the spring of 2006, migrating birds spread the virus from Asia to Europe and Africa. Preparing for a new influenza pandemic involves increasing global influenza surveillance and developing practical strategies for containing outbreaks at the source. Prompt case recognition, isolation, and treatment will be crucial for disease control. Pharmacologic interventions will focus on streamlining the production of vaccine, extending vaccine supplies, stockpiling antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir, and distributing these agents in a timely manner to persons who have the most need. Nonpharmacologic measures will include the use of masks, social distancing, quarantine, travel restrictions, and increasing the emergency capacity of health care systems.",,Gregory Juckett

While vaccine is the critical prophylaxis strategy in other populations, response rates are diminished, particularly early post-transplant, among immunocompromised patients. Prospective data suggest that antiviral prophylaxis represents an effective and safe alternative to vaccine in patients who would be predicted to have poor responses to influenza vaccine.

Children and young adults have the highest incidence of influenza infection each winter, but the highest incidences of severe or complicated influenza illness leading to hospitalization or death are in infants, elderly persons (especially those in nursing homes), and persons of all ages with underlying heart or lung disease. Influenza viruses infect respiratory epithelial cells and can themselves cause diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and severe hypoxia, but concomitant or secondary bacterial pneumonia is a much more frequent complication of influenza. Although pneumococci predominate in these secondary pneumonias, the relative incidence of Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia also increases during influenza epidemics; empiric antibiotic therapy in this setting should be directed against both of these organisms. A variety of other bacteria can cause postinfluenzal pneumonia, especially in patients with alcoholism or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and broad antimicrobial coverage including gram-negative bacteria is justified in such patients when diagnostic studies provide no guidance. Early amantadine therapy of influenza-like illness during an influenza A epidemic will reduce the duration of symptoms and possibly reduce complications.

Antiviral drugs are widely available for therapy and prophylaxis, but viral mutations have resulted in resistance that threatens to reduce the long-term utility of approved antivirals. Vaccination is the best method for controlling influenza, but vaccine strategies are blunted by virus antigenic drift and shift. Genetic shift in particular has led to four pandemics in the last century, which have prompted the development of efficient global surveillance and vaccination programs. Although the influenza pandemic of 2009 emphasized the need for the rapid standardization of global surveillance methods and the preparation and dissemination of global assay standards for improved reporting and diagnostic tools, outbreaks of novel influenza strains continue to occur, and current efforts must be enhanced by aggressive public education programs to promote increased vaccination rates in the global population. Recently, a novel H7N9 avian influenza virus with potential to become a pandemic strain emerged in China and was transmitted from animals to humans with a demonstrated >20% mortality rate. Sporadic outbreaks of highly lethal avian virus strains have already increased public awareness and altered annual vaccine production strategies to prevent the natural adaption of this virus to human-to-human transmission.

It's easy when the epidemiological context is appropriate; the patient is a school kid or a teenager, and the symptoms are typical. On the other hand, it is hard when it fails to match any of the above premises, the more imformation that is missing, the more difficult it becomes.

The patient often says he/she ""feels sick"" but his/her general condition is not at all serious. A rapid influenza diagnosis has been shown to reduce unnecessary test and antibiotics in pediatric patients and allows rational use of antivirals, early discharge from emergency departments and hospital wards, appropriate infection control measures and cohorting of infected patients. Tests that yield results in a timely manner that can influence clinical management are recommended to guide patient care. Results of testing should take into account the a priori likelihood of influenza infection based on the patient's signs and symptoms, the sensitivity and specificity of the test used, and information on circulation of influenza in the community.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9413531/,Influenza virus: transmission between species and relevance to emergence of the next human pandemic,"Although influenza viruses are not spread from human to human through the conventional food chain, this is not necessarily the case for the transmission of the precursors of the human pandemic influenza viruses. Aquatic birds of the world are the reservoirs for all influenza A viruses; the virus is spread by fecal-oral transmission in untreated water. Influenza A viruses are frequently transmitted to domestic poultry and two of the 15 subtypes H5 and H7 can become highly pathogenic and have the capacity to decimate commercial poultry flocks. Less frequently, avian influenza viruses are transmitted between species-to pigs, horses and sea mammals. This transmission involves mutational, reassortant or recombinational events and can occur through fecal contamination of unprocessed avian protein or through the water. The transmission of avian influenza viruses or virus genes to humans is postulated to occur through pigs that act as the intermediate host. This involves either multiple mutational or reassortant events and is believed to occur by airborne transmission. Once avian influenza viruses are established in mammals, they are transmitted from animal to animal by the respiratory airborne route. The transmission of avian influenza virus from their reservoir in wild aquatic birds to domestic poultry and to mammalian species including humans can be prevented by treatment of the water supply and of avian protein sources with disinfectants or by heating. Agricultural authorities have recommended the separation of wild aquatic and domestic poultry and of pig and poultry farming.

In primary influenza virus pneumonia, chest roentgenography revealed bilateral infiltrations but no consolidation. Histologically, diffuse alveolar damage and hemorrhagic bronchiolitis were frequently observed in primary influenza virus pneumonia, in which case the prognosis was the worst.

The virus mainly replicates in the respiratory tract and is spread by respiratory secretions. A growing concern is the recent identification of H5N1 strains of avian influenza A in Asia that were previously thought to infect only wild birds and poultry, but have now infected humans, cats, pigs, and other mammals, often with fatal results, in an ongoing outbreak. A human pandemic with H5N1 virus could potentially be catastrophic because most human populations have negligible antibody-mediated immunity to the H5 surface protein and this viral subtype is highly virulent. Whether an H5N1 influenza pandemic will occur is likely to hinge on whether the viral strains involved in the current outbreak acquire additional mutations that facilitate efficient human-to-human transfer of infection. Although there is no historical precedent for an H5N1 avian strain causing widespread human-to-human transmission, some type of influenza A pandemic is very likely in the near future. The possibility of an H5N1 influenza pandemic has highlighted the many current limitations of treatment with antiviral agents and of vaccine production and immunogenicity.

Recent evidence showed that the gene sequences of this novel H7N9 virus is primarily zoonotic and may be better adapted than other avian influenza viruses to infect human. Effective global infection control is urgently needed, and further surveillance and analyses should be undertaken to identify the source and mode of transmission of these viruses.",,Ren-Bin Tang;Hui-Lan Chen
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21087110/,Cross-protective immunity to influenza A viruses,"Antigenic changes in influenza virus occur gradually, owing to mutations (antigenic drift), and abruptly, owing to reassortment among subtypes (antigenic shift). Availability of strain-matched vaccines often lags behind these changes, resulting in a shortfall in public health. In animal models, cross-protection by vaccines based on conserved antigens does not completely prevent infection, but greatly reduces morbidity, mortality, virus replication and, thus, viral shedding and spread. Such immunity is especially effective and long-lasting with mucosal administration. Cross-protective immunity in humans is controversial, but is suggested by some epidemiological findings. 'Universal' vaccines protective against all influenza A viruses might substantially reduce severity of infection and limit spread of disease during outbreaks. These vaccines could be used 'off the shelf' early in an outbreak or pandemic, before strain-matched vaccines are available.",,Suzanne L Epstein;Graeme E Price

Based on the analysis and integration of relevant ecological, epidemiological, clinical, genetic and experimental data, the present article is focused on the evolution of 'virus - victim' ecological systems resulting in the formation of innate (i.e. genetic, constitutional) immunity in the involved species and populations. This kind of immunity functions today as the greatest natural barrier to the pandemic spread of influenza among humans and ecologically related kinds of animals. Global influenza pandemics can arise when the worldwide population contains at least a minimum number of people susceptible to a known or mutant influenza virus. Special attention is paid in this article to individual tests for the presence of this barrier, including the implications of specific findings for public health policy.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17939760/,Medical management of influenza infection,"Antiviral drugs are important in the management of seasonal influenza and critical to pandemic planning. Although several other classes of anti-influenza compounds exist, the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors are currently the only option in most clinical settings. These drugs, zanamivir and oseltamivir, prevent the release of newly replicated influenza virions from infected cells. They are highly effective when used for treatment of seasonal influenza early in the course of infection, or for prevention when given soon after exposure. Treatment strategies for avian influenza infections in humans are still provisional owing to inadequate clinical data. As predicted by molecular studies, resistance to the NA inhibitors is now emerging, although at a level less significant than adamantane resistance. NA inhibitor resistance is a cause for concern if indeed some mutant strains of avian influenza are transmissible and pathogenic. In the near term, appropriate use of the available NA inhibitors will be of major benefit in lessening morbidity and mortality due to influenza infection. Priorities include developing appropriate formulations and guidelines for use of these drugs in children and people infected with avian influenza, study of the mechanisms and clinical significance of drug resistance, and identification of new antiviral therapies that target different points in the viral life cycle in order to limit the effect of emerging drug resistance.",,Anne Moscona

Between December 26, 2003 and October 13, 2005, there had been 117 documented human infections and 60 deaths (mortality, 51%) in four Asian countries: Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia. Human influenza sustained by H5N1 virus is usually characterized by a severe lower respiratory tract infection, leading to a progressive respiratory failure and several extra-respiratory complications. Infected birds have been the primary source of influenza H5N1 infection in humans in Asia, but transmission from poultry to humans is very limited at present, and requires a direct exposure to live birds, whereas there was no significant risk related to eating well-cooked poultry meat. Human-to-human transmission of H5N1 virus has been suggested in several household clusters, but it seems very uncommon at present. All the viral genes of human H5N1 isolates were of avian influenza origin, which indicates absence of reassortment with human influenza viruses, but H5N1 continue to evolve and persistent monitoring is requested to identify any increase in viral adaptation to man, which could lead to a human pandemic.",,Leonardo Calza;Roberto Manfredi;Francesco Chiodo

Detection of influenza outbreaks in this setting can be difficult, because the clinical presentation in older adults is atypical and other pathogens also cause influenza-like illness (ILI) during the influenza season. Use of the standard case definition for influenza has not been effective in detecting episodes in residents of LTCFs. Alternative case-definitions that reflect the atypical presentation of influenza in this population have been recommended but not validated. The use of rapid tests for the detection of influenza in conjunction with more sensitive case definitions of ILI may lead to the earlier detection of influenza outbreaks in LTCFs, earlier initiation of infection control measures, and reduction in transmission. The definition of outbreak, eg, the number of episodes of ILI or episodes of confirmed influenza A that would result in the initiation of antiviral chemoprophylaxis, remains controversial in this setting. The use of newer antivirals could limit the side effects seen in older adults in LTCFs. However, annual vaccination of residents and staff remains the most effective way to prevent the introduction of influenza A or influenza B into LTCFs.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20408444/,[Changing management of pandemic influenza],"In April 2009, for the first time in 41 years, a novel type of influenza A virus acquired the capacity for human-to-human transmission and caused a pandemic. This virus was derived from swine A (H1N1), which was a recombination of avian, human, and several swine influenza viruses, and named the ""pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus"". As of mid-November, approximately 500,000 confirmed cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection had been reported to the World Health Organization. The true worldwide disease burden is yet unknown, but at least 100 times more people than those reported to the WHO have already been infected with this virus. The initial outbreak of this disease occurred in Mexico, and then the United States and Canada. Japan introduced strict quarantine measures including the screening of airline passengers for fever using thermography, which is useless for detecting patients during the incubation period. The result was that the first domestically-infected case was reported to be symptomatic on May 5th, four days prior to the detection of the first ""imported cases"" on May 9th at Narita Airport. This case was detected with other cases involved in a local outbreak of this disease through the strict policy of laboratory testing, i.e. focusing on cases that had any epidemiological link with known cases or overseas travel, which was implemented by the government. The epidemic seems to be close to its peak in Japan. The nature of the disease is mild, with mostly mild cases especially in younger generations. The case-fatality ratio is about 1:100,000 (0.001%), which is much lower than that of seasonal flu. A vaccination campaign is on the way, although vaccine supply is still very limited. In conclusion, there is still much uncertainty regarding this disease. The flexibility of the policy in response to its nature might have saved us from an initial catastrophe in affected regions, and should be well-reflected for the preparation of the next, unforeseeable pandemic of emerging infectious disease.",,Keita Morikane

The new swine flu H1N1 virus is a mixture of avian, porcine and human influenza RNA. With twenty thousand confirmed cases worldwide and 117 deaths within 7 weeks of the first acknowledgement of a possible pandemic by Mexican and WHO experts, the mortality rate is less than 0.1% and the majority of deaths centred upon the origin of the epidemic in Mexico [83%]. Swine flu is thus far a relatively mild illness seen predominantly in those who are healthy and under 25 years of age, perhaps reflecting protection from previous human influenza exposure in older people. As the virus spreads internationally, border protection issues have surfaced and public health initiatives are being progressively rolled out to minimise the transmission. Vaccines are being developed which will be trialled in the coming months with a likely availability by August 2009, in time for the northern hemisphere autumn and winter.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10977472/,"Epidemiology and virology of influenza illness. Based on a presentation by Arnold S. Monto, MD","Although researchers have demonstrated that influenza illness has affected societies for many centuries, in more recent decades, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have developed sophisticated means of tracking the virus' activity around the globe. The importance of tracking influenza activity lies not only in detecting what is circulating in other countries, but also in enabling global manufacturers of vaccine to prepare the appropriate A and B compositions for the impending epidemic. Tracking influenza also allows quantification of its great toll in terms of morbidity and mortality. Influenza has broad societal and financial impact, with as much as $12 to $14 billion in indirect economic impact in the United States annually and a significant increase in physician visits for febrile respiratory illness. For example, during many influenza outbreaks visits to family care physicians and internal medicine specialists can increase by 150% to 450%. Influenza presents an ongoing public health issue because of the virus' ability to continually reinvent itself. Antigenic drift, caused by subtle changes in influenza's surface proteins, partially accounts for annual epidemic outbreaks of the illness. Antigenic shift that occurs because of major changes in the viral hemagglutinin and sometimes in the neuraminidase, the other surface protein, results in the more widespread and lethal pandemic forms of influenza. Moreover, type A influenza is not an exclusively human infection. By understanding how both of these types of changes occur in waterfowl, the virus' primary nonhuman hosts, scientists can develop both drugs and epidemiological strategies to avert or minimize the most severe effects of influenza.",,

These individuals shed virus for a prolonged period of time, have a high rate of viral pneumonia, more frequently develop bacterial and fungal super-infections, and may develop late-onset airflow obstruction. Further, antiviral resistance develops more frequently in immunosuppressed patients.

Several types of pneumonia associated with the influenza virus infection have been reported: 1) influenza complicated by secondary bacterial pneumonia, 2) primary influenza virus pneumonia, 3) combined influenza virus and bacterial pneumonia. Secondary bacterial pneumonia often produces a syndrome that is clinically distinguishable from that of primary viral pneumonia. In primary influenza virus pneumonia, chest roentgenography revealed bilateral infiltrations but no consolidation. Histologically, diffuse alveolar damage and hemorrhagic bronchiolitis were frequently observed in primary influenza virus pneumonia, in which case the prognosis was the worst. Although rare, the possibility of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia associated with influenza virus infection should be recognized. H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, or S. aureus were frequently associated with influenza viral infection, and treatment against these bacteria should be considered.",,Jiro Fujita

This increases the risk of the emergence of a reassortant pandemic influenza virus with improved human-to-human transmissibility. Currently triage of suspected cases by epidemiological risk factors remains the only practical way of case identification for laboratory investigation and infection control. The clinical usefulness of rapid diagnostic laboratory tests requires more vigorous evaluation. The lethality of this disease may reflect systemic viral dissemination, cytokine storm, or alveolar flooding due to inhibition of cellular sodium channels. The present circulating genotype Z is intrinsically resistant to amantadine and rimantadine. Prognosis may be improved by early treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor with good systemic drug levels, and post-exposure prophylaxis for health care workers is recommended. The role of immunomodulators and other modalities of therapy requires evaluation in randomised controlled trials, with prospective monitoring of the viral load and cytokine profiles in various clinical specimens. In view of the high fatality of the disease, a combination of contact, droplet, and airborne precautions are recommended as long as resources allow despite the fact that the relative importance of these three modes in nosocomial transmission of avian influenza is still unknown.",,K Y Yuen;S S Y Wong

The virus is believed to have emerged from a reassortment event involving a swine virus some time in the past 10 to 20 years, but pigs, pork, and pork products have not been involved with infection or spread of the virus to or among people. Because countries quickly implemented recently developed pandemic influenza plans, the disease was detected and reported and public health authorities instituted control measures in a timely fashion. But the news media's unfortunate and inappropriate naming of the disease as the ""swine flu"" led to a drop in the demand for pork and several countries banned pork imports from affected countries, resulting in serious negative economic impacts on the pork industry. With the continual circulation and interspecies transmission of human, swine, and avian influenza viruses in countries around the world, there are calls for strengthening influenza surveillance in pigs, birds, and other animals to aid in monitoring and assessing the risk of future pandemic virus emergence involving different species. We identify and discuss several lessons to be learned from pandemic H1N1 2009 from a One Health perspective, as stronger collaboration among human, animal, and environmental health sectors is necessary to more effectively prevent or detect and respond to influenza pandemics and thus improve human, animal, and environmental health and well-being.",,Marguerite Pappaioanou;Marie Gramer

Pandemics occurred in 1918 (swine influenza), 1957 (Asian influenza), 1968 (Hong Kong influenza) and 1977 (Russian influenza) due to major antigenic variation of the type A influenza virus. Frequent epidemics occur after pandemics as a result of minor antigenic variation of the pandemic virus strains. Minor antigenic variant strains of type A (H1N1), A (H3N2) and type B influenza viruses are currently circulating globally, causing frequent epidemics. The World Health Organization (WHO) has established a network of National Influenza Centres all over the world to study the epidemiology and ecology of influenza, and collaborating centres for updating the influenza vaccines and other research activities. As a part of this programme, it has set up the WHO Flunet for disseminating updates on the global influenza situation, current vaccines and antiviral drugs.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21647170/,Seasoned adaptive antibody immunity for highly pathogenic pandemic influenza in humans,"Fundamentally new approaches are required for the development of vaccines to pre-empt and protect against emerging and pandemic influenzas. Current strategies involve post-emergent homotypic vaccines that are modelled upon select circulating 'seasonal' influenzas, but cannot induce cross-strain protection against newly evolved or zoonotically introduced highly pathogenic influenza (HPI). Avian H5N1 and the less-lethal 2009 H1N1 and their reassortants loom as candidates to seed a future HPI pandemic. Therefore, more universal 'seasoned' vaccine approaches are urgently needed for heterotypic protection ahead of time. Pivotal to this is the need to understand mechanisms that can deliver broad strain protection. Heterotypic and heterosubtypic humoral immunities have largely been overlooked for influenza cross-protection, with most 'seasoned' vaccine efforts for humans focussed on heterotypic cellular immunity. However, 5 years ago we began to identify direct and indirect indicators of humoral-herd immunity to protein sites preserved among H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 influenzas. Since then the evidence for cross-protective antibodies in humans has been accumulating. Now proposed is a rationale to stimulate and enhance pre-existing heterotypic humoral responses that, together with cell-mediated initiatives, will deliver pre-emptive and universal human protection against emerging epidemic and pandemic influenzas.",,Garry W Lynch;Paul Selleck;W Bret Church;John S Sullivan

This makes it possible to save on antibiotics and indirect costs. Studies of recent years provide enough evidence for guidelines. Given timely treatment, there is no need for cross-sectoral healthcare, because the family doctor can handle both the vaccination program and the antiviral therapy. If an influenza wave is confirmed by official statistics, clinical diagnosis alone is sufficient. The course of the illness can be influenced by the insured person's own initiative.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20633930/,Swine influenza (H1N1) and acute appendicitis,"Background: During the swine influenza (H1N1) pandemic that began in 2009, many hospitalized adults had gastrointestinal symptoms. The most common symptoms associated with swine influenza (H1N1) were nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. In the experience of the authors, swine influenza was not complicated by abdominal pain. There are a wide variety of infectious and non-infectious disorders that may present with a pain in the right lower quadrant, mimicking appendicitis, ie, pseudoappendicitis. Influenza predisposes to some types of bacterial infection, eg, influenza pneumonia may be complicated by simultaneous Staphylococcus aureus community-acquired pneumonia or subsequent community-acquired pneumonia due to Haemophilus influenzae or Streptococcus pneumoniae. It remains unclear if there is direct involvement of the appendix, ie, pseudoappendicitis as occurs with measles or if influenza itself somehow predisposes to increased frequency/severity of bacterial appendicitis. German clinicians first noted an increased incidence of acute appendicitis in children/young adults with influenza. The American and British cases of influenza and acute appendicitis compared to age-matched controls with more severe and of delayed onset/complicated by appendicial perforation/abscess. These reports noted an increased incidence/severity of acute appendicitis during influenza.",,Burke A Cunha;Francisco M Pherez;Nicole Durie

Of 369 reported human H5N1 cases that occurred from 1997 through 2007, overall mortality was 60%. Ten antigenically and genetically distinct clades of H5N1 viruses have been identified to date, and strains from four clades have infected humans. Surveillance has focused upon hospitalized cases of febrile acute lower respiratory tract disease among persons with exposure to sick or dead poultry, or to a human H5N1 case. Detection of H5N1 virus infection is based primarily upon collection of respiratory tract specimens from suspected cases for RT-PCR testing. Most human H5N1 cases were previously healthy children or young adults who developed severe acute pulmonary or multi-organ disease following direct or close contact with sick or dead H5N1 virus-infected poultry. Occasional clusters of H5N1 cases have occurred, predominantly among blood-related family members. Limited human-to-human H5N1 virus transmission has been reported or could not be excluded in some clusters. The frequency of asymptomatic or clinically mild H5N1 virus infection is unknown, but limited investigations suggest that such infections have been rare since 2003. There is no evidence of sustained human-to-human H5N1 virus spread. However, H5N1 viruses continue to circulate and evolve among poultry in many countries, and there are many unanswered questions about human infection with H5N1 viruses.

One such group is residents of nursing homes or other long-term care facilities. During influenza epidemics, mortality rates among nursing home residents often exceed 5 percent. To lessen the impact of this infection, the influenza vaccine is recommended as the primary way of preventing the illness and its complications. Many studies have shown that vaccination of nursing home residents and staff can significantly decrease rates of hospitalization, pneumonia, and related mortality. When an influenza outbreak occurs in a nursing home, several measures can be implemented by the treating physician. Treatment and prophylaxis can be accomplished using antiviral medications such as amantadine, rimantadine, and oseltamivir. The antiviral medication zanamivir can be used in the treatment of influenza, but not for prophylaxis. Once an outbreak has been established, control measures, including vaccination of unvaccinated residents and employees, and limitations on resident movement and visits, can be implemented.",,Brian J Kingston;Charles V Wright Jr

We investigate the problem using a mathematical model that separates the interaction of strains through cross-immunity from the process of emergence for new antigenic variants. Evolutionary constraints are also included with antigenic mutation incurring a fitness cost. We show that the transmissibility of a strain can become disproportionately important in dictating the rate of antigenic drift: strains that spread only slightly more easily can have a much higher rate of emergence. Further, we see that the effect continues when vaccination is considered; a small increase in the rate of transmission can make it much harder to control the frequency at which new strains emerge. Our results not only highlight the importance of considering both transmission and fitness constraints when modelling influenza evolution, but may also help in understanding the differences between the emergence of H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes.",,Adam Kucharski;Julia R Gog

Like other pandemic influenza strains, the 1918 A/H1N1 strain spread extremely rapidly. A measure of transmissibility and of the stringency of control measures required to stop an epidemic is the reproductive number, which is the number of secondary cases produced by each primary case. Here we obtained an estimate of the reproductive number for 1918 influenza by fitting a deterministic SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model to pneumonia and influenza death epidemic curves from 45 US cities: the median value is less than three. The estimated proportion of the population with A/H1N1 immunity before September 1918 implies a median basic reproductive number of less than four. These results strongly suggest that the reproductive number for 1918 pandemic influenza is not large relative to many other infectious diseases. In theory, a similar novel influenza subtype could be controlled.

By June 2009, widespread infections were recorded all over the world and an ongoing pandemic was declared. The clinical manifestations ranged from a self limited illness to fatal disease. Current clinical data suggest that the highest infection rates and complications occur in children and young adults. In contrast to seasonal influenza, the rates of hospitalization and death in adults 65 years or older were low. Risk factors for severe disease are similar to those of seasonal influenza and include diverse medical conditions. However, pregnant women and children with neurodevelopmental disorders or chronic pulmonary conditions are at highest risk of developing severe disease. Rapid antigen detection tests have variable and suboptimal sensitivity for diagnosis of novel H1N1 influenza. Diagnosis is confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or by virus isolation in cell culture. Treatment is recommended with oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamavir for patients who are at risk of complications as well as those who are worsening clinically or have evidence of lower respiratory tract infection. Treatment with intravenous peramivir can be used in special situations when oral or inhaled antiviral therapy is not tolerated or considered inadequate.

The morbidity will be highest if a pandemic similar to Asian influenza reappears, while mortality will be highest if a Spanish flu is repeated.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3591813/,Clinical manifestations and consequences of influenza,"The spread of influenza virus through a community typically causes large increases in medical visits for febrile respiratory disease. Increased school absenteeism occurs early in the epidemic, and school children appear to be important for disseminating the virus. Industrial absenteeism, hospitalizations of adults and infants for pneumonia, and deaths due to pneumonia-influenza all tend to peak later in the epidemic. Although influenza infection rates are highest in persons of school age, hospitalizations and deaths occur primarily in infants and in the elderly, particularly among those with pulmonary, cardiovascular, or other debilitating disorders. Influenza viruses can be spread by aerosol or contact. The primary target cells are those of the respiratory epithelium. In healthy adults, the typical influenza syndrome includes fever, cough, and general aches for three to seven days, but lassitude, cough, and evidence of small-airways disease may persist for weeks. Laryngotracheobronchitis, pneumonia, and unexplained fever are prominent manifestations of influenza that lead to hospitalization of young children. Adults are more likely to have complications of bacterial pneumonia and worsening of chronic pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure. Less frequent complications include myositis, various neurologic disorders, and Reye's syndrome.

We tested this hypothesis within a countrywide, sentinel general practitioners-based surveillance system in France. We included 2277 individuals aged 65years or older (of whom 1293 had been vaccinated against influenza, 56.8%) who consulted a general practitioner because of an acute respiratory infection (ARI) during 2003-2014. All patients were taken a nasopharyngeal swab, and information was collected on demographic characteristics and symptoms at disease onset. All specimens were tested for respiratory viruses and, if positive for influenza, the virus type and subtype were determined. We compared the average maximum temperature and the frequency of each symptom, between non-vaccinated and vaccinated influenza patients. We then used logistic regression models to calculate the odds of presenting with each symptom between vaccinated vs. non-vaccinated patients, adjusting by age group, virus (sub)type and season. Overall, 675 ARI patients (29.6%) tested positive for influenza. The A(H3) virus caused the majority of cases (55.1%), followed by influenza B (22.9%), A not-subtyped (11.7%), and A(H1) (10.3%) viruses. Compared to non-vaccinated influenza patients, those who had been vaccinated had a slightly reduced maximum temperature and presented less frequently with myalgia, shivering and headache. In stratified analyses, the observed effect was limited to patients infected with A(H3) or type B viruses. After adjusting by age group, virus (sub)type and season, the difference remained statistically significant only for headache, which was less frequent among vaccinated individuals (odds ratio 0.69, 95% confidence intervals 0.48-0.98).

For persons who are not vaccinated or for whom vaccines fail to prevent influenza, there are 2 classes of efficacious drugs for treatment or chemoprophylaxis: M2 channel inhibitors and neuraminidase inhibitors. Effective treatment, however, must commence within 48 h of the onset of symptoms, which can create problems for patients who wait to see whether their symptoms worsen or improve. Older adults who have relocated to the congregate housing environments of assisted living and long-term care facilities deserve special consideration, because influenza exposure risks are different for this group.

An average sample of the population is covered by both syndromic and virological surveillance, which provides timely data regarding the onset and course of the influenza wave as well as its burden of disease. However, smaller influenza outbreaks cannot be detected by the AGI sentinel system. This is achieved by the information reported by the mandatory notification system (Protection Against Infection Act, IfSG), which serves as the second pillar of the national influenza surveillance. Approaches to recognize such outbreaks are based either on reported influenza virus detection and subsequent investigations by local health authorities or by notification of an accumulation of respiratory diseases or nosocomial infections and subsequent laboratory investigations. In this context, virological diagnostics plays an essential role. This has been true particularly for the early phase of the 2009 pandemic, but generally timely diagnostics is essential for the identification of outbreaks. Regarding potential future outbreaks, it is also important to keep an eye on animal influenza viruses that have repeatedly infected humans. This mainly concerns avian influenza viruses of the subtypes H5, H7, and H9 as well as porcine influenza viruses for which a specific PCR has been established at the National Influenza Reference Centre.

In deciding how countries should react to this potential pandemic, individually and collectively, a reasonable and practical balance must be struck between the rights and obligations of individual citizens and protection of the wider community and, indeed, society as a whole. In this communication, ethical issues are discussed in the context of some of the scientific questions relating to a potential influenza pandemic. Among these issues are the rights and obligations of healthcare professionals, difficulties surrounding resource allocation, policies that have an impact on liberty and trade, when and how to introduce any vaccine or other form of mass treatment, global governance questions and the role of health policies in contemporary society. By considering these issues and questions in advance of an influenza, or indeed any other, pandemic commencing, countries can be better prepared to deal with the inevitably difficult decisions required during such events, rather than dusting down outdated previous plans, or making and implementing policy in an ad hoc manner with a resultant higher risk of adverse consequences.",,U Schuklenk;K M A Gartland

A revised calculation of the 1918-1919 pandemic estimates that 40 million persons died and 500 million were infected. The mortalities in 1957 and 1968 were nearly 6 million. Biological and genetic characteristics of the causative agents of the more recent pandemics, have been well studied but little is known about the causative agent of the Great Pandemic in 1918. Genetic characterisation of the 1918 virus has been achieved by sourcing virus RNA from formalin fixed lung samples or by exhuming frozen victims of the outbreak from Arctic regions. Initial analysis of the HA gene from two USA sources indicates a virus related to swine and human influenza with no base insertion at the HA1-HA2 cleavage junction which, at least in avian influenza A, characterises high virulence. Important unanswered questions are whether the 1918 virus spread pantropically perhaps to include the brain and hence cause encephalitis including the later lethargic forms, or whether infection was confined to the respiratory tract. Re-examination of reports of respiratory disease in England and France in 1916-1917 may indicate a non-Spanish origin of the pandemic and a period of 2 years for the virus to be seeded worldwide.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18581909/,[Influenza in children--an epidemiological problem],"Influenza is an acute viral disease which mainly affects the respiratory tract and occurs in all age groups with yearly epidemics during the cold season. It is a frequent and occasionally severe disease in children, particularly in young infants and school age children with a high rate of complications (mainly secondary bacterial infections) which frequently require hospitalization. Children are usually the first victims of the yearly epidemics and effectively distribute the virus in the community and their families. These specific characteristics warrant discussions about modifications of the current immunization strategy in countries like Switzerland, where high risk individuals are the primary immunization targets. An universal influenza immunization strategy would be reasonable from an individual as well as epidemiological point of view. However, the need for repeated yearly vaccination as well as suboptimal acceptance of influenza immunization amongst physicians and the public are significant hurdles, which would need to be overcome.",,U Heininger

There is no consistent explanation for influenza's transmission patterns that applies to both temperate and tropical regions. This study aimed to determine the relationship between ambient humidity and viability of the influenza A virus (IAV) during transmission between hosts and to explain the mechanisms underlying it. We measured the viability of IAV in droplets consisting of various model media, chosen to isolate effects of salts and proteins found in respiratory fluid, and in human mucus, at relative humidities (RH) ranging from 17% to 100%. In all media and mucus, viability was highest when RH was either close to 100% or below ∼50%. When RH decreased from 84% to 50%, the relationship between viability and RH depended on droplet composition: viability decreased in saline solutions, did not change significantly in solutions supplemented with proteins, and increased dramatically in mucus. Additionally, viral decay increased linearly with salt concentration in saline solutions but not when they were supplemented with proteins. There appear to be three regimes of IAV viability in droplets, defined by humidity: physiological conditions (∼100% RH) with high viability, concentrated conditions (50% to near 100% RH) with lower viability depending on the composition of media, and dry conditions (<50% RH) with high viability. This paradigm could help resolve conflicting findings in the literature on the relationship between IAV viability in aerosols and humidity, and results in human mucus could help explain influenza's seasonality in different regions.",,Wan Yang;Subbiah Elankumaran;Linsey C Marr

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23112382/,"'A most protean disease': aligning medical knowledge of modern influenza, 1890-1914","This article reconstructs the process of defining influenza as an infectious disease in the contexts of British medicine between 1890 and 1914. It shows how professional agreement on its nature and identity involved aligning different forms of knowledge produced in the field (public health), in the clinic (metropolitan hospitals) and in the laboratory (bacteriology). Two factors were crucial to this process: increasing trust in bacteriology and the organisation of large-scale collective investigations into influenza by Britain's central public authority, the Medical Department of the Local Government Board. These investigations integrated epidemiological, clinical and bacteriological evidence into a new definition of influenza as a specific infection, in which a germ - Bacillus influenzae - was determined as playing a necessary but not sufficient role in its aetiology, transmission and pathogenesis. In defining 'modern influenza', bacteriological concepts and techniques were adapted to and selectively incorporated into existing clinical, pathological and epidemiological approaches. Mutual alignment thus was crucial to its construction and, more generally, to shaping developing relationships between laboratory, clinical and public health medicine in turn-of-the-century Britain. While these relationships were marked by tension and conflict, they were also characterised by important patterns of convergence, in which the problems, interests and practices of public health professionals, clinicians and laboratory pathologists were made increasingly commensurable. Rather than retrospectively judge the late nineteenth-century definition of influenza as being based on the wrong microbe, this article argues for the need to examine how it was established through a particular alignment of medical knowledge, which then underpinned medical approaches to the disease up to and beyond the devastating 1918-19 pandemic.",,Michael Bresalier

The survey considered hospital organization and preparedness planning and conduct, as well as the opinion of the infectious diseases professionals regarding several key issues. Between 7 March and 22 March 2010, 303 responses, corresponding to 12.8% of the SEIMC membership, were received.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21775293/,Can photoperiod predict mortality in the 1918-1920 influenza pandemic?,"Amplitude of the seasonal change in day length increases with distance from the equator, and changes in day length markedly alter immune function in diverse nonhuman animal models of infection. Historical records of mortality data, ambient temperature, population density, geography, and economic indicators from 42 countries during 1918-1920 were analyzed to determine relative contributions toward human mortality during the ""Spanish"" influenza pandemic of 1918-1920. The data identify a strong negative relation between distance from the equator and mortality during the 1918-1920 influenza pandemic, which, in a multiple regression model, manifested independent of major economic, demographic, and temperature variables. Enhanced survival was evident in populations that experienced a winter nadir day length ≤10 h light/day, relative to those that experienced lower amplitude changes in photoperiod. Numerous reports indicate that exposure to short day lengths, typical of those occurring outside the tropics during winter, yields robust and enduring reductions in the magnitude of cytokine, febrile, and behavioral responses to infection. The present results are preliminary but prompt the conjecture that, if similar mechanisms are operant in humans, then they would be predicted to mitigate symptoms of infection in proportion to an individual's distance from the equator. Although limitations and uncertainties accompany regression-based analyses of historical epidemiological data, latitude, per se, may be an underrecognized factor in mortality during the 1918-1920 influenza pandemic. The author proposes that some proportion of the global variance in morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases may be explained by effects of day length on the innate immune response to infection.",,Brian J Prendergast
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21203714/,[Pandemic influenza A(H1N1): the experience of the Spanish Laboratories of Influenza Network (ReLEG)],"There are three types of influenza viruses: A, B, C. These viruses evolves constantly due to two main characteristics: the first one is the lack of the correction ability of the viral polymerase which causes the accumulation of single nucleotide mutations in the viral genes introduced by an error-prone viral RNA polymerase, (antigenic shift). The second one is the nature of their genome, formed by eight segments, which allows the interchange of genes between two different viral strains (antigenic drift). This viral plasticity, has allowed to the influenza A viruses to infect new host species and to cause infections with a pandemic characteristics. The Spanish influenza surveillance system, SVGE (its Spanish acronym), arises as a response to the possibility of facing a pandemic situation, especially after the transmission of avian influenza viruses to humans. This surveillance system is formed by sixteen physician and paediatrics network, nineteen epidemiological services coordinated by the National Epidemiological Centre (CNE) and eighteen laboratories , the Spanish Laboratories of Influenza network (ReLEG), coordinated by the National Centre of Microbiology. The aim of this article is to show the action of the ReLEG, in the pandemic caused by the influenza virus A(H1N1) during the season 2009-2010.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21731764/,Dynamics of airborne influenza A viruses indoors and dependence on humidity,"There is mounting evidence that the aerosol transmission route plays a significant role in the spread of influenza in temperate regions and that the efficiency of this route depends on humidity. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms by which humidity might influence transmissibility via the aerosol route have not been elucidated. We hypothesize that airborne concentrations of infectious influenza A viruses (IAVs) vary with humidity through its influence on virus inactivation rate and respiratory droplet size. To gain insight into the mechanisms by which humidity might influence aerosol transmission, we modeled the size distribution and dynamics of IAVs emitted from a cough in typical residential and public settings over a relative humidity (RH) range of 10-90%. The model incorporates the size transformation of virus-containing droplets due to evaporation and then removal by gravitational settling, ventilation, and virus inactivation. The predicted concentration of infectious IAVs in air is 2.4 times higher at 10% RH than at 90% RH after 10 min in a residential setting, and this ratio grows over time. Settling is important for removal of large droplets containing large amounts of IAVs, while ventilation and inactivation are relatively more important for removal of IAVs associated with droplets <5 µm. The inactivation rate increases linearly with RH; at the highest RH, inactivation can remove up to 28% of IAVs in 10 min. Humidity is an important variable in aerosol transmission of IAVs because it both induces droplet size transformation and affects IAV inactivation rates. Our model advances a mechanistic understanding of the aerosol transmission route, and results complement recent studies on the relationship between humidity and influenza's seasonality. Maintaining a high indoor RH and ventilation rate may help reduce chances of IAV infection.",,Wan Yang;Linsey C Marr

We introduce and use a large-scale stochastic simulation model to investigate the spread of a pandemic strain of influenza virus through the U.S. population of 281 million individuals for R(0) (the basic reproductive number) from 1.6 to 2.4. We model the impact that a variety of levels and combinations of influenza antiviral agents, vaccines, and modified social mobility (including school closure and travel restrictions) have on the timing and magnitude of this spread. Our simulations demonstrate that, in a highly mobile population, restricting travel after an outbreak is detected is likely to delay slightly the time course of the outbreak without impacting the eventual number ill. For R(0) < 1.9, our model suggests that the rapid production and distribution of vaccines, even if poorly matched to circulating strains, could significantly slow disease spread and limit the number ill to <10% of the population, particularly if children are preferentially vaccinated. Alternatively, the aggressive deployment of several million courses of influenza antiviral agents in a targeted prophylaxis strategy may contain a nascent outbreak with low R(0), provided adequate contact tracing and distribution capacities exist. For higher R(0), we predict that multiple strategies in combination (involving both social and medical interventions) will be required to achieve similar limits on illness rates.",,Timothy C Germann;Kai Kadau;Ira M Longini Jr;Catherine A Macken

Although immunization is the principal means of influenza prophylaxis, a well-matched efficacious vaccine is unlikely to be widely available for several months following the emergence of the pandemic strain.

However, the benefit of antiviral use can be compromised if drug-resistant strains arise. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to explore the impact of vaccination and antiviral treatment on the transmission dynamics of influenza. The model includes both drug-sensitive and resistant strains. Analytical results of the model show that the quantities R(SC) and R(RC), which represent the control reproduction numbers of the sensitive and resistant strains, respectively, provide threshold conditions that determine the competitive outcomes of the two strains. These threshold conditions can be used to gain important insights into the effect of vaccination and treatment on the prevention and control of influenza. Numerical simulations are also conducted to confirm and extend the analytic results. The findings imply that higher levels of treatment may lead to an increase of epidemic size, and the extent to which this occurs depends on other factors such as the rates of vaccination and resistance development. This suggests that antiviral treatment should be implemented appropriately.",,Zhipeng Qiu;Zhilan Feng

Hayden, MD","Vaccine represents the primary means of preventing influenza. Although influenza vaccines provide a high rate of protection in young and ambulatory elderly, a lower rate of protection occurs in the frail elderly and immunocompromised hosts. Researchers have developed new vaccine strategies that use live attenuated, cold-adapted virus vaccines. In children, this cold-adapted influenza vaccine appears to offer broader protection than the classic inactivated vaccine given by injection. It was protective against an antigenic variant, and by protecting against influenza, it reduces influenza-related complications, such as otitis media and lower respiratory tract illness, as well as lessens antibiotic use associated with these complications. Cold-adapted vaccine is well tolerated and represents a very exciting advance in influenza vaccines. Two drugs, amantadine and rimantadine, have received Food and Drug Administration approval for the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza A virus infection. However, their use is limited by side effects, particularly with amantadine, in elderly people (an activity limited to influenza A) and the emergence of resistance. A new class of specific anti-influenza agents, the neuraminidase inhibitors, has demonstrated potent inhibition of both influenza A and B viruses.

Antiviral treatment was found to be the most effective measure to control new influenza outbreaks. In the case of inadequate antiviral resources, the preferred approach was the centralized use of antiviral resources in the early stage of the epidemic. Immigration detection was the least cost-effective; however, when used in combination with the other measures, it may play a larger role. The reasonable mix of the three control measures could reduce the number of clinical cases substantially, to achieve the optimal control of new influenza.",,Wen-Dou Zhang;Zheng-Hu Zu;Qing Xu;Zhi-Jing Xu;Jin-Jie Liu;Tao Zheng

We developed a novel approach to reconstruct the genetic history of human influenza A (H3N2) collected worldwide over 1998 to 2009 and used it to infer the global network of influenza transmission. Consistent with previous models, we find that China and Southeast Asia lie at the center of this global network. However, we also find that strains of influenza circulate outside of Asia for multiple seasons, persisting through dynamic migration between northern and southern regions. The USA acts as the primary hub of temperate transmission and, together with China and Southeast Asia, forms the trunk of influenza's evolutionary tree. These findings suggest that antiviral use outside of China and Southeast Asia may lead to the evolution of long-term local and potentially global antiviral resistance.

Not only does influenza impose huge infrastructure demands on health care systems, but it exacts substantial economic costs in terms of sickness-related absenteeism, disrupted work schedules and lost productivity to society at large. Influenza accounts for around 10% of sickness-related absence from work in Europe where the likely cost of lost productivity in France and Germany, for example, ranges from 5.6 billion pounds to 8.5 billion pounds per year, according to ESWI estimates. But how to assess the full economic impact of influenza? The direct costs are easily enough identified, but what about the indirect costs? How should these be measured? How for example, does one assess the cost of lost opportunities, and what are the economic gains of vaccination regarding avoided costs? Finally, which target groups for vaccination would generate the greatest avoided costs? Leaving aside the moral implications of such a question, the fact remains that politicians and health policymakers need the cold hard figures to optimally allocate the costs of vaccination and preventative health campaigns.

Most persons born before 1890 had detectable pre-epidemic antibody against A/Hong Kong/68 whereas most persons born after 1899 had no detectable pre-epidemic antibody. The lower attack rate in the older age group is consistent with the hypothesis that influenza A viruses with similar or identical hemagglutinins can reemerge over time and that remote previous experience with the same or a similar strain can be protective. Also, no age group born after 1890 was found to have a high prevalence of antibody against A/England/72 or A/Dunedin/73, the successors to A/Hong Kong/68, indicating that recycling of hemagglutinin antigens is not strictly ordered.",,S C Schoenbaum;M T Coleman;W R Dowdle;S R Mostow

Over 99% of those who contracted the virus survived, in spite of the absence of antivirals, vaccine and antibiotics for the secondary bacteria infections which probably accounted for one-third of the 50 million deaths. Therefore, in spite of a three-fold population increase since 1918 and 100 thousand plane journeys daily, judicious and careful planning together with a stockpile of antiviral drugs, oseltamivir, zanamivir and M2 blockers and a generic H5N1 vaccine, and application of hygiene would be expected to reduce mortality in a new pandemic, to figures significantly less than 1918.",,J S Oxford;R Lambkin;A Elliot;R Daniels;A Sefton;D Gill

In this study, we extended the previous studies for the prevention of the pandemic influenza to evaluate the time-dependent optimal prevention policies, which are associated with elimination policy and quarantine policy, considering its execution cost. Actually, the execution cost affects the optimal strategy of prevention policies and the prevention of the disease spread. We found that the quarantine policy is very important rather than the elimination policy during the disease spread, even if the unit execution cost of the quarantine policy is more expensive than that of the elimination policy. And also, the change of the unit execution cost does affect the total cumulative cost of the optimal prevention policies but does not affect the relative frequency of each cumulative execution cost.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12686091/,The epidemiology and clinical impact of pandemic influenza,"It is impossible to predict when the next pandemic of influenza will occur; however, it is almost 35 years since the last pandemic, and the longest inter-pandemic interval recorded with certainty is 39 years. The next pandemic virus is likely to emerge in southeast Asia, as have two of the last three pandemic viruses. Complete global spread is likely to occur in 6 months or less, due to increased travel and urbanisation. It is likely that the usual inter-pandemic pattern of age-specific mortality will deviate temporarily towards higher mortality in younger adults. The extent to which this will happen is unclear, as the shift was extreme in 1918-1919 but less so in subsequent pandemics. Nevertheless, this may have important implications for the protection of essential workers such as health care, emergency service and military personnel. The extent to which elderly persons will be affected will depend upon previous exposure to similar influenza viruses. It is impossible to predict the likely increase in excess mortality that will occur when a new pandemic virus emerges. However, whilst mortality on the scale experienced in 1918-1919 is probably unlikely, there was a high level of mortality among those infected with the A/H5N1 virus in 1997, so it cannot be assumed that a future pandemic will be as mild as those in 1957-1958 or 1968-1969. There is likely to be more than one wave of infection and health services in most countries will be hard pressed to provide vaccines or to manage populations with clinical attack rates of approximately 25-30% and concomitant increases in demand for both primary and secondary health care services.",,Jonathan S Nguyen-Van-Tam;Alan W Hampson

Among students who returned questionnaires, clinical attack rates were extraordinarily high (73.2% of those less than or equal to 23 years of age and 45.7% for those greater than 23 years (p less than 0.001)), and rates were higher in students who lived on campus (p less than 0.05). Employing the criterion of hemagglutination inhibition titer greater than or equal to 16, 89.8% of those less than or equal to 23 years of age had evidence of infection by March, 1978. Illness was generally mild, and no complications were reported.

Understanding how and to what extent people would change their behaviour in response to influenza outbreaks is critical for formulating public health policies. We incorporated the information-theoretic framework into a behaviour-influenza (BI) transmission dynamics system in order to understand the effects of individual behavioural change on influenza epidemics. We showed that information transmission of risk perception played a crucial role in the spread of health-seeking behaviour throughout influenza epidemics. Here a network BI model provides a new approach for understanding the risk perception spread and human behavioural change during disease outbreaks. Our study allows simultaneous consideration of epidemiological, psychological, and social factors as predictors of individual perception rates in behaviour-disease transmission systems. We suggest that a monitoring system with precise information on risk perception should be constructed to effectively promote health behaviours in preparation for emerging disease outbreaks.",,C-M Liao;S-H You;Y-H Cheng

We characterize and evaluate hypothetical public health measures during the 1918 influenza pandemic in the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland. The transmission rate, the recovery rate, the diagnostic rate, the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic cases, and the proportion of clinical cases are estimated through least-squares fitting of the model to epidemic curve data of the cumulative number of hospital notifications. The latent period and the case fatality proportion are taken from published literature. We determine the variance and identifiability of model parameters via a simulation study. Our epidemic model agrees well with the observed epidemic data. We estimate the basic reproductive number for the spring wave R1;=1.49 (95% CI: 1.45-1.53) and the reproductive number for the fall wave R2;=3.75 (95% CI: 3.57-3.93). In addition, we estimate the clinical reporting for these two waves to be 59.7% (95% CI: 55.7-63.7) and 83% (95% CI: 79-87). We surmise that the lower reporting in the first wave can be explained by a lack of initial awareness of the epidemic and the relative higher severity of the symptoms experienced during the fall wave.

Rigorous analysis of the model, which stratifies the infected population in terms of their risk of developing severe illness, reveals that it exhibits a vaccine-induced backward bifurcation when the associated reproduction number is less than unity. The epidemiological consequence of this result is that the effective control of H1N1, when the reproduction number is less than unity, in the population would then be dependent on the initial sizes of the subpopulations of the model. For the case where the vaccine is perfect, it is shown that having the reproduction number less than unity is necessary and sufficient for effective control of H1N1 in the population (in such a case, the associated disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable). The model has a unique endemic equilibrium when the reproduction number exceeds unity. Numerical simulations of the model, using data relevant to the province of Manitoba, Canada, show that it reasonably mimics the observed H1N1 pandemic data for Manitoba during the first (Spring) wave of the pandemic. Further, it is shown that the timely implementation of a mass vaccination program together with the size of the Manitoban population that have preexisting infection-acquired immunity (from the first wave) are crucial to the magnitude of the expected burden of disease associated with the second wave of the H1N1 pandemic. With an estimated vaccine efficacy of approximately 80%, it is projected that at least 60% of Manitobans need to be vaccinated in order for the effective control or elimination of the H1N1 pandemic in the province to be feasible. Finally, it is shown that the burden of the second wave of H1N1 is expected to be at least three times that of the first wave, and that the second wave would last until the end of January or early February, 2010.",,O Sharomi;C N Podder;A B Gumel;S M Mahmud;E Rubinstein

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17433374/,The role of health care workers and antiviral drugs in the control of pandemic influenza,"Until a vaccine against the new strain becomes available, the response to newly emerged pandemic influenza will consist of the use of antiviral drugs and measures that limit exposure to infectious individuals. These first-line defence measures include isolating cases upon diagnosis, reducing close contacts, the use of personal protective equipment and hygiene, and using antiviral drugs for treatment and prophylaxis. There are significant 'costs' associated with control measures, so to justify such interventions it is important to assess their potential to reduce transmission. In this paper, we determine the effect that a number of different antiviral interventions have on the reproduction number of infectives and the probability that an imported infection fades out, and determine parameter scenarios for which these interventions are able to eliminate an emerging pandemic of influenza. We also assess the role that health care workers play in transmission and the extent to which providing them with antiviral prophylaxis and personal protective equipment modifies this role. Our results indicate that this class requires protection to avoid a greatly disproportionate contribution to early infective numbers, and for the maintenance of a stable health care system. Further, we show that the role children play in increasing transmission is moderate, in spite of closer mixing with other children.",,Belinda Barnes;Kathryn Glass;Niels G Becker

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25707182/,Animal and human influenzas,"Influenza type A viruses affect humans and other animals and cause significant morbidity, mortality and economic impact. Influenza A viruses are well adapted to cross species barriers and evade host immunity. Viruses that cause no clinical signs in wild aquatic birds may adapt in domestic poultry to become highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses which decimate poultry flocks. Viruses that cause asymptomatic infection in poultry (e.g. the recently emerged A/H7N9 virus) may cause severe zoonotic disease and pose a major pandemic threat. Pandemic influenza arises at unpredictable intervals from animal viruses and, in its global spread, outpaces current technologies for making vaccines against such novel viruses. Confronting the threat of influenza in humans and other animals is an excellent example of a task that requires a One Health approach. Changes in travel, trade in livestock and pets, changes in animal husbandry practices, wet markets and complex marketing chains all contribute to an increased risk of the emergence of novel influenza viruses with the ability to cross species barriers, leading to epizootics or pandemics. Coordinated surveillance at the animal- human interface for pandemic preparedness, risk assessment, risk reduction and prevention at source requires coordinated action among practitioners in human and animal health and the environmental sciences.

We explore the economic aspects of stockpiling various types and combinations of RPDs by adapting a pandemic model that estimates the impact of a severe pandemic on a defined population, the number of potential interactions between patients and health care personnel, and the potential number of health care personnel needed to fulfill those needs. Our model calculates the number of the different types of RPDs that should be stockpiled and the consequent cost of purchase and storage, prorating this cost over the shelf life of the inventory. Compared with disposable N95 or powered air-purifying respirators, we show that stockpiling reusable elastomeric half-face respirators is the least costly approach. Disposable N95 respirators take up significantly more storage space, which increases relative costs. Reusing or extending the usable period of disposable devices may diminish some of these costs. We conclude that stockpiling a combination of disposable N95 and reusable half-face RPDs is the best approach to preparedness for most health care organizations. We recommend against stockpiling powered air-purifying respirators as they are much more costly than alternative approaches.",model; pandemics; respiratory protective devices; stockpiles.,Gio Baracco;Sheri Eisert;Aaron Eagan;Lewis Radonovich

This possibility has increased concern, interest, and investigation in the influenza field. This heightened interest was reflected in the participation of numerous health officials, clinicians, and scientific investigators in the Sixth Conference on the Options for the Control of Influenza held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada from June 17-23, 2007. A recurring theme was that H5N1 viruses and the now-available reassortant/recombinant viruses from the 1918 pandemic have striking pathological and molecular similarities. Understanding these similarities, and how the viruses differ from currently circulating strains will be critical for timely preparation of the appropriate vaccines and antiviral therapies if a new pandemic should arise. To that end, this international conference was a fully comprehensive exchange of information covering public health, pandemic planning/preparedness, current and developing vaccines, animal ecology/zoonosis, mathematical modeling, virology, and viral immunology.

However, the extent and likely impact are still uncertain. Like seasonal flu, the illness is mild and self-limiting in a great majority of cases, with only 1%-2% of patients requiring hospitalization. In a few cases, the clinical course can deteriorate in a matter of hours, leading to severe complications and eventually death. The risk of complications is higher among those who have preexisting diseases, such as asthma, heart disease and kidney disease, and among pregnant women. In such cases, antiviral treatment should not be delayed pending laboratory confirmation. The preferred antiviral drug is oseltamivir, and zanamivir is an alternative. Antiviral treatment is not necessary for those who are otherwise healthy, and have mild or uncomplicated illness. It is beneficial for patients with progressive lower respiratory tract disease or pneumonia, and those with underlying medical conditions and pregnant patients. As the supply of antivirals is limited, they should be used judiciously and where appropriate. There is a limited supply of pandemic influenza vaccine available in a few countries and efforts to produce it in India are presently underway. Effective personal preventive measures include shielding one's mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing, frequent washing of hands with soap, avoiding mass gatherings and voluntary isolation by symptomatic individuals.

The medical literature was full of contradictory claims of their success; there was apparently no consensus on how to judge the reported results of these vaccine trials.

The general decline in the baseline of age-specific excess mortality in economically developed countries is characterized and its importance assessed. Models of acute and chronic care facilities are discussed and an argument is advanced that society as a whole as well as acute care facilities cannot be protected against incursion and widespread infection in pandemics of severity above low moderate. The key findings of models of chronic care institutions and others that can control public access, such as corporations, are used to describe programs with a realistic chance of providing protection in even severe pandemics. These principles are further mapped onto individual residences. Materials directing institutional and home planning are cited.",,Tom Reichert

Patient demographics, clinical manifestations and neurologic outcomes were reviewed. A total of 1,389 children were diagnosed with influenza A H1N1 by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Of these, 23 (1.7%) patients had neurologic involvement. Their mean age was 5.9 ± 3.6 yr (range, 6 months to 11 yr) and 16 (69.9%) were boys. None of the 23 patients had been vaccinated for influenza A H1N1 and seasonal influenzas. Twenty-two of the 23 patients presented with seizures. Clinical features included febrile convulsion (n = 19), afebrile convulsion (n = 1), aseptic meningitis (n = 1), encephalopathy (n = 1), and acute necrotizing encephalopathy (n = 1).

Although the counting of all influenza cases in real time is often not feasible, empirical observations always involve diagnostic test procedures. This offers an opportunity to jointly quantify transmission dynamics and diagnostic accuracy. We have developed a joint estimation procedure that exploits parsimonious models to describe the epidemic dynamics and that parameterizes the number of test positives and test negatives as a function of time. Our analyses of simulated data and data from the empirical observation of interpandemic influenza A (H1N1) from 2007-08 in Japan indicate that the proposed approach permits a more precise quantification of the transmission dynamics compared to methods that rely on test positive cases alone. The analysis of entry screening data for the H1N1 pandemic 2009 at Tokyo-Narita airport helped us quantify the very limited specificity of influenza-like illness in detecting actual influenza cases in the passengers. The joint quantification does not require us to condition diagnostic accuracy on any pre-defined study population.

Our experience as clinical advisers in the Victorian Department of Human Services Emergency Operations Centre suggests the following: Case definitions may change frequently, and will tend to become more clinically specific over time. Early in a pandemic, laboratory diagnosis plays a critical role in case finding and pathogen identification. Later in the pandemic, standardised case management applied to well crafted case definitions should reduce reliance on the diagnostic laboratory in clinical management. The diagnostic laboratory will remain critical to monitoring disease surveillance, pathogen virulence, and drug susceptibility. Medical logistics will continue to challenge pandemic managers as the health sector struggles to do the most good for the greatest number of people.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8747776/,Orthomyxoviral and paramyxoviral infections in transplant patients,"In summary, orthomyxo- and paramyxoviruses cause clinically important infections in transplant patients. Patients often develop lower respiratory tract involvement and sometimes respiratory failure, which almost is uniformly fatal. Bone marrow transplant recipients appear to be at higher risk of severe disease than are solid-organ recipients, but well defined criteria to predict those patients who will be severely affected are not available. Factors associated with more severe disease include the type of viral pathogen, with pneumonia occurring more commonly with RSV and PIV infection, and the degree of immunosuppression of the patient, particularly the pre-engraftment phase in bone marrow transplant recipients. Because mortality is associated with development of pneumonia, prompt diagnosis and studies for concurrent infections are essential. Evaluation of fever and upper respiratory tract symptoms in patients in the peritransplant period should include sampling of nasopharyngeal and throat for virus isolation and antigen detection for respiratory viruses. If patients develop lower respiratory tract symptoms, early bronchoscopy with BAL is indicated. No specific antiviral therapy has proved effective in the treatment of established respiratory viral infections of transplant patients. Aerosolized ribavirin or, in the instance of influenza A virus infection, oral rimantadine might be considered as early therapy to prevent severe lower respiratory disease. Intravenous ribavirin, currently available on a compassionate use basis, might be considered for treating measles virus infection. In patients with lower tract disease due to RSV, the addition of immunoglobulin with high neutralizing antibody titers to RSV or intravenous ribavirin are additional considerations to forestall respiratory failure. Controlled studies of these interventions are needed in transplant patients before their use can be recommended routinely.",,C A Sable;F G Hayden

In particular the 1918 pandemic caused more than 50 million deaths worldwide-the most deaths caused by any infectious disease ever in human history. Influenza pandemics in 1890 and earlier in the 19th century and back until at least the 16th century also caused non-trivial mortality. The excessively high mortality from flu in these years is thought to be due to major antigenic shifts in influenza strains, as opposed to smaller drifts in flu strains in years between pandemics. It is also thought that flu strains cycle naturally; however, as the 1918 pandemic was caused by an H1N1 strain, the 1957 pandemic by an H2N2 strain and the 1968 pandemic by an H3N2 flu, there have not been sufficient strains in an era when they could be evaluated molecularly to prove natural flu cycling in the human population.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12597114/,Simulating the effect of quarantine on the spread of the 1918-19 flu in central Canada,"Quarantine is often proposed and sometimes used to control the spread of infectious diseases through a human population. Yet there is usually little or no information on the effectiveness of attempting to quarantine humans that is not of an anecdotal or conjectural nature. This paper describes how a compartmental model for the geographic spread of infectious diseases can be used to address the potential effectiveness of human quarantine. The model is applied to data from the historical record in central Canada around the time of the 1918-19 influenza epidemic. Information on the daily mobility patterns of individuals engaged in the fur trade throughout the region prior to, during, and immediately after the epidemic are used to determine whether rates of travel were affected by informal quarantine policies imposed by community leaders. The model is then used to assess the impact of observed differences in travel on the spread of the epidemic. Results show that when mobility rates are very low, as in this region, quarantine practices must be highly effective before they alter disease patterns significantly. Simulation results suggest, though, that effectiveness varies depending on when the limitation on travel between communities is implemented and how long it lasts, and that a policy of introducing quarantine at the earliest possible time may not always lead to the greatest reduction in cases of a disease.",,Lisa Sattenspiel;D Ann Herring

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9128812/,Haemophilus influenzae b-vaccination: the urgency for timely vaccination,"In Germany the annual number of systemic Haemophilus influenzae cases in unvaccinated children aged 3-60 months has recently been exceeded by the number of cases in children vaccinated at least once with the PRP-D, HbOC or OMP vaccines, which until 1995 have almost exclusively been used for H. influenzae b (Hib) vaccination. Most of the vaccinated children however could already have had more vaccinations at onset of disease. How much does an age-related suboptimal vaccination status increase the risk for systemic H. influenzae infections? A case control study was performed in West Germany. Cases with systemic H. influenzae infections were ascertained between 7/92 and 8/ 94 with an ongoing active hospital surveillance programme. Six age-matched population controls per case were recruited at random. Only vaccinated cases and controls were included in the study. The main exposure analysed in this study was suboptimal vaccination at censoring; for censoring ages (age at disease onset in cases and corresponding age in matched controls) > 6 months: one vaccination in 1st year only; > 18 months: two (three for combined vaccines with Hib + DT or DPT in one syringe) vaccinations in the 1st year of life but no booster vaccination. Suboptimal vaccination for age increased the risk for systemic H. influenzae infections by a factor of 4.74 (95%-CI 2.17-10.34). Following adjustment for confounders the odds ratio was 4.39 (95%-CI 1.74-11.07). Subgroup analyses showed that this risk was not related to the type of vaccine used. The risk for ""no booster vaccination"" in children aged > 18 months appeared even greater than the risk associated with one vaccination in the 1st year only.",,R von Kries;O Böhm;A Windfuhr

People who are hospitalised with or die from this novel virus are more likely to have predisposing risk factors. There is a predilection for younger age groups and sparing of older age groups. This may be a property of influenza A viruses in general rather than being specific to swine influenza A. If unchecked, the sheer number of cases may lead to much higher numbers of deaths and hospitalised patients than would normally be attributed to a standard influenza season. Paradoxically, the low case-fatality rate of the virus raises the question of how best to approach management of this outbreak.

Although many cases are mild, its pathogenesis is not necessarily low as it often causes serious respiratory disorder in children, and thus early treatment is necessary. As the positive rate as determined by rapid diagnostic kit is low, and false negative results can occur when the test is conducted too early following symptomatic onset, patients suspected of pdmH1 influenza warrant initiation of treatment even before establishment of a definite diagnosis. For therapeutic drugs, oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir can be similarly efficacious, but intravenous administration is required in patients suffering symptoms of respiratory disorder and/or vomiting. As for the infectiousness, based on higher household transmission from parents to children in comparison to seasonal influenza A (FluA), as well as a high prevalence among primary school children, pdmH1 appears more likely to affect children, especially school children. In addition, since pdmH1 has a long incubation period, which can facilitate latent viral transmission, wearing a mask is useful during the epidemic period. A judgment of recovery should be carefully made especially in children, because the virus remains for a long time even after resolution of fever.",,Nobuo Hirotsu;Akira Takahashi;Yutaka Hatori;Kouichi Miyakawa

The outbreak occurred in a Los Angeles nursing home between February and March 1983. Of the 87 residents, 46 (53%) were affected with influenza-like illness. Attack rates were similar between immunized and unimmunized residents (52% versus 58%), and yielded a vaccine effectiveness estimate of 10%. No additional protection could be demonstrated in residents who received vaccine for two consecutive years. Seven persons died (mortality rate of 8.1%); the mortality rate was greater in the unimmunized (15.8%) than in the immunized (6.2%). Because this study and other field studies of influenza vaccine are limited in precision and power, a statistical summary of the various studies was constructed. Summarizing the studies of institutionalized elderly (in hospitals and nursing and retirement homes) yielded an estimate of 74% for the average vaccine effectiveness in mortality reduction, and an estimate of 33% for the average effectiveness in preventing clinical illness. For the non-institutionalized elderly, the corresponding estimates were 47% for mortality, and 5% for clinical illness. Despite the obvious limitations of such summaries, it seems reasonable to conclude that influenza vaccines have on the average been of clear benefit in the institutionalized elderly, while the benefits in the non-institutionalized elderly have been less dramatic and may warrant further investigation.",,M A Strassburg;S Greenland;F J Sorvillo;L E Lieb;L A Habel

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20422833/,[The military role in a flu pandemic],"Pandemic influenza is a major challenge to emergency preparedness agencies and health systems throughout the world. It requires preparation for a situation of widespread morbidity due to flu and its complications which will lead to a huge burden on the health system in the community and in hospitals, and work absenteeism, also among health care personnel. This may require major involvement of the army in both preparedness and measures to be taken to tackle such an event. This article reviews the different roles armies could take in such a crisis, and presents the Israeli test case. Defense systems are characterized by a number of attributes that may be major advantages during pandemic influenza: crisis management capacities, ability to deal with varied tasks in sub-optimal conditions, logistic resources (fuel, food and water), widespread deployment in the country and sometimes in the world, and the ability to activate people in risky situations, even against their will. The army roles during pandemic outbreaks could include: taking national and regional command of the event, assigning workforce for essential civilian missions, use of logistic and military resources, maintaining public order and implementing public health measures such as isolation and quarantine. In addition, the army must continue its primary role of maintaining the security and guarding the borders of the state, especially in times of global geopolitical changes due to pandemic. Since March 2009, the influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus spread throughout the world, leading the WHO to declare a state of pandemic influenza. According to Israeli preparedness plans, the management of the event was supposed to pass to the defense system. However, due to the moderate severity of the illness, it was decided to leave the management of the event to the health system. In view of the necessity of maintaining military combat capabilities, and the possibility of outbreaks in combat units, which actually occurred, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) policy for the pandemic was stricter than the policy of the Ministry of Health. Defense systems in Israel and the world should prepare, the sooner the better, for the possibility of a worse pandemic, in which the army may take a major role, especially since regular life in the country, in such a case, would be disturbed.",,Vered Molina Hazan;Ran D Balicer;Itamar Groto;Salman Zarka;Omer E Ankol;Yael Bar-Zeev;Hagai Levine;Nachman Ash
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19144247/,Was encephalitis lethargica a post-influenzal or some other phenomenon? Time to re-examine the problem,"Encephalitis lethargica (EL) was first reported in 1917 in central Europe. It became epidemic in the winter of 1918/1919 concurrently with the pandemic of influenza, and by then had reached Russia and North America. It spread throughout the world in epidemic form, mainly in the succeeding winters, up to 1927. By then about 65 000 cases had been reported, although the true number worldwide can only be guessed at. EL mortality was about 30% in the acute stage, and similar during recurrences. Half of the survivors had persistent or recurrent neuro-psychiatric illness, with Parkinsonism a frequent end stage. Most contemporary observers attributed EL to a virus and some believed it was specifically a post-influenzal complication. The epidemiology of EL mostly points to an infective cause, e.g. a seasonal respiratory or gastrointestinal virus with infrequent encephalitic expression but the ability to persist, flare and progressively damage the brain. However, any link with the influenza virus strain of 1918/1919 remains hypothetical. The aetiological theories that have been applied to EL are reviewed and the question is raised whether broader laboratory investigation might now reveal a continuing low endemicity of EL and identify its cause.",,P P Mortimer

On the other hand, the neuraminidase subunits of the Hong Kong virus are related to those of the A/Asian strains. The haemagglutinin subunits of influenzaviruses are composed of two pairs of light and heavy polypeptide chains and it was found that the amino acid sequence of the light and heavy chains from the haemagglutinin subunits of the Hong Kong virus differed remarkably from those of the preceding A/Asian strains. These findings suggest that Hong Kong virus did not arise by mutation from a pre-existing human strain and that it probably arose by the selection of a genetic recombinant in a partially immune population. It is postulated that the recombinant was formed as the result of the mixed infection of an animal or bird with an animal or avian influenzavirus and a human A/Asian strain. The animal (or avian) virus could have donated the haemagglutinin subunits of A/Hong Kong/1/68 virus and the neuraminidase subunits could have come from the human A/Asian strain.",,R G Webster;W G Laver

Because schoolchildren are 1 of the most important sources of community-wide transmission of influenza, vaccinating them could have a major effect on reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults. Stochastic modeling shows that a vaccination rate as low as 20% in schoolchildren reduces overall mortality in adults aged ≥64 years more effectively than a vaccination rate of 90% for older adults. Additional modeling shows that vaccinating schoolchildren against influenza is optimal for reducing morbidity and mortality caused by influenza in the overall population. Although supported by simulated models, the benefits of mass vaccination need to be confirmed in a real-world setting. The best way to demonstrate the effectiveness of mass vaccination of schoolchildren is to implement the process in several localities in several states by using properly designed studies that incorporate accurate viral surveillance with at least 10 pairs of intervention and comparison populations.",,Ira M Longini Jr

We obtained data on the timing of 19 classes of NPI in 17 U.S. cities during the 1918 pandemic and tested the hypothesis that early implementation of multiple interventions was associated with reduced disease transmission. Consistent with this hypothesis, cities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic had peak death rates approximately 50% lower than those that did not and had less-steep epidemic curves. Cities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic also showed a trend toward lower cumulative excess mortality, but the difference was smaller (approximately 20%) and less statistically significant than that for peak death rates. This finding was not unexpected, given that few cities maintained NPIs longer than 6 weeks in 1918. Early implementation of certain interventions, including closure of schools, churches, and theaters, was associated with lower peak death rates, but no single intervention showed an association with improved aggregate outcomes for the 1918 phase of the pandemic. These findings support the hypothesis that rapid implementation of multiple NPIs can significantly reduce influenza transmission, but that viral spread will be renewed upon relaxation of such measures.",,Richard J Hatchett;Carter E Mecher;Marc Lipsitch

Drawing on two surveys conducted by Britain's Local Government Board (LGB), the paper shows how, in a pre-virological era, the board was able to establish that influenza was an intensely infectious disease. Its key observation, however, was that Russian influenza had taken the form of three, and possibly four, distinct waves of infection, with the second wave in the spring of 1891 proving more lethal than the first wave, and the third wave in the winter of 1892 proving almost as lethal again. Most of this mortality was due to excess deaths from respiratory disease, particularly in the middle age ranges, but while these insights could and, arguably, should have aided the public health response, British health authorities preferred to advocate cautious preventive measures that did little to alleviate the pandemic's impact. The policy would prove especially costly in 1918-1919 when the LGB missed the opportunity to provide extra nursing cover for influenza convalescents following the initial summer wave of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic.",,Mark Honigsbaum

Besides its mortality the 1918 pandemic was unusual for several reasons. It preferentially killed young adults from 20 to 40 y with a peak mortality at age 28 y. Mortality was highly variable with death rates varying by at least 10 fold within similar groups of citizens, soldiers, cities and islands. Secondary bacterial pneumonia following influenza was the overwhelming cause of death and not viral pneumonitis or acute lung injury. Clinical expressions of the 1918 pandemic were unusual with bleeding into the respiratory tree including epistaxis and dark blue cyanotic skin. The 1918 influenza virus apparently ceased circulation in the human population in the early 1920s but continued to evolve in pigs. Immunizations using viruses from 1918 and 2009 can cross-protect laboratory animals even though the human mortality outcomes were very different between the first pandemics of the 20th and 21st centuries.

Recently, pulmonary edema was found at autopsy in 46% of 26 salicylate-intoxicated adults. Experimentally, salicylates increase lung fluid and protein levels and impair mucociliary clearance. In 1918, the US Surgeon General, the US Navy, and the Journal of the American Medical Association recommended use of aspirin just before the October death spike.

Three factors in particular are responsible for the severity of the disease: the cytocidal action of the virus--which, via hematogeneous spread, can involve not only the respiratory tract but also other organs such as the heart--, the immune response with fever and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and bacterial superinfection of the virally predamaged respiratory mucosa. A particular threat is posed by influenza pandemics, which are usually associated with extremely high mortality and morbidity rates. The development of pandemics is furthered by the potential of the viral genome to undergo a so-called shift, as a result of which a reservoir of, for example, avian influenza A viruses can give rise to subtypes that are a danger to humans, and against which there is initially no protection. While the deaths caused by an epidemic are to be seen largely among old and multimorbid people, a pandemic also endangers the health and life of young and healthy persons.",,W Lange

To investigate the most likely time at which a new successful strain emerges every year in seasonal influenza, we use an individual-based model that takes into account the seasonality in transmission rate and host cross-immunity against a current viral strain due to previous infections with other strains. Our model deals with antigenic evolution of influenza virus that originated by point mutations at amino acid sites that constitute epitope and is driven by host immune response. Under the range of parameters by which influenza virus shows a ""trunk"" shape in its phylogenetic tree, as is typical in influenza A virus evolution, we find that most successful mutant strains emerge in an early part of the epidemic season, and that the time when the number of infected hosts reaches a maximum tends to be more than one season after viral emergence.

Key factors to take into account are virus dynamics, particle release in relation to respiratory symptoms, the amount of virus shed and, importantly, how these vary between infected individuals. A quantitative understanding of the process of influenza transmission is relevant to designing effective mitigation measures. Here we develop an influenza infection dynamics model fitted to virological, systemic and respiratory symptoms to investigate how within-host dynamics relates to infectiousness. We show that influenza virus shedding is highly heterogeneous between subjects. From analysis of data on experimental infections, we find that a small proportion (<20%) of influenza infected individuals are responsible for the production of 95% of infectious particles. Our work supports targeting mitigation measures at most infectious subjects to efficiently reduce transmission. The effectiveness of public health interventions targeted at highly infectious individuals would depend on accurate identification of these subjects and on how quickly control measures can be applied.",,Laetitia Canini;Mark E J Woolhouse;Taronna R Maines;Fabrice Carrat
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22010534/,Live attenuated influenza vaccine--a review,"Owing to the variability of influenza viruses, vaccine composition needs to be up-dated annually. As many variables can influence their efficacy, vaccines are still considered ""sub-optimal"". Many studies have been carried out in recent years to improve vaccines. In particular, researchers and vaccine-producing corporations have focused on developing a live vaccine. Among the candidate vaccines, the strain developed by Maassab has recently been licensed in the USA and Europe, after extensive investigation. This vaccine is safe and well tolerated, and has shown very good genetic stability. Although vaccine recipients are able to spread the virus, transmission to close contacts is practically non-existent. Studies on cold-adapted attenuated influenza vaccines have demonstrated that such vaccines are effective, and sometimes more effective than inactivated influenza vaccines. Cold-adapted attenuated influenza vaccines therefore appear to be an important weapon against influenza. However, a more widespread use of these vaccines is to be recommended, especially in children, as the more acceptable way of administration can favour parental compliance.",,R Gasparini;D Amicizia;P L Lai;D Panatto

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18799808/,Evaluating the effectiveness of antiviral treatment in models for influenza pandemic,"We study the effectiveness of antiviral treatment in simple susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed models that are at the base of models used for influenza pandemic. The strategy is assessed in terms of the value of the reproductive ratio R(0). We consider a general framework and analyse six different specific cases. The same antiviral strategy is simulated in all models, but they slightly differ in the compartmental structure. These differences correspond to different underlying assumptions concerning the timing of the intervention and the selection of individuals who receive treatment. It is shown that these details can have a strong influence on the predicted effectiveness of the strategy: for instance, with R(0) = 1.8 in absence of treatment, different models predict that with treatment R(0) can become as low as 0.4 or as high as 1.3; still, in all models 70% of infected individuals are treated and the infectiousness of treated individuals is reduced by 80%. A particular assumption that can be included when modelling influenza is time-varying infectivity. We consider a specific model to verify if the predicted effectiveness of antiviral treatment is influenced by the inclusion of this assumption. We compare the results obtained with constant and variable infectivity, in relation also to the time of intervention. It is likely that existing differences in the predictions of the effect of control measures depend on such modelling details. This finding stresses the need for carefully defining the structure of models in order to obtain results useful for policymakers in pandemic planning.",,Antonella Lunelli;Andrea Pugliese

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22851649/,Clonal interference in the evolution of influenza,"The seasonal influenza A virus undergoes rapid evolution to escape human immune response. Adaptive changes occur primarily in antigenic epitopes, the antibody-binding domains of the viral hemagglutinin. This process involves recurrent selective sweeps, in which clusters of simultaneous nucleotide fixations in the hemagglutinin coding sequence are observed about every 4 years. Here, we show that influenza A (H3N2) evolves by strong clonal interference. This mode of evolution is a red queen race between viral strains with different beneficial mutations. Clonal interference explains and quantifies the observed sweep pattern: we find an average of at least one strongly beneficial amino acid substitution per year, and a given selective sweep has three to four driving mutations on average. The inference of selection and clonal interference is based on frequency time series of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which are obtained from a sample of influenza genome sequences over 39 years. Our results imply that mode and speed of influenza evolution are governed not only by positive selection within, but also by background selection outside antigenic epitopes: immune adaptation and conservation of other viral functions interfere with each other. Hence, adapting viral proteins are predicted to be particularly brittle. We conclude that a quantitative understanding of influenza's evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics must be based on all genomic domains and functions coupled by clonal interference.",,Natalja Strelkowa;Michael Lässig

Pandemic-level control measures must be carefully assessed specially in resource-limited situations. A model for the transmission dynamics of influenza is used to evaluate the impact of isolation and/or antiviral drug delivery measures during an influenza pandemic. Five pre-selected control strategies involving antiviral treatment and isolation are tested under the ""unlimited"" resource assumption followed by an exploration of the impact of these ""optimal"" policies when resources are limited in the context of a 1918-type influenza pandemic scenario. The implementation of antiviral treatment at the start of a pandemic tends to reduce the magnitude of epidemic peaks, spreading the maximal impact of an outbreak over an extended window in time. Hence, the controls' timing and intensity can reduce the pressures placed on the health care infrastructure by a pandemic reducing the stress put on the system during epidemic peaks.

On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization declared that a global pandemic of influenza A H1N1 was underway. This action was a reflection of the spread of the new H1N1 virus, not the severity of illness caused by the virus. As of October, 2009, there are about 400,000 confirmed cases and 5000 mortalities due to pandemic H1N1 all over the world. The symptoms are usually mild: fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, and they usually disappear spontaneously within 3-7 days. Recommendations suggest staying at home with mild symptoms, and avoiding the contact with other people. In case of warning signs of complications or emergency symptoms, medical care is required, and antiviral treatment, hospitalization might be needed. The most important duty against pandemic H1N1 is prevention, which means first of all the adherence of hygienic rules and the use of vaccination. Based on epidemiologic data and worldwide experiences on influenza vaccination, both seasonal and H1N1 vaccinations are recommended for anyone 6 months of age or older who is at risk of becoming ill or of transmitting the viruses to others.

Although a single virus strain probably affected all the islands, mortality varied from less than 0·1% in Tasmania, to 22% in Western Samoa.

Using a compartmental model with age structure and vaccination status, we examined the effect of age specific scheduling of vaccination during a pandemic influenza outbreak, when there is a race between the vaccination campaign and the dynamics of the pandemic. Our results agree with some recent studies on that age specificity is paramount to vaccination planning. However, little is known about the effectiveness of such control measures when they are applied during the outbreak. Comparing five possible strategies, we found that age specific scheduling can have a huge impact on the outcome of the epidemic. For the best scheme, the attack rates were up to 10% lower than for other strategies. We demonstrate the importance of early start of the vaccination campaign, since ten days delay may increase the attack rate by up to 6%.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/604116/,Use of influenza vaccine in non-high risk populations,"The aim of most strategies for vaccination against influenza is the prevention of mortality. Since individuals in the high risk group are mainly elderly, and the elderly have a low frequency of influenza infection, this strategy can have no significant controlling effect on morbidity. It has been shown in the longitudinal community study in Tecumseh, Michigan that highest frequency of infection with influenza is seen in the school-age population; this pattern is quite marked for type B influenza and less so for type A. In addition, it was possible in 1968-69 to show that vaccination of schoolchildren with an inactivated H3N2 vaccine resulted in a three-fold reduction in the attack rate for the entire community. Because of a number of problems in use of inactive vaccines, including the need for parenteral administration, it is unlikely that such preparations could be used regularly on this large a scale. However, it would be entirely feasible for live virus vaccines to be employed in such a manner. The use of more extensive vaccination would have an additional beneficial effect, since it has recently been shown in Tecumseh that a relationship may well exist between frequent respiratory infections and the development of chronic bronchitis in apparently healthy individuals.",,A S Monto;H F Maassab

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20307340/,"Age, influenza pandemics and disease dynamics","The world is currently confronting the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century [caused by a novel pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus]. Earlier pandemics have been characterized by age distributions that are distinct from those observed with seasonal influenza epidemics, with higher attack rates (and correspondingly increased proportionate or relative mortality) in younger individuals. While the genesis of protection against infection in older individuals during a pandemic is uncertain, differential vulnerability to infection by age has important implications for disease dynamics and control, and for choice of optimal vaccination strategies. Age-related vulnerability to infection may explain differences between school- and community-derived estimates of the reproductive number (R) for a newly emerged pandemic strain, and may also help explain the failure of a newly emerged influenza A (H1N1) virus strain to cause a pandemic in 1977. Age-related factors may also help explain variability in attack rates, and the size and impact of influenza epidemics across jurisdictions and between populations. In Canada, such effects have been observed in the apparently increased severity of outbreaks on Indigenous peoples' reserves. The implications of these patterns for vaccine allocation necessitate targeted research to understand age-related vulnerabilities early in an influenza pandemic.",,A L Greer;A Tuite;D N Fisman
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10738677/,Influenza,"Influenza is an acute respiratory illness of global importance that causes considerable morbidity and mortality every year. At the beginning of the millennium, influenza will still be an emergent or re-emergent infection because of the viral ability to mutate. Global influenza surveillance indicates that influenza viruses may vary within a country and between countries and continents during an influenza season. Virologic surveillance is of critical importance in monitoring antigenic shift and drift. Disease surveillance is important in assessing the impact of the epidemics. Both types of information provide the basis of vaccine composition and the correct use of antivirals. Laboratory diagnosis is of critical importance for the global surveillance of influenza and may allow the timely use of antiviral drugs. Viral isolation remains the gold standard for laboratory diagnosis; however, several new rapid diagnostic tests are available or in development. The clinical spectrum of the disease varies from asymptomatic infection to the classic flu syndrome, and respiratory and nonrespiratory complications are observed particularly in high-risk groups. Current inactivated influenza vaccines have shown efficacy and effectiveness in preventing influenzalike illness, hospitalization for pneumonia, and death and in reducing health care costs. Because of the annual administration of the vaccine and the short period of time where it can be administered, strategies directed at improving vaccine coverage are of critical importance. In this sense, experiences obtained in different countries, such as with the National Immunization Campaigns developed in Argentina, provide one model of massive vaccine administration. In addition to current vaccines, new live attenuated vaccines will permit a most effective prevention of influenza in the community in the near future. A new type of antiviral, neuraminidase inhibitors, offers valuable benefits in the prevention and treatment of influenza A and B. A future pandemic of influenza seems inevitable. There is wide recognition that preparation for the next pandemic requires that infrastructure be in place during interpandemic periods for implementing preventive and therapeutic measures. The WHO has established a pandemic influenza task force, and a number of countries in Latin America have developed formal pandemic plans.

We construct a mathematical model of aerosol (i.e., droplet-nuclei) and contact transmission of influenza within a household containing one infected. An analysis of this model in conjunction with influenza and rhinovirus data suggests that aerosol transmission is far more dominant than contact transmission for influenza. We also consider a separate model of a close expiratory event, and find that a close cough is unlikely ( approximately 1% probability) to generate traditional droplet transmission (i.e., direct deposition on the mucous membranes), although a close, unprotected and horizontally-directed sneeze is potent enough to cause droplet transmission. There are insufficient data on the frequency of close expiratory events to assess the relative importance of aerosol transmission and droplet transmission, and it is prudent to leave open the possibility that droplet transmission is important until proven otherwise. However, the rarity of close, unprotected and horizontally-directed sneezes-coupled with the evidence of significant aerosol and contact transmission for rhinovirus and our comparison of hazard rates for rhinovirus and influenza-leads us to suspect that aerosol transmission is the dominant mode of transmission for influenza.",,Michael P Atkinson;Lawrence M Wein

Contribution of recent modelling exercises synthesis prepared by the InVS/Inserm ""epidemiology"" group - November 2005]","The growing threat of influenza pandemic has lead many countries to stockpile specific antiviral drugs, mainly oseltamivir, as it can be used both for prophylaxis and therapy. Several recently published studies, based on mathematical modelling, have assessed the impact of a large scale use of this drug to contain an emerging pandemic, slow its spread within a country or reduce its epidemiological impact. They conclude that ring antiviral prophylaxis around the first cases, combined with social distancing measures, may halt a nascent pandemic, if the human-to-human transmissibility of the virus is limited and the control measures implemented promptly and with a high coverage. In case of failure, these same strategies could delay the spread of the virus within a country. The use of influenza antiviral drugs would reduce the burden of disease and even the clinical attack rate, under the assumption of a shorter infectious period for treated patients. These studies are in favour of stockpiling influenza antiviral drugs, at least to cover the curative needs and, even better, to contribute to the global effort to contain an emergent pandemic and to allow an intervention around the first chains of indigenous transmission in a country, thus slowing the virus spread. These results are based on the hypothesis of the effectiveness of oseltamivir on the pandemic virus and confirm the critical importance of a sensitive and reactive surveillance.",,D Lévy-Bruhl

This is a question of intense debate over the last 5 years, though the history of such experiments goes back at least to the synthesis of viable influenza A H1N1 (1918) based on material preserved from the 1918 pandemic. This chapter makes the case that experiments to create potential pandemic pathogens (PPPs) are nearly unique in that they present biosafety risks that extend well beyond the experimenter or laboratory performing them; an accidental release could, as the name suggests, lead to global spread of a virulent virus, a biosafety incident on a scale never before seen. In such cases, biosafety considerations should be uppermost in the consideration of alternative approaches to experimental objectives and design, rather than being settled after the fact, as is appropriately done for most research involving pathogens. The extensive recent discussion of the magnitude of risks from such experiments is briefly reviewed. The chapter argues that, while there are indisputably certain questions that can be answered only by gain-of-function experiments in highly pathogenic strains, these questions are narrow and unlikely to meaningfully advance public health goals such as vaccine production and pandemic prediction. Alternative approaches to experimental influenza virology and characterization of existing strains are in general completely safe, higher throughput, more generalizable, and less costly than creation of PPP in the laboratory and can thereby better inform public health. Indeed, virtually every finding of recent PPP experiments that has been cited for its public health value was predated by similar findings using safe methodologies. The chapter concludes that the unique scientific and public health value of PPP experiments is inadequate to justify the unique risks they entail and that researchers would be well-advised to turn their talents to other methodologies that will be safe and more rewarding scientifically.",Evolution; Ferret; Gain-of-function; Influenza; Passage; Potential pandemic pathogen; Selection; Transmissibility; Virulence.,Marc Lipsitch

Agent-based models are increasingly being recognized as the next generation of epidemiological models. In this research, we use the ability of agent-based models to incorporate behavior into simulations by examining the relative importance of vaccination and social distancing, two common measures for controlling the spread of infectious diseases, with respect to seasonal influenza. We modeled health behaviour using the result of a Health Belief Model study focused on influenza. We considered a control and a treatment group to explore the effect of education on people's health-related behaviors patterns. The control group reflects the behavioral patterns of students based on their general knowledge of influenza and its interventions while the treatment group illustrates the level of behavioral changes after individuals have been educated by a health care expert. The results of this study indicate that self-initiated behaviors are successful in controlling an outbreak in a high contact rate location such as a university. Self-initiated behaviors resulted in a population attack rate decrease of 17% and a 25% reduction in the peak number of cases.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17476782/,How generation intervals shape the relationship between growth rates and reproductive numbers,"Mathematical models of transmission have become invaluable management tools in planning for the control of emerging infectious diseases. A key variable in such models is the reproductive number R. For new emerging infectious diseases, the value of the reproductive number can only be inferred indirectly from the observed exponential epidemic growth rate r. Such inference is ambiguous as several different equations exist that relate the reproductive number to the growth rate, and it is unclear which of these equations might apply to a new infection. Here, we show that these different equations differ only with respect to their assumed shape of the generation interval distribution. Therefore, the shape of the generation interval distribution determines which equation is appropriate for inferring the reproductive number from the observed growth rate. We show that by assuming all generation intervals to be equal to the mean, we obtain an upper bound to the range of possible values that the reproductive number may attain for a given growth rate. Furthermore, we show that by taking the generation interval distribution equal to the observed distribution, it is possible to obtain an empirical estimate of the reproductive number.",,J Wallinga;M Lipsitch
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19284639/,"Influenza virus antigenic variation, host antibody production and new approach to control epidemics","Influenza is an infectious disease and can lead to life-threatening complications like pneumonia. The disease is caused by three types of RNA viruses called influenza types A, B and C, each consisting of eight negative single-stranded RNA-segments encoding 11 proteins. Current annual vaccines contain two type A strains and one type B strain and are capable of inducing strong antibody responses to both the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin and the neuraminidase. While these vaccines are protective against vaccine viruses they are not effective against newly emerging viruses that contain antigenic variations known as antigenic drift and shift. In nature, environmental selection pressure generally plays a key role in selecting antigenic changes in the antigen determining spots of hemagglutinin, resulting in changes in the antigenicity of the virus. Recently, a new technology has been developed where influenza-specific IgG+ antibody-secreting plasma cells can be isolated and cloned directly from vaccinated humans and high affinity monoclonal antibodies can be produced within several weeks after vaccination. The new technology holds great promise for the development of effective passive antibody therapy to limit the spread of influenza viruses in a timely manner.",,Jiezhong Chen;Yi-Mo Deng

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18801714/,Improving the realism of deterministic multi-strain models: implications for modelling influenza A,"Understanding the interaction between epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics for antigenically variable pathogens remains a challenge, particularly if analytical insight is wanted. In particular, while a variety of relatively complex simulation models have reproduced the evolutionary dynamics of influenza, simpler models have given less satisfying descriptions of the patterns seen in data. Here, we develop a set of relatively simple deterministic models of the transmission dynamics of multi-strain pathogens which give increased biological realism compared with past work. We allow the intensity of cross-immunity generated against one strain given exposure to a different strain to depend on the extent of genetic difference between the strains. We show that the dynamics of this model are determined by the interplay of parameters defining the cross-immune response function and can include fully symmetric equilibria, self-organized strain structures, regular periodic and chaotic regimes. We then extend the model by incorporating transient strain-transcending immunity that acts as a density-dependent mechanism to lower overall infection prevalence and thus pathogen diversity. We conclude that while some aspects of the evolution of influenza can be captured by deterministic models, overall, the description obtainable using a purely deterministic framework is unsatisfactory, implying that stochasticity of strain generation (via mutation) and extinction needs to be captured to appropriately capture influenza dynamics.",,Pavlo Minayev;Neil Ferguson
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11241802/,Planning for the next pandemic of influenza,"Worldwide influenza pandemics have occurred at irregular and unpredictable intervals throughout history and it is confidently expected that they will continue to occur in the future. It is now recognised that these pandemics result when avian influenza A viruses succeed in adaptation to and transmission between humans. The impact of pandemic influenza is substantial in terms of morbidity, mortality and economic cost and there is the potential for serious social disruption. Influenza vaccines remain the most effective defence against influenza but will be in short supply during a pandemic, as will the new specific anti-influenza drugs, due to the lead-time required for production and rapid spread of the virus. To minimise the impact of pandemics it is imperative to maximise the availability of both vaccines and antivirals and to ensure that they are used optimally. This requires planning at both the international and national levels. The World Health Organization has, therefore, developed a staged plan for responding to a pandemic threat which is based principally on its surveillance program. It has also prepared guidelines to assist national agencies in their planning.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20022897/,How necessary is a fast testkit for mitigation of pandemic flu?,"It is widely feared that a novel, highly pathogenic, human transmissible influenza virus may evolve that could cause the next global pandemic. Mitigating the spread of such an influenza pandemic would require not only the timely administration of antiviral drugs to those infected, but also the implementation of suitable intervention policies for stunting the spread of the virus. Towards this end, mathematical modelling and simulation studies are crucial as they allow us to evaluate the predicted effectiveness of the various intervention policies before enforcing them. Diagnosis plays a vital role in the overall pandemic management framework by detecting and distinguishing the pathogenic strain from the less threatening seasonal strains and other influenza-like illnesses. This allows treatment and intervention to be deployed effectively, given limited antiviral supplies and other resources. However, the time required to design a fast and accurate testkit for novel strains may limit the role of diagnosis. Herein, we aim to investigate the cost and effectiveness of different diagnostic methods using a stochastic agent-based city-scale model, and then address the issue of whether conventional testing approaches, when used with appropriate intervention policies, can be as effective as fast testkits in containing a pandemic outbreak. We found that for mitigation purposes, fast and accurate testkits are not necessary as long as sufficient medication is given, and are generally recommended only when used with extensive contact tracing and prophylaxis. Additionally, in the event of insufficient medication and fast testkits, the use of slower, conventional testkits together with proper isolation policies while waiting for the diagnostic results can be an equally effective substitute.",,Juxin Chin;Geoffrey Koh;Dong-Yup Lee

To explore how drug usage by individuals affects population strain dynamics, we embedded a two-strain model of within-host dynamics within an epidemic model. We found that when 40% of hosts took drugs early during the infectious period, transmission was reduced by 30% and average levels of immunity by 2·9-fold (comparable to antibody concentrations), relative to 14% and 1·5-fold reductions when drugs were taken late.

Many also fear ""side effects"" even though the influenza vaccine rarely induces severe influenza-like illness (ILI) much less any other side effects. Some people feel that it is simply not worth getting vaccinated since they only catch the flu once every 10 years. The probability of being infected by the virus can be quite high for some groups, however,and the consequences of infection - debilitating illness, loss of mobility, secondary infections - can be particularly severe for high-risk groups.

Seasonal fluctuation of transmissibility and epidemiological interference between the two major influenza B lineages make the lineage dynamics complicated. Here we construct a parsimonious model describing the lineage dynamics while taking into account seasonal fluctuation of transmissibility and epidemiological interference. Using this model we estimated the epidemiological and evolutional parameters with the time-series data of the lineage specific isolates in Japan from the 2010-2011 season to the 2014-2015 season. The basic reproduction number is similar between Victoria and Yamagata, with a minimum value during one year as 0.82 (95% highest posterior density (HPD): 0.77-0.87) for the Yamagata and 0.83 (95% HPD: 0.74-0.92) for Victoria, the amplitude of seasonal variation of the basic reproduction number is 0.77 (95% HPD:0.66-0.87) for Yamagata and 1.05 (95% HPD: 0.89-1.02) for Victoria. The duration for which the acquired immunity is effective against infection by the Yamagata lineage is shorter than the acquired immunity for Victoria, 424.1days (95% HPD:317.4-561.5days). The reduction rate of susceptibility due to immune cross-reaction is 0.51 (95% HPD: 0.084-0.92) for the immunity obtained from the infection with Yamagata against the infection with Victoria and 0.62 (95% HPD: 0.42-0.80) for the immunity obtained from the infection with Victoria against the infection with Yamagata. Using estimated parameters, we predicted the dominant lineage in 2015-2016 season. The accuracy of this prediction is 68.8% if the emergence timings of the two lineages are known and 61.4% if the emergence timings are unknown. Estimated seasonal variation of the lineage specific reproduction number can narrow down the range of emergence timing, with an accuracy of 64.6% if the emergence times are assumed to be the time at which the estimated reproduction number exceeds one.",,Mayumbo Nyirenda;Ryosuke Omori;Heidi L Tessmer;Hiroki Arimura;Kimihito Ito

This article discusses Spanish flu in Norway between 1918-19 from three different approaches. How did Spanish flu affect Norway? Spanish flu was probably imported to Norway across the North Sea from Britain. From the middle of June 1918, Spanish flu swept across the country in three different waves: the summer epidemic of 1918, the autumn epidemic of 1918 and the winter epidemic of 1918-19. In Norway 13,000-15,000 died, most of them during the autumn of 1918 and mostly from pneumonia or pulmonary complications. What were the consequences? Most deaths occurred in young adults; many families experienced tragedies. Spanish flu is considered the worst demographic crisis of the twentieth century. The additional costs to the public purse were huge after the epidemic. Why was it that Spanish flu had such devastating effects? The virus causing the pandemic was very virulent and resulted in a higher mortality rate than that experienced during other pandemics. These characteristics may be explained by genetic features of the 1918 virus. This article points at conditions in Norway at the time of Spanish flu that may have contributed to the severity of the outbreak.",,T Borza

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18401408/,Estimating the impact of school closure on influenza transmission from Sentinel data,"The threat posed by the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus requires public health authorities to prepare for a human pandemic. Although pre-pandemic vaccines and antiviral drugs might significantly reduce illness rates, their stockpiling is too expensive to be practical for many countries. Consequently, alternative control strategies, based on non-pharmaceutical interventions, are a potentially attractive policy option. School closure is the measure most often considered. The high social and economic costs of closing schools for months make it an expensive and therefore controversial policy, and the current absence of quantitative data on the role of schools during influenza epidemics means there is little consensus on the probable effectiveness of school closure in reducing the impact of a pandemic. Here, from the joint analysis of surveillance data and holiday timing in France, we quantify the role of schools in influenza epidemics and predict the effect of school closure during a pandemic. We show that holidays lead to a 20-29% reduction in the rate at which influenza is transmitted to children, but that they have no detectable effect on the contact patterns of adults. Holidays prevent 16-18% of seasonal influenza cases (18-21% in children). By extrapolation, we find that prolonged school closure during a pandemic might reduce the cumulative number of cases by 13-17% (18-23% in children) and peak attack rates by up to 39-45% (47-52% in children). The impact of school closure would be reduced if it proved difficult to maintain low contact rates among children for a prolonged period.",,Simon Cauchemez;Alain-Jacques Valleron;Pierre-Yves Boëlle;Antoine Flahault;Neil M Ferguson

The program was stopped after cases of Guillain-Barré Syndrome were identified following vaccination and when no spread of the virus occurred beyond Fort Dix.

We seek to determine the bias of TN-based VE estimates during a pandemic using a dynamic probability model. The model is used to evaluate and compare the bias of VE estimates under various sources of bias when vaccination occurs after the beginning of an outbreak, such as during a pandemic. The model includes two covariates (health status and health awareness), which may affect the probabilities of vaccination, developing influenza and non-influenza acute respiratory illness (ARI), and seeking medical care. Specifically, we evaluate the bias of VE estimates when (1) vaccination affects the probability of developing a non-influenza ARI; (2) vaccination affects the probability of seeking medical care; (3) a covariate (e.g. health status) is related to both the probabilities of vaccination and developing an ARI; and (4) a covariate (e.g. health awareness) is related to both the probabilities of vaccination and of seeking medical care. We considered two outcomes against which the vaccine is supposed to protect: symptomatic influenza and medically-attended influenza. When vaccination begins during an outbreak, we found that the effect of delayed onset of vaccination is unpredictable. VE estimates from TN studies were biased regardless of the source of bias present. However, if the core assumption of the TN design is satisfied, that is, if vaccination does not affect the probability of non-influenza ARI, then TN-based VE estimates against medically-attended influenza will only suffer from small (<0.05) to moderate bias (≥0.05 and <0.10).

Thus, new epidemics and pandemics are likely to occur in the future, and eradication of the disease will be difficult to achieve. Although it is not clear whether a new pandemic is imminent, it would be prudent to take into account the lessons we have learned from studying different human and animal influenza viruses. Specifically, reconstruction of the genes of the 1918 pandemic virus and studies on their contribution to virulence will be important steps toward understanding the biological capabilities of this lethal virus. Increasing the availability of new antiviral drugs and developing superior vaccines will provide us with better approaches to control influenza and to have a positive impact on disease load. A concern is that the imposition of new rules for working with infectious influenza viruses under high security and high containment conditions will stifle scientific progress. The complex questions of what makes an influenza virus transmissible from one human to another and from one species to another, as well as how the immune system interacts with the virus, will require the active collaboration and unencumbered work of many scientific groups.",,Peter Palese

A number of factors, including World War I, contributed to the spread of the pandemic virus, which often caused high symptomatic attack rates and severe illness. Major achievements over the last 100 years have been made in influenza prevention, diagnosis, and treatment; however, the potential for a severe pandemic to emerge remains unchanged. We provide a review of the historical context and clinical aspects of illness due to the influenza A(H1N1) virus as it emerged and spread in 1918, with a focus on the experience in the United States. Understanding the significant social disruption and burden of illness from the 1918 pandemic can help us imagine the possible impacts of a high severity pandemic if it were to emerge now.",Epidemiology; Influenza virus; Pandemic.,Barbara Jester;Timothy M Uyeki;Daniel B Jernigan;Terrence M Tumpey

The Saudi Arabian authority successfully organized the Hajj 2009 amidst fear of pandemic influenza. While severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was rare, the true burden of pandemic influenza at Hajj that year remains speculative. In this article we review the latest evidence on influenza control and discuss our experience of influenza and its prevention at Hajj and possible application to other mass gatherings. Depending on study design the attack rate of seasonal influenza at Hajj has ranged from 6% in polymerase chain reaction or culture confirmed studies to 38% in serological surveillance. No significant effect of influenza vaccine or the use of personal protective measures against influenza has been established from observational studies, although the uptake of the vaccine and adherence to face masks and hand hygiene has been low. In all, there is a relatively poor evidence base for control of influenza. Until better evidence is obtained, vaccination coupled with rapid antiviral treatment of symptomatic individuals remains the mainstay of prevention at Hajj and other mass gatherings. Hajj pilgrimage provides a unique opportunity to test the effectiveness of various preventive measures that require a large sample size, such as testing the efficacy of plain surgical masks against laboratory-confirmed influenza. After successful completion of a pilot trial conducted among Australian pilgrims at the 2011 Hajj, a large multinational cluster randomized controlled trial is being planned.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6246153/,"Influenza: epidemiology, etiology, immunization and management","Influenza, an acute contagious respiratory infection caused by orthomyxoviruses A, B, and C, occurs in local outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics. Differences in the morphology and antigen patterns for these viruses account for the differences in virulence and immunity. Influenza A is virulent, B is mild, and C is nonvirulent. Swine influenza virus may spread from swine to man (recycling of human A virus), causing epidemics and pandemics. The 1976-77 influenza vaccination program involved swine virus, and was associated with 321 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome and a mortality of 5 percent. Subsequent yearly programs with other types of vaccine are described. Dosages vary according to the age of the vaccinee. Those who need vaccination include persons over 65 years of age, patients with heart/lung, liver/lung or metabolic diseases, severe anemia, or a compromised antigenic system. Side effects include local reaction, fever, an allergic reaction (due to egg protein), and the Guillain-Barré syndrome (only with swine virus vaccine). In general, influenza vaccine is safe and confers 60-85 percent protection. Since immunity lasts only about a year, annual vaccination with recently isolated virus vaccine is recommended.

Several International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) groupings were used for both hospitalisation and mortality estimates, including influenza and pneumonia, other respiratory disorders, and circulatory disorders. For Australians aged 50-64 years, the annual excess hospitalisations attributable to influenza were 33.3 (95%CI: 23.2-43.4) per 100,000 for influenza and pneumonia and 57.6 (95%CI: 32.5-82.8) per 100,000 for other respiratory disorders.

We found that precautionary behaviors even among a minority of the population can have a decisive effect on the probability of the outbreak to propagate. The results also display that assumptions strongly influences the outcome.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18947519/,The scientific basis for offering seasonal influenza immunisation to risk groups in Europe,"This paper summarises the scientific evidence supporting selection of risk groups that would benefit from annual seasonal influenza immunisation in European Union (EU) countries. Risk groups are defined restrictively as persons in Europe at higher than average risk of adverse outcomes should they be infected with seasonal influenza and for whom use of vaccine is demonstrated to be effective in reducing the risk of those outcomes. Existing evidence indicate that older people and those with chronic disease are at higher risk of severe adverse outcome and that immunisation reduces this risk. There is thus good scientific evidence for routinely offering annual immunisation to all older people (at least those aged 65 years and older), and people with certain groups of chronic medical conditions. We estimated that these two groups account for between 19% and 28% of the population of EU countries. Thus in 2006, an estimated 84 million older people aged 65 years and over and 41 million people younger than 65 years of age with chronic conditions were living in these countries. There is also strong evidence for immunising staff caring for patients belonging to these two risk groups in residential (care home) settings in order to protect the patients. There are as yet no strong data on whether or not immunising other healthcare workers and carers protect patients though immunisation of healthcare workers can be justified on occupational health grounds. At present the scientific evidence for immunising other suggested risk groups, notably children and pregnant women is not strong for Europe though equally there is no evidence against immunising these groups.",,A Nicoll;Bc Ciancio;S Tsolova;Pr Blank;C Yilmaz
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22357982/,Behaviour and control of influenza in institutions and small societies,"A literature review was undertaken to assess the impact of influenza in enclosed societies. The literature spanned 120 years and included both readily accessible material from online keyword searches, as well as more obscure paper documents found through in-depth library research. Enclosed societies have been predominantly found in some type of institution through this period although noticeable similarities exist in communities isolated by distance and geography. We observe that no matter how isolated a community is, it is not necessarily insulated from infection by influenza and that even where there are no complicating factors, such as the age distribution or the presence of individuals with greater susceptibility in the enclosed population, their organization tends to increase influenza transmission and the risk of secondary infection. The collected accounts demonstrate important features of outbreaks in such societies and the necessity of considering them in pandemic planning: in particular, rapid intervention is essential for the control of influenza spread in such circumstances. Recent experience has shown that administration of modern antiviral drugs, such as neuraminidase inhibitors are effective at moderating outbreaks of influenza, but only in combination with other methods of control. In more remote communities where such drugs are not, or less, readily available, and medical care is limited, such outbreaks can still pose particular difficulties. In all cases delay in correct diagnosis, detection of an outbreak or the implementation of control measures can result in the majority of the enclosed population succumbing to the disease.",,Thomas James Ronald Finnie;Ian M Hall;Steve Leach

In mitigating pandemic influenza, effective allocation of limited health resources also plays a critical role along with effective use of medical prevention and treatment procedures. A national resource allocation program for prevention and treatment must be supported with the right allocation decisions for all regions and population risk groups. In this study, we develop a multi-objective mathematical programming model for optimal resource allocation decisions in a country where a serious risk of pandemic influenza may exist. These resources include monetary budget for antivirals and preventive vaccinations, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, ventilators, and non-intensive care unit (non-ICU) beds. The mathematical model has three objectives: minimization of number of deaths, number of cases and total morbidity days during a pandemic influenza. This model can be used as a decision support tool by decision makers to assess the impact of different scenarios such as attack rates, hospitalization and death ratios.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18955890/,The global state of influenza in children,"Recent data concerning influenza-related hospitalization rates, deaths, outpatient visits, and drug consumption in otherwise healthy children have shown that childhood influenza is significantly more important than once believed. In addition to its clinical importance, influenza in healthy children can have substantial socioeconomic consequences for children, whose everyday activities are disrupted and who lose a significant number of school days, and their household contacts, who are frequently affected by similar illnesses. An overall evaluation of these data show that influenza in infants and children is a significant clinical and socioeconomic problem and that healthy children appear to be candidates for yearly vaccinations. Global evaluation of the impact of influenza in pediatric patients indicates that influenza vaccination should be more widely used than is usually recommended. All of the data regarding influenza vaccines indicate that the immunogenicity of the available preparations is good, and that they are safe, well-tolerated, and significantly effective in preventing influenza illness and its complications in both high-risk and otherwise healthy children. Moreover, the economic data indicate that universal childhood influenza vaccination is a low-cost preventive intervention that provides health benefits during epidemic and pandemic periods, supporting an extensive use of vaccination in childhood.",,Susanna Esposito;Paola Marchisio;Nicola Principi
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18573297/,The effect of misclassification on evaluating the effectiveness of influenza vaccines,"Misclassification is a measurement error and can be considered a type of information bias. Misclassification can occur at both exposure and outcome levels. Nondifferential misclassification causes only a dilution effect leading to underestimation, whereas differential misclassification can have more complicated and serious consequences. To avoid nondifferential diagnosis misclassification, it is necessary to use highly specific diagnostic examinations or criteria such as virus detection to exclude 'false positive' cases, and to limit the observation period to an intensive epidemic period if using less specific diagnostic criteria such as symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) or absence from school or workplace. To avoid differential diagnosis misclassification, vaccinated and unvaccinated groups must be equally scrutinized, and such scrutiny is more important than the specificity of diagnosis. So, passive findings from patients with influenza at clinics can cause complicated differential misclassification despite use of highly specific diagnostic procedures because vaccinated and unvaccinated patients may participate differently. Also important is standardization of diagnostic procedure that vaccination anamnesis does not influence diagnosis of influenza, or examination of the influence. Exposure misclassification would mainly underestimate vaccine effectiveness in most situations. Consequently, misclassification of diagnosis, especially differential misclassification, affects evaluation of influenza vaccine effectiveness.",,Kotaro Ozasa

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10623373/,Influenza. The role of burden-of-illness research,"Influenza is associated with a significant economic burden on both society and the individual, resulting in considerable healthcare costs and loss of productivity, as well as intangible costs such as suffering, grief and social disruption. The incidence and severity of influenza infection depend, at least in part, on the age and health status of the population. For example, the incidence of influenza is relatively high among children and young adults, but serious complications are much more likely to occur among the very young (< 1 year of age) and the elderly (> 65 years of age). School absenteeism tends to peak in the first half of a typical 6- to 8-week influenza epidemic, followed by workplace absenteeism in the latter half as school-aged children pass the infection to family members. Cost-of-illness studies are used by policy-makers to justify budgets and set priorities for prevention programmes, research and other expenditures. On the basis of German Sickness Fund data, recent estimates indicate that the cost of an influenza epidemic in that country is approximately 2 billion Deutschmarks (approximately $US1.4 billion). The bulk of these costs reflects indirect costs associated with lost productivity, a finding also noted in an earlier French cost-of-illness study of influenza. Thus, the main economic burden of influenza falls on infected individuals, their employers and their relatives. Methodology used in cost-of-illness studies can be quite variable. For example, two main approaches are used in measuring indirect costs (human capital and willingness to pay), although there is controversy as to which is the preferred method. Thus, investigators involved in cost-of-illness studies must be explicit regarding study methodology in order to allow for appropriate interpretation of study results by interested parties.",,T D Szucs

The new influenza A (H1N1) virus is genetically related to swine flu viruses, and differs substantially from circulating human influenza viruses. It is able to spread from person to person. Because it is a completely new virus, there is probably little immunity in the population. The course of the infection is relatively mild, but the virus will mutate and it is not yet certain whether this will affect severity of the influenza. General practitioners have an important role in surveillance and treatment. The Community Health Services must be notified of any patients who are suspected of having the new influenza.

In contrast to the last wave of 1965, it developed simultaneously with, or followed, an epidemic of influenza B. The epidemic spread of influenza was observed for a period of 2 years in the USSR; influenza B prevailed in 1966, influenza A2 in 1967, and the two viruses spread at different speeds. A slow spread and a gradual increase in intensity during most of the year was characteristic of influenza B while influenza A2 spread rapidly and involved a considerable part of the country within 3 months.Although the influenza B started to spread almost 9 months before influenza A2 became active, the periods of maximum intensity of both outbreaks coincided in most parts of the USSR in the winter of 1966-67. The approach of summer temporarily stopped the spread of influenza B but did not bring the outbreak to an end nor lessen the intensity of the next wave in the autumn. Among the haemagglutinating agents isolated in the USSR in 1966-67 were 121 strains of virus B and 132 strains of virus A2.

We examined the epidemiological patterns of human A/H5N1 cases, their possible explanations, and the plausibility of a host genetic effect on susceptibility to A/H5N1 infection. The preponderance of familial clustering of cases and the relative lack of non-familial clusters, the occurrence of related cases separated by time and place, and the paucity of cases in some highly exposed groups such as poultry cullers, are consistent with a host genetic effect. Animal models support the biological plausibility of genetic susceptibility to A/H5N1.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11303411/,Influenza. Cost of illness and considerations in the economic evaluation of new and emerging therapies,"Influenza infection has been a burden to humans for thousands of years. Despite the fact that epidemics could be predicted with regularity, the lack of available prevention or treatment measures left humankind vulnerable to the harmful effects of this ubiquitous virus. While the pandemics of 1918 and 1957 are recent examples of the devastation that influenza may inflict, even in a typical year influenza infection and related complications cause significant morbidity and mortality. The development of an influenza vaccine during the 1940s marked a major turning point in the management of this disease. Vaccination of the elderly and other high risk patients has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality and to be a worthwhile investment from an economic perspective. Despite these benefits, vaccine use in this group remains suboptimal. The role of annual vaccination for individuals at lower risk for influenza-related complications remains controversial. While prevention by vaccination is relatively straightforward, the treatment of symptomatic influenza-like illness with medication is more complicated. Differentiating symptoms caused by the influenza viruses from those caused by other common viruses is difficult. Currently available tests to document influenza as the cause of illness are either too expensive, too inaccurate or too time consuming to impact treatment. Symptom-based diagnosis remains the most commonly used strategy in clinical practice. The approval of the neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs)--zanamivir and oseltamivir--remind healthcare providers of the difficulties in diagnosing and treating influenza. NIs have been shown to reduce the duration of symptoms of individuals infected with influenza when prescribed within the first 2 days of symptoms. Whether these innovative agents are cost effective, however, requires a more detailed understanding of the benefits that these agents may offer above and beyond existing therapies. In this review, we examine the burden of influenza infection, diagnostic challenges and the clinical and economic impact of available interventions. Clinical controversies and potential areas for further investigation are also explored.",,P Cram;S G Blitz;A Monto;A M Fendrick
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32259469/,Predicting the short-term success of human influenza virus variants with machine learning,"Seasonal influenza viruses are constantly changing and produce a different set of circulating strains each season. Small genetic changes can accumulate over time and result in antigenically different viruses; this may prevent the body's immune system from recognizing those viruses. Due to rapid mutations, in particular, in the haemagglutinin (HA) gene, seasonal influenza vaccines must be updated frequently. This requires choosing strains to include in the updates to maximize the vaccines' benefits, according to estimates of which strains will be circulating in upcoming seasons. This is a challenging prediction task. In this paper, we use longitudinally sampled phylogenetic trees based on HA sequences from human influenza viruses, together with counts of epitope site polymorphisms in HA, to predict which influenza virus strains are likely to be successful. We extract small groups of taxa (subtrees) and use a suite of features of these subtrees as key inputs to the machine learning tools. Using a range of training and testing strategies, including training on H3N2 and testing on H1N1, we find that successful prediction of future expansion of small subtrees is possible from these data, with accuracies of 0.71-0.85 and a classifier 'area under the curve' 0.75-0.9.",influenza; machine learning; phylogenetics; prediction; tree shape statistics.,Maryam Hayati;Priscila Biller;Caroline Colijn

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28767274/,Pricing Externalities to Balance Public Risks and Benefits of Research,"How should scientific funders evaluate research with public health risks? Some risky work is valuable, but accepting too much risk may be ethically neglectful. Recent controversy over H5N1 influenza experiments has highlighted the difficulty of this problem. Advocates of the research claim the work is needed to understand pandemics, while opponents claim that accidents or misuse could release the very pandemic the work is meant to prevent. In an attempt to resolve the debate, the US government sponsored an independent evaluation that successfully produced a quantitative estimate of the risks involved, but only a qualitative estimate of the benefits. Given the difficulties of this ""apples-to-oranges"" risk-benefit analysis, what is the best way forward? Here we outline a general approach for balancing risks and benefits of research with public risks. Instead of directly comparing risks and benefits, our approach requires only an estimate of risk, which is then translated into a financial price. This estimate can be obtained either through a centrally commissioned risk assessment or by mandating liability insurance, which allows private markets to estimate the financial burden of risky research. The resulting price can then be included in the cost of the research, enabling funders to evaluate grants as usual-comparing the scientific merits of a project against its full cost to society. This approach has the advantage of aligning incentives by assigning costs to those responsible for risks. It also keeps scientific funding decisions in the hands of scientists, while involving the public on questions of values and risk experts on risk evaluation.",,Sebastian Farquhar;Owen Cotton-Barratt;Andrew Snyder-Beattie

Neuraminidase inhibitors are specific antiviral drugs with activity on both typesA and B Influenzavirus. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated on duration of disease, intensity of symptoms, reduction of complications including those increasing antibiotic use. Moreover, limited studies have demonstrated a positive effect on hospitalizations and mortality risk in some populations. Neuraminidase inhibitors exhibit also a protective effect when administered as prophylaxis (post-exposure prophylaxis, seasonal prophylaxis, or prophylaxis during institution epidemic). For these reasons, neuraminidase inhibitors should not be considered as symptomatic treatment of influenza, but as specific antiviral drugs and play an important role (especially oseltamivir) in the French pandemic plan.

This study investigated the modeling of influenza's pathological effects on the speech signals of the Arabic vowels ""A"" and ""O."" For feature extraction, linear prediction coding (LPC) of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) subsignals denoted by LPCW was used. k-Nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were used for classification. To study the pathological effects of influenza on the vowel ""A"" and vowel ""O,"" power spectral density (PSD) and spectrogram were illustrated, where the PSD of ""A"" and ""O"" was repressed as a result of the pathological effects. The obtained results showed that the verification parameters achieved for the vowel ""A"" were better than those for vowel ""O"" for both KNN and SVM for an average. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used for interpretation. The modeling by the speech utterances as words was also investigated.

Data collected included information on baseline demographic and health characteristics, vaccination status and outcomes (hospitalizations and death). Multivariate regression techniques were used to compare the risks of outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons while controlling for covariates and confounders. Results for data pooled over the 6 seasons demonstrated that influenza vaccination was associated with significant reductions in hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and death among the elderly. Similar findings were observed for low, intermediate, and high risk subgroups. Vaccination was also associated with cost savings.

However, the strategy for use of these drugs is still under debate. We evaluated the impact of prophylaxis of healthcare workers (HCWs) through a mathematical model that considers attack rates in a range of 25-35% in the general population and 25-50% among HCWs. Simulations and uncertainty analysis using the demographics of the province of Ontario, Canada show that increasing prophylaxis coverage of HCWs has little impact on reducing the reproduction number of disease transmission and may not prevent the occurrence of an outbreak if expected. However, it does enable a high level of treatment, which substantially reduces morbidity and mortality in the population as a whole. Therefore, prophylaxis of HCWs should be considered an important part of public health efforts for minimizing influenza pandemic burden and its socio-economic disruption.",,Michael Gardam;Dong Liang;Seyed M Moghadas;Jianhong Wu;Qingling Zeng;Huaiping Zhu

During the first quarter of 1969 the epidemic involved almost all cities of the Soviet Union. The intensities of the rise and of the fall of the 1969 epidemic wave were less pronounced than those of the 1965 influenza A2 epidemic, but were more extended. In most towns the epidemic lasted 50-80 days whereas in 1965 the epidemic in towns lasted 25-30 days.The influenza caused by A2/Hong Kong/68 was characterized by an unusual age-group distribution. Children under 7 years of age made up only one-quarter of the total influenza cases during the peak of the epidemic wave in most communities.

Questionnaires were used to collect prospective data on 1,122 cases with influenza-like illness at our medical institutions. The independent predictors of influenza A virus were identified on the basis of demographic features and the clinical symptoms of the patients who tested positive for influenza A virus in the RIDT test. Of the 1,122 cases tested, 389 (34.7%) were positive for the influenza A virus. The median age of the influenza-positive patients was 14, and 58.9% of the patients were male. The symptoms fever, cough, rhinorrhea, and headache were statistically dominant. A history of recent contact with persons suffering from influenza or influenza-like illness at home, school, or in the workplace was significantly more common in the positive group than in the negative group. Pneumonia was observed in 2 (0.5%) of the positive patients, but the symptoms were only severe enough to require hospitalization in 1 of the 2. No deaths were observed among the 389 RIDT-positive patients. Although the spread of influenza A virus was both rapid and extensive, mainly among children under the age of 18, it seemed to be mild.

Modern populations are more mobile than ever before, and with this mobility comes active global mixing of infectious disease. To understand the spread of diseases such as influenza, we use a multi-city epidemic model. We extend the SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model to incorporate population migration between cities, and use this model to analyze the geographic spread of influenza. We investigate the effectiveness of travel restrictions as a control against the spread of influenza. First we obtain the basic reproduction number for the single city case, and observe two other control strategies suggested by this case: increasing the number of clinically ill individuals that are treated, and reducing the interval between infection and treatment of such individuals. We evaluate the effectiveness of the three control strategies with numerical simulations. It is shown that travel restrictions are less effective than the other two strategies. In general, travel restriction tends to delay the spread of the disease into new cities. However, it can increase the peak height of infected populations in all cities. An understanding of the epidemiological structures of related cities is strongly recommended in order to effectively apply the travel restriction strategy.",,Jung Min Lee;Donghoon Choi;Giphil Cho;Yongkuk Kim

Their offspring had virtually identical mean birth weights, skull circumferences, lengths, and incidences of neonatal jaundice. Although all the infections occurred in either the second or the third trimesters of pregnancy, the cases delivered more babies with congenital abnormalities than did the controls. The possibility was considered that the presence of an abnormal fetus made these women more susceptible to influenza infection. Unexpectedly, the women experiencing influenza infection during pregnancy delivered an excess of male babies, and an excess of females was born to the controls.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19931952/,Incompletely matched influenza vaccine still provides protection in frail elderly,"A cluster-randomised controlled trial of antiviral treatment to control influenza outbreaks in aged-care facilities (ACFs) provided an opportunity to assess VE in the frail, institutionalised elderly. Data were pooled from five influenza outbreaks in 2007. Rapid testing methods for influenza were used to confirm outbreaks and/or identify further cases. Vaccination coverage among ACF residents ranged from 59% to 100%, whereas it was consistently low in staff (11-33%). The attack rates for laboratory-confirmed influenza in residents ranged from 9% to 24%, with the predominate strain determined to be influenza A. Sequencing of the hemagglutinin gene from a sub-sample demonstrated an incomplete match with the 2007 southern hemisphere influenza vaccine.

Although understanding of influenza viruses has greatly increased in recent years, shortcomings remain. Additionally, the continuous mutation of influenza viruses through genetic reassortment and selection of variants that escape host immune responses can render current influenza vaccines ineffective at controlling seasonal epidemics and potential pandemics. Thus, there is a knowledge gap in the understanding of influenza viruses and a corresponding need to develop novel universal vaccines and therapeutic treatments. Investigation of viral pathogenesis, transmission mechanisms, and efficacy of influenza vaccine candidates requires animal models that can recapitulate the disease. Furthermore, the choice of animal model for each research question is crucial in order for researchers to acquire a better knowledge of influenza viruses.

The most effective public health intervention strategy is to combine preventive vaccination with nonpharmaceutical intervention strategies and enhanced surveillance activities. H5N1 vaccines are poorly immunogenic even at high doses; an adjuvant is needed for enhancement of immunogenicity and for dose-sparing. Lack of effective, yet safe, adjuvants is the limiting factor for candidate vaccines that utilize egg-dependent or egg-independent manufacturing technologies. Hence, developing novel adjuvants is crucial for pandemic influenza vaccine development. Although the use of antiviral drugs is also an important public health countermeasure for preventing and treating influenza, the emergence of drug-resistant strains of avian H5N1 viruses underscores the need to develop not only new drugs but other novel preventive and therapeutic strategies such as vaccines.",,Suryaprakash Sambhara;Gregory A Poland

The outbreak of the next influenza pandemic is very probable. The disturbing events that occurred in Hong Kong in 1997 and in the beginning of 2003 confirmed such a possibility. Every year in Poland influenza causes from several hundred thousands to several millions of cases of infections. All over the world the annual number of influenza cases amounts to approximately 100 millions and from 0.5 million to 1 million patients die due to influenza. The most severe threat is connected with post-influenza complications that are the cause of death after influenza infection. The only one effective method of prophylaxis against influenza and its complications is vaccination. Moreover, since 1999 new anti-influenza drugs are available: oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). They are effective for treatment or for treatment and prophylaxis of infections caused by influenza virus type A and also type B. The efficacy of these drugs depends on appropriate diagnosis.

Previous models have identified treatment regimes to minimize total infections and keep resistance low. However, the bulk of these studies have ignored stochasticity and heterogeneous contact structures. Here we develop a network model of influenza transmission with treatment and resistance, and present both standard mean-field approximations as well as simulated dynamics. We find differences in the final epidemic sizes for identical transmission parameters (bistability) leading to different optimal treatment timing depending on the number initially infected. We also find, contrary to previous results, that treatment targeted by number of contacts per individual (node degree) gives rise to more resistance at lower levels of treatment than non-targeted treatment. Finally we highlight important differences between the two methods of analysis (mean-field versus stochastic simulations), and show where traditional mean-field approximations fail. Our results have important implications not only for the timing and distribution of influenza chemotherapy, but also for mathematical epidemiological modeling in general. Antiviral resistance in influenza may carry large consequences for pandemic mitigation efforts, and models ignoring contact heterogeneity and stochasticity may provide misleading policy recommendations.",,Benjamin M Althouse;Oscar Patterson-Lomba;Georg M Goerg;Laurent Hébert-Dufresne

Strategies designed to limit community transmission, such as antiviral deployment, were largely ineffective due to both feasibility constraints and the generally mild nature of disease, resulting in incomplete case ascertainment. Reviews of national pandemic plans have identified pandemic impact, primarily linked to measures of transmissibility and severity, as a key concept to incorporate into the next generation of plans. While an assessment of impact provides the rationale under which interventions may be warranted, it does not directly provide an assessment on whether particular interventions may be effective. Such considerations motivate our introduction of the concept of pandemic controllability. For case-targeted interventions, such as antiviral treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis, we identify the visibility and transmissibility of a pandemic as the key drivers of controllability. Taking a case-study approach, we suggest that high-impact pandemics, for which control is most desirable, are likely uncontrollable with case-targeted interventions. Strategies that do not rely on the identification of cases may prove relatively more effective. By introducing a pragmatic framework for relating the assessment of impact to the ability to mitigate an epidemic (controllability), we hope to address a present omission identified in pandemic response plans.",communicable diseases; management and policy; pandemic influenza; research.,J M McCaw;K Glass;G N Mercer;J McVernon

Without a strain-specific vaccine, pandemics can only be mitigated by employing combinations of low-efficacy pre-pandemic vaccines and reactive response measures that are carried out as the pandemic unfolds. Unfortunately, the application of reactive interventions can lead to unintended consequences that may exacerbate unpredictable spreading dynamics and cause more drawn-out epidemics. Here, we employ a detailed model of pandemic influenza in Australia to simulate the combination of pre-pandemic vaccination and reactive antiviral prophylaxis. This study focuses on population-level coupling effects between the respective methods, and the associated spatio-temporal fluctuations in pandemic dynamics produced by reactive strategies. Our results show that combining strategies can produce either mutual improvement of performance or interference that reduces the effectiveness of each strategy when they are used together.

Recent cases of NI resistance are a cause for concern. To assess the danger of NI resistance, a number of studies have reported the fraction of treated patients from which resistant strains could be isolated. Unfortunately, those results strongly depend on the details of the experimental protocol. Additionally, knowing the fraction of patients harboring resistance is not too useful by itself. Instead, we want to know how likely it is that an infected patient can generate a resistant infection in a secondary host, and how likely it is that the resistant strain subsequently spreads. While estimates for these parameters can often be obtained from epidemiological data, such data is lacking for NI resistance in influenza. Here, we use an approach that does not rely on epidemiological data. Instead, we combine data from influenza infections of human volunteers with a mathematical framework that allows estimation of the parameters that govern the initial generation and subsequent spread of resistance. We show how these parameters are influenced by changes in drug efficacy, timing of treatment, fitness of the resistant strain, and details of virus and immune system dynamics. Our study provides estimates for parameters that can be directly used in mathematical and computational models to study how NI usage might lead to the emergence and spread of resistance in the population. We find that the initial generation of resistant cases is most likely lower than the fraction of resistant cases reported. However, we also show that the results depend strongly on the details of the within-host dynamics of influenza infections, and most importantly, the role the immune system plays.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17262054/,The evolution of epidemic influenza,"Recent developments in complete-genome sequencing, antigenic mapping and epidemiological modelling are greatly improving our knowledge of the evolution of human influenza virus at the epidemiological scale. In particular, recent studies have revealed a more complex relationship between antigenic evolution, natural selection and reassortment than previously realized. Despite these advances, there is much that remains to be understood about the epidemiology of influenza virus, particularly the processes that determine the virus's strong seasonality. We argue that a complete understanding of the evolutionary biology of this important human pathogen will require a genomic view of genetic diversity, including the acquisition of polymorphism data from within individual hosts and from geographical regions, particularly the tropics, which have been poorly surveyed to date.",,Martha I Nelson;Edward C Holmes

Of the 3 epidemic outbreaks in the USSR, 2 were associated with influenza B virus (in the 1980/81 and 1983/84 seasons) and 1 with influenza A virus of the H3N2 subtype. In the USSR, influenza A (H1N1) virus never predominated as a cause of epidemic during the 5 years period. In Czechoslovakia, 2 epidemics (in the 1980/81 and 1983/84 seasons) were due to influenza A (H1N1) virus. The epidemic in the 1981/82 season had two waves of unequal heights and a mixed type B and subtype A (H3N2) etiology; a two-wave epidemic associated with isolates of influenza A (H1N1) and influenza B viruses was also recorded in the 1983/84 season. The influenza A (H3N2) epidemic in 1983 was of explosive character. All influenza viruses circulating in the two countries between 1980 and 1985 were of the same antigenic profile, but were isolated from the epidemics that occurred in different influenza seasons. The virological surveillance revealed strains of virus closely related to drift variants detected from outbreaks in 1977-1979 and the new variants A/Chile 1/83, A/Philippines 2/82, A/Caen 1/84 and B/USSR 100/83.",,B Tůmová;M A Yakhno;I V Antonova;F Heinz;L Syrůcek;V A Isachenko;A Stumpa;Zakatelskaya LYa

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21304943/,"Human mobility networks, travel restrictions, and the global spread of 2009 H1N1 pandemic","After the emergence of the H1N1 influenza in 2009, some countries responded with travel-related controls during the early stage of the outbreak in an attempt to contain or slow down its international spread. These controls along with self-imposed travel limitations contributed to a decline of about 40% in international air traffic to/from Mexico following the international alert. However, no containment was achieved by such restrictions and the virus was able to reach pandemic proportions in a short time. When gauging the value and efficacy of mobility and travel restrictions it is crucial to rely on epidemic models that integrate the wide range of features characterizing human mobility and the many options available to public health organizations for responding to a pandemic. Here we present a comprehensive computational and theoretical study of the role of travel restrictions in halting and delaying pandemics by using a model that explicitly integrates air travel and short-range mobility data with high-resolution demographic data across the world and that is validated by the accumulation of data from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. We explore alternative scenarios for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic by assessing the potential impact of mobility restrictions that vary with respect to their magnitude and their position in the pandemic timeline. We provide a quantitative discussion of the delay obtained by different mobility restrictions and the likelihood of containing outbreaks of infectious diseases at their source, confirming the limited value and feasibility of international travel restrictions. These results are rationalized in the theoretical framework characterizing the invasion dynamics of the epidemics at the metapopulation level.",,Paolo Bajardi;Chiara Poletto;Jose J Ramasco;Michele Tizzoni;Vittoria Colizza;Alessandro Vespignani

For influenza A viruses there was evidence of the continued circulation of classical swine H1N1 virus (26%) seroprevalence), and human H3N2 viruses (39%) which are antigenically most closely-related to A/Port Chalmers/1/73 virus. In addition antibodies were detected to A/swine/England/201635/92 (8%), a strain of H3N2 virus which appears to have arisen by antigenic drift from conventional H3N2 swine strains. Specific antibodies (2%) were detected to an H1N1 virus (A/swine/England/195852/92) related most closely to avian H1N1 strains. In tests with human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, excluding isolates from pigs, the highest seroprevalence was detected to the prevailing strains from the human population. Serological tests with avian H4 and H10, human H2, equine 1 and 2 influenza A viruses were all negative. Seven pigs seropositive by haemagglutination-inhibition, virus neutralization and immunoblotting assays for antibody to influenza B virus, were randomly distributed geographically suggesting that influenza B viruses may be transmitted to pigs but fail to spread. The seroprevalence to influenza C viruses was 9.9% indicating that these viruses are widespread in pigs. These results provide further evidence that the pig can be infected by a number of influenza viruses, some of which may have significance in the epidemiology of human influenza.",,I H Brown;P A Harris;D J Alexander

The influenza viruses are capable of causing annual epidemics because of the constant changes that occur at the antigenic sites of the surface proteins. These antigenic changes, also known as antigenic drift (minor change) and antigenic shift (major change), allow the influenza virus to infect a substantial segment of the population with incomplete or no immunity. Composition of the influenza virus vaccine is changed on a yearly basis to provide the best match to new influenza virus strain(s) predicted to cause the next epidemic. Only by annual administration of influenza virus vaccine prior to the epidemic can health care providers expect to prevent influenza virus pneumonia and its associated complications in high-risk groups.

This focus has, in turn, shaped the global governance structures around pandemic influenza, with collective efforts centred on facilitating virus sharing, maintaining and increasing vaccine production, and ensuring access to pharmaceuticals - responses that remain unattainable for many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the short to medium term. This paper argues that this emphasis on pharmacological responses reflects a particular view of biomedicine that pays inadequate attention to the weak capacity of many health systems. In more recent years, this dynamic has been further exacerbated by the influence of evidence-based medicine (EBM) that preferences certain types of biomedical knowledge and practice. This paper explores the role that EBM has played in shaping the global governance of pandemic influenza, and how it has served to reinforce and reify the authority of particular groups of actors, including policy-makers, elected officials and the medical community. The paper concludes that only by unpacking these structures and revealing the political authority in play can alternative policy responses more appropriate to LMICs be considered.",,Adam Kamradt-Scott

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25446940/,"Avian influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in humans: epidemiology, evolution, and pathogenesis","New human influenza A virus strains regularly emerge causing seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. Lately, several zoonotic avian influenza A strains have been reported to directly infect humans. In early 2013, a novel avian influenza A virus (H7N9) strain was discovered in China to cause severe respiratory disease in humans. Since then, over 450 human cases of H7N9 infection have been discovered and 165 of them have died. Multiple epidemiological, phylogenetic, in vivo, and in vitro studies have been done to determine the origin and pathogenesis of novel H7N9 strain. This article reviews the literature related to the epidemiology, evolution, and pathogenesis of the H7N9 strain since its discovery in February 2013 till August 2014. The data available so far indicate that H7N9 was originated by a two-step reassortment process in birds and transmitted to humans through direct contact with live-bird markets. H7N9 is a low-pathogenic avian virus and contains several molecular signatures for adaptation in mammals. The severity of the respiratory disease caused by novel H7N9 virus in humans can be partly attributed to the age, sex, and underlying medical conditions of the patients. A universal influenza vaccine is not available, though several strain-specific H7N9 candidate vaccine viruses have been developed. Further, novel H7N9 virus is resistant to antiviral drug amantadine and some H7N9 isolates have acquired the resistance to neuraminidase-inhibitors. Therefore, constant surveillance and prompt control measures combined with novel research approaches to develop alternative and effective anti-influenza strategies are needed to overcome influenza A virus.",ARDS; Epidemic; H7N9; Novel avian influenza A virus; Pneumonia; Reassortment.,Matloob Husain

In this study, we provided more bioinformatics and statistic evidences for further predicting the significant biological functions of glycosite migration in the host adaptation of human influenza H1N1 viruses, by employing homology modeling and in silico protein glycosylation of representative HA and NA proteins as well as amino acid variability analysis at antigenic sites of HA and NA. The results showed that glycosite migrations in human influenza viruses have at least five possible functions: to more effectively mask the antigenic sites, to more effectively protect the enzymatic cleavage sites of neuraminidase (NA), to stabilize the polymeric structures, to regulate the receptor binding and catalytic activities and to balance the binding activity of hemagglutinin (HA) with the release activity of NA. The information here can provide some constructive suggestions for the function research related to protein glycosylation of influenza viruses, although these predictions still need to be supported by experimental data.",,Shisheng Sun;Qinzhe Wang;Fei Zhao;Wentian Chen;Zheng Li

Using newspapers and official death records to reconstruct mortality peaks from influenza and excess pneumonia deaths in New Zealand before 1918 enabled comparisons with peaks of influenza mortality by age in 1918 from individual death records. For males, mortality peaks in the 1885, 1890-1892, 1894, and 1898 influenza outbreaks appeared to match those from the 1918 pandemic. For females, peaks of deaths in 1918 corresponded to those from the influenza outbreaks of 1887 and 1890-1892. The highest mortality rates for both sexes were among those 28-32 years of age. Although they lend strong support to the hypothesis of fatal immunological reactions derived from early exposure to a different influenza virus, the results from this study also raise more questions: Given that the A/H1N1 virus of 1918 was exceptionally virulent, why did so few children 5-15 years of age die from it? Influenza normally kills only the very young and the very old. In addition, why did twice as many European males as females die in the young-adult age groups, whereas Māori males and females died at almost identical rates?",,Geoffrey W Rice

Determinative beliefs regarding the 1918 pandemic include that infections were expressed as primary viral pneumonias and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome, that pandemic-related deaths were the end states of the natural progression of disease caused by the pandemic strain, and that bacterial superinfections caused relatively fewer deaths in 1918 than in subsequent pandemics. In turn, response plans are focused on developing and/or increasing inventories of a strain-specific vaccine, antivirals, intensive care beds, mechanical ventilators, and so on. Yet, there is strong and consistent evidence of epidemiologically and clinically important interactions between influenza and secondary bacterial respiratory pathogens, including during the 1918 pandemic. Countermeasures (eg, vaccination against pneumococcal and meningococcal disease before a pandemic; mass uses of antibiotic(s) with broad spectrums of activity against common bacterial respiratory pathogens during local epidemics) designed to prevent or mitigate the effects of influenza-bacterial interactions should be major focuses of pandemic-related research, prevention, and response planning.",,John F Brundage

However, neither of these hypotheses accounts for the age-distribution of severe cases and deaths, or for the geographic and other variations in rates and explosiveness of mortality during the Pandemic. It will be shown here that, alternatively, the epidemiology of the influenza lethality could be completely explained by a combination of two determinants: (1) acquired immune-differentiation of birth-cohorts, within populations, through developmental epigenetic adaptation (and selection) secondary to maternal or early-life episodes of influenza infection and (2) a triggering context - emergence of a new sub-type/strain, and its co-circulation (competition?) with seasonal viruses immunologically related to ones that had circulated in the past and primed particular population birth-cohorts.

Animal models and kinetic models have improved our understanding of how influenza viruses interact with their bacterial co-pathogens and the accompanying immune responses. Data from these models indicate that considerable alterations in epithelial surfaces and aberrant immune responses lead to severe inflammation, a key driver of bacterial acquisition and infection severity following influenza.

Death was not a direct outcome of flu itself but rather a consequence of secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia, for which antibiotics had not yet been discovered. Pre-existing pulmonary tuberculosis was also accountable for increased flu death rates during the pandemic. As it happened in Europe, in Argentina the epidemic had two main waves, with ample variation in mortality by region. Available treatment at the time included diet, throat antiseptic rinses, low doses of quinine valerianate, salicylates, codeine as a cough suppressant, and camphor oil. Primitive anti-pneumococcal vaccines and immune sera were also applied. Upon the disclosure of the whole RNA sequence of the 1918 influenza virus genome, by means of reverse genetics it was possible to assemble viral particles resembling those of the deadly pandemic.

The zoonotic and spatial origins of the influenza virus associated with the ""Spanish flu"" pandemic of 1918 have been debated for decades. Outbreaks of respiratory disease in US swine occurred concurrently with disease in humans, raising the possibility that the 1918 virus originated in pigs. Swine also were proposed as ""mixing vessel"" intermediary hosts between birds and humans during the 1957 Asian and 1968 Hong Kong pandemics. Swine have presented an attractive explanation for how avian viruses overcome the substantial evolutionary barriers presented by different cellular environments in humans and birds. However, key assumptions underpinning the swine mixing-vessel model of pandemic emergence have been challenged in light of new evidence. Increased surveillance in swine has revealed that human-to-swine transmission actually occurs far more frequently than the reverse, and there is no empirical evidence that swine played a role in the emergence of human influenza in 1918, 1957, or 1968. Swine-to-human transmission occurs periodically and can trigger pandemics, as in 2009.

To address these problems, African Americans mounted efforts such as establishing separate hospitals and professional organizations and repudiating racist scientific theories. Contradicting prevailing theories about African Americans' increased susceptibility to disease, it appears that during the 1918 epidemic the incidence of influenza was lower in African Americans. Although the epidemic had a less devastating impact on African American communities, it still overwhelmed their medical and public health resources. Observations about the lower rates of influenza in African Americans did not derail racist theories about the biological inferiority of black people or overturn conceptualizations of black people as disease threats to white people. When the epidemic ended, the major problems that African Americans faced still remained.",,Vanessa Northington Gamble

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22106709/,Breastfeeding--anti-viral potential and relevance to the influenza virus pandemic,"Essential nutritive and immunological ingredients abundantly present in breastmilk make it the choice infant nutrition. The uniqueness of mother's milk, in contrast to most therapeutics and immunizations, lies in its potential to adapt itself to the requirements of the infant so that timely immune defenses are tapped from its constituents by immune regulation, modulation and immune acceleration to stimulate novel substances; these render it pertinent as defense when faced with challenging organisms. While it is appreciated that immunity can be transferred from mother to infant through breastmilk following maternal influenza vaccination, the immense benefits conferred by breastfeeding per se during influenza pandemics may not be fully valued. This is substantiated by debates and ambiguities for continued breastfeeding in the face of maternal influenza infections. This article emphasises the utmost importance of breastfeeding in viral pandemics in the light of the changing immunological strategies used by viruses at different times and the urgent need for such opportune defenses. The prolific interaction of its constituents is frequently understated as enormous advantages to the suckling infant.",,K K Prameela

To date, only influenza A viruses within the H1-H3 subtypes have achieved this capacity. However, sporadic cases of severe disease in individuals following infection with avian influenza A viruses over the past decade, and the emergence of a pandemic H1N1 swine-origin virus in 2009, underscore the need to better understand how influenza viruses acquire the ability to transmit efficiently. In this review, we discuss the biological constraints and molecular features known to affect virus transmissibility to and among humans. Factors influencing the behaviour of aerosols in the environment are described, and the mammalian models used to study virus transmission are presented. Recent progress in understanding the molecular determinants that confer efficient transmission has identified crucial roles for the haemagglutinin and polymerase proteins; nevertheless, influenza virus transmission remains a polygenic trait that is not completely understood. The clinical implications of this research, including methods currently under investigation to mitigate influenza virus human-to-human transmission, are discussed. A better understanding of the viral determinants necessary for efficient transmission will allow us to identify avian influenza viruses with pandemic potential.",,Jessica A Belser;Taronna R Maines;Terrence M Tumpey;Jacqueline M Katz

The illness is characterized by seasonality and nonspecific clinical manifestations of upper respiratory infection at a time when other respiratory illnesses are common in the community, making the diagnosis challenging. However, accurate and timely diagnosis by new molecular techniques is crucial in the management of immunocompromised patients, because delays in initiating appropriate therapy can have devastating consequences. Emergence of viral resistance to currently used antiviral agents is of concern, particularly in immunocompromised hosts, and warrants continued monitoring and surveillance.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21573121/,The global transmission and control of influenza,"New strains of influenza spread around the globe via the movement of infected individuals. The global dynamics of influenza are complicated by different patterns of influenza seasonality in different regions of the world. We have released an open-source stochastic mathematical model of the spread of influenza across 321 major, strategically located cities of the world. Influenza is transmitted between cities via infected airline passengers. Seasonality is simulated by increasing the transmissibility in each city at the times of the year when influenza has been observed to be most prevalent. The spatiotemporal spread of pandemic influenza can be understood through clusters of global transmission and links between them, which we identify using the epidemic percolation network (EPN) of the model. We use the model to explain the observed global pattern of spread for pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009-2010 (pandemic H1N1 2009) and to examine possible global patterns of spread for future pandemics depending on the origin of pandemic spread, time of year of emergence, and basic reproductive number (). We also use the model to investigate the effectiveness of a plausible global distribution of vaccine for various pandemic scenarios. For pandemic H1N1 2009, we show that the biggest impact of vaccination was in the temperate northern hemisphere. For pandemics starting in the temperate northern hemisphere in May or April, vaccination would have little effect in the temperate southern hemisphere and a small effect in the tropics. With the increasing interconnectedness of the world's population, we must take a global view of infectious disease transmission. Our open-source, computationally simple model can help public health officials plan for the next pandemic as well as deal with interpandemic influenza.",,Eben Kenah;Dennis L Chao;Laura Matrajt;M Elizabeth Halloran;Ira M Longini Jr

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17037354/,[Expression of host genes in influenza virus infected cells],"When NCI-H292 human bronchial epithelial cells were infected with influenza A/Udorn/72(H3N2) virus, 152 host genes were identified as virus-stimulated genes (VSGs). The expression of these genes was increased more than 4-fold by the virus infection and reached to the level of more than one copy per cell. Seventy-three VSGs were also stimulated by interferon-beta (IFN-beta) treatment and they contained the genes known to possess antiviral activity. As a likely consequence, the production of progeny viruses was transient in H292 cells and the cells survived through infection. The stimulation of the VSGs is not mediated by IFNs but triggered by the infection itself at least at the early phase of infection. In A549 human lung epithelial cells, the increase of the VSG expression was less than 1/6 on the average of that in H292 and virus production continued until cell death. These indicate that some VSGs might constitute intracellular antiviral mechanisms. On the other hand, the NS1 protein of influenza virus shuts off host gene expression by inhibiting the polyadenylation-site cleavage of host pre-mRNAs. Therefore, balance of the shut-off and the activation of cellular genes during virus infection may be crucial in determining the outcome of infection.",,Kazufumi Shimizu;Kazumichi Kuroda

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14761242/,The threat and prospects for control of an influenza pandemic,"Influenza constitutes the most widespread and significant respiratory infectious disease in the world, resulting in increased morbidity, mortality and economic loss each epidemic year. Pandemic influenza is a worldwide epidemic usually caused by a new virus variant to which the majority of the population has no immunity. As demonstrated in the devastating pandemic of 1918 to 1919, a pandemic virus may infect 30 to 50% of the worlds population and kill 1 to 2% of those infected. Pandemic control must be a concerted and co-ordinated world strategy and under the auspices of the World Health Organization, pandemic preparedness plans have been formulated, including: intensified surveillance for more rapid identification of new reassortant viruses with potential human virulence and infectivity, laboratory characterization of the new viruses so that vaccine may be prepared, development of techniques for more rapid vaccine production and the manufacture and stock piling of antiviral drugs. The H5N1 outbreak of virulent chicken influenza in 1997 in Hong Kong which resulted in the deaths of six of 18 infected persons serves as a wake-up call.

Lung protective ventilation strategy with a low tidal volume and low pressure, in addition to a conservative fluid management approach, is recommended when treating patients with ARDS. Low-dose steroids may be considered in the treatment of refractory septic shock. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) may play a limited supportive role for early ARDS/acute lung injury, but it is contra-indicated in critically ill patients with multi-organ failure and haemodynamic instability. NPPV and oxygen therapy should be applied in healthcare facilities with good ventilation and respiratory protection as substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs within a 0.5 m and 0.4 m radius of patients receiving NPPV and oxygen via a simple mask, respectively. Intravenous gammaglobulin should be used with caution for treatment of reactive haemo-phagocytosis due to its thrombogenic effects, whereas the role of etoposide needs evaluation with animal models. Passive immunotherapy in the form of convalescent plasma may be useful as rescue therapy. More data are needed to explore the potential role of other drugs with immuno-modulating properties such as statins. Healthcare workers currently must apply strict standards, contact and droplet precautions when dealing with suspected cases, and upgrade to airborne precautions when performing aerosol-generating procedures.

The objective of this study was to determine whether observed 25(OH)D levels could be used to simulate observed influenza infection rates. Data of mean and variance in 25(OH)D serum levels by month were obtained from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and used to parameterize an individual-based model of influenza transmission dynamics in two regions of the United States. Simulations were compared with observed daily influenza excess mortality data. Best-fitting simulations could reproduce the observed seasonal cycle of influenza; however, these best-fit simulations were shown to be highly sensitive to stochastic processes within the model and were unable consistently to reproduce observed seasonal patterns. In this respect the simulations with the vitamin D forced model were inferior to similar modeling efforts using absolute humidity and the school calendar as seasonal forcing variables. These model results indicate it is unlikely that seasonal variations in vitamin D levels principally determine the seasonality of influenza in temperate regions.",,Jeffrey Shaman;Christie Y Jeon;Edward Giovannucci;Marc Lipsitch

Excess mortality has been documented since 1889, and the infamous 1918 outbreak confirmed that influenza was truly one of the last major plagues. Despite the clear recognition of large clusters of influenza activity, it is still difficult to quantify precisely the total impact of influenza morbidity and mortality, since laboratory confirmation is required for exact diagnosis. Many methods have been developed to provide estimates of the mortality associated with influenza. These methods are usually predicated on establishing expected baseline rates of mortality. Deaths in excess of these rates are then calculated--and attributed to the circulating influenza virus. In this way, groups at high risk of mortality have been defined as the elderly and those with chronic conditions. Special-risk groups, such as those in institutions, have also been identified. The quantification of morbidity has required different approaches, and here community and family studies have made major contributions. In contrast to mortality, morbidity is most pronounced in children and young adults, and the diseases, although self-limited, are often quite severe.

One way to improve early detection is to monitor health-seeking behaviour in the form of queries to online search engines, which are submitted by millions of users around the world each day. Here we present a method of analysing large numbers of Google search queries to track influenza-like illness in a population. Because the relative frequency of certain queries is highly correlated with the percentage of physician visits in which a patient presents with influenza-like symptoms, we can accurately estimate the current level of weekly influenza activity in each region of the United States, with a reporting lag of about one day. This approach may make it possible to use search queries to detect influenza epidemics in areas with a large population of web search users.",,Jeremy Ginsberg;Matthew H Mohebbi;Rajan S Patel;Lynnette Brammer;Mark S Smolinski;Larry Brilliant

This information allowed the creation of strategies to protect the world population and mainly the most vulnerable groups such as pregnant women. In this group the lung complications specially the pneumonia cases, leads to the patient hospitalization with a higher perinatal mortality rates. The signs and symptoms of seasonal influenza as well as A H1N1 influenza in pregnant women are always more serious, and this is why they need intensive treatments. However, not all patients need to be hospitalized nor to check with sophisticated exams the presence of the virus. Every unhealthy women need to be classified by their signs and symptoms according Triage scale, and their hospitalization has to be only if the situation gets worse or if a chronic disease complicate it such as diabetes, AIDS, heart condition, asthma, obesity, etc. According to the scale in which the patient has been classified, she needs to be isolated in her home and start a symptomatic treatment and add antiviral medications only in suspicious pandemic influenza cases. However if respiratory pathology gets worse the patient should be hospitalized immediately in a unit with the proper equipment. Every citizen must receive the A H1N1 vaccine, but pregnant women and breastfeeding women particularly. Pregnant women should receive the vaccine in any trimester of pregnancy, but especially in the last to prevent maternal and fetal complications as well as elevation of perinatal mortality.",,Armando Torres-Ramírez

Detailed knowledge of antibody production pre- and post-vaccination is required to understand vaccine-induced immunity. This article describes a reliable point-by-point protocol to determine influenza-specific antibody titers. The first protocol describes a method to specify the antigen amounts required for hemagglutination, which standardizes the concentrations for subsequent usage in the second protocol (hemagglutination assay, HA assay). The second protocol describes the quantification of influenza-specific antibody titers against different viral strains by using a serial dilution of human serum or cell culture supernatants (hemagglutination inhibition assay, HI assay). As an applied example, we show the antibody response of a healthy cohort, which received a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. Additionally, the cross-reactivity between the different influenza viruses is shown and methods to minimize cross-reactivity by using different types of animal red blood cells (RBCs) are explained. The discussion highlights advantages and disadvantages of the presented assays and how the determination of influenza-specific antibody titers can improve the understanding of vaccine-related immunity.",,Lukas Kaufmann;Mohammedyaseen Syedbasha;Dominik Vogt;Yvonne Hollenstein;Julia Hartmann;Janina E Linnik;Adrian Egli

Due to the seasonality of the influenza pandemic, the dynamics is studied in a finite time interval. We focus primarily on controlling the disease with a possible minimal cost and side effects using control theory which is therefore applied via the Pontryagin's maximum principle, and it is observed that full treatment effort should be given while increasing vaccination at the onset of the outbreak. Next, sensitivity analysis and simulations (using the fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme) are carried out in order to determine the relative importance of different factors responsible for disease transmission and prevalence.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28704460/,Effects of reactive social distancing on the 1918 influenza pandemic,"The 1918 influenza pandemic was characterized by multiple epidemic waves. We investigated reactive social distancing, a form of behavioral response where individuals avoid potentially infectious contacts in response to available information on an ongoing epidemic or pandemic. We modelled its effects on the three influenza waves in the United Kingdom. In previous studies, human behavioral response was modelled by a Power function of the proportion of recent influenza mortality in a population, and by a Hill function, which is a function of the number of recent influenza mortality. Using a simple epidemic model with a Power function and one common set of parameters, we provided a good model fit for the observed multiple epidemic waves in London boroughs, Birmingham and Liverpool. We further applied the model parameters from these three cities to all 334 administrative units in England and Wales and including the population sizes of individual administrative units. We computed the Pearson's correlation between the observed and simulated for each administrative unit. We found a median correlation of 0.636, indicating that our model predictions are performing reasonably well. Our modelling approach is an improvement from previous studies where separate models are fitted to each city. With the reduced number of model parameters used, we achieved computational efficiency gain without over-fitting the model. We also showed the importance of reactive behavioral distancing as a potential non-pharmaceutical intervention during an influenza pandemic.

Although impaired immunity, such as that caused by hematologic malignancy, has been identified as a risk factor for severe infection with this virus, the course of this infection has not been adequately characterized in patients with underlying hematologic malignancy in comparison with immune competent controls. We report our experience with severe pH1N1 infection in patients with hematologic cancers and compare this group to non-immunosuppressed patients. Data were retrospectively collected on all patients admitted to our institution with confirmed pH1N1 infection. Clinical characteristics, treatments and outcomes were compared between patients with hematologic malignancies and non-immunocompromised controls. Fifteen patients with hematologic malignancy and 49 controls were identified. The control group had higher baseline rates of asthma (p = 0.01) and smoking (p = 0.05) at baseline. Clinical features of infection in the two groups were similar, except for a higher prevalence of abnormalities on chest imaging in the group with malignancy (p = 0.05).

However, there has been a gradual expansion of the recommended groups for annual influenza immunization in order to reduce the incidence of uncomplicated infection, to alleviate the impact of seasonal influenza on health care, and to simplify the application of recommendations. The threat of an influenza pandemic, heightened by recent cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in humans, requires continued efforts in preparedness. Strategies for the control of pandemic influenza must include vaccines, antiviral drugs, and nonpharmaceutical interventions like school closure and voluntary quarantine around cases. The prophylactic efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors, previously observed in household studies, suggests that they will be a useful adjunct to voluntary quarantine.

Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) has been shown to be effective in the treatment and prevention of epidemic influenza infection in adults, adolescents and children (> or = 1 year). Although oseltamivir has not been approved for prophylactic use in children, it has been shown to be effective. Oseltamivir is also active against avian influenza virus strains. Evidence suggests that lower doses or shorter durations of treatment/chemoprophylaxis other than those approved may not be effective and may contribute to emergence of viral resistance. Safety data from dose ranging studies show that 5 day courses of 150 mg twice daily for treatment and 6 week courses of 75 mg twice daily for prophylaxis were as well tolerated as the approved dose regimens. The use of oseltamivir in a pandemic is influenced by the goals of the pandemic plan developed by the responsible Government and Health Authority. To optimize use of antiviral medications, processes will be needed to collect, collate and report outcome data from treated patients and/or from use for chemoprophylaxis of pandemic influenza during the first-wave outbreaks. If oseltamivir is included in a national or regional pandemic plan, stockpiling of the material, either in the form of capsules or the bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient will be necessary.

Farmers could be among the first people to be infected with a novel reassortant virus in a pig herd and may serve as a source of the virus for their communities. In this study, the pig production systems of smallholders in rural Thailand were examined to qualitatively evaluate the potential risks that may contribute to the spread of influenza A viruses. The investigation was based on questionnaire interviews regarding pig farmers' practices and trading activities. We found that extensive pig-human contacts, commingling of pigs and chickens and suboptimal biosecurity practices adopted by farmers and traders may constitute substantial risks for inter-species influenza virus transmission, thereby posing a threat to pig populations and human public health. The regular practices of using manure as field fertilizer, hiring boars from outside and trading activities could contribute to the potential spread of influenza viruses in the local community. To mitigate the potential risks of influenza A virus transmission and spread in the local community, it is recommended that appropriate public health strategies and disease prevention policies for farmers and traders should be developed including improving biosecurity, encouraging separation of animals raised on farms and minimizing the exposure between pigs and humans. Furthermore, surveillance systems for pig diseases should be targeted around the festival months, and on-farm identification of pigs should be promoted.",Thailand; influenza A viruses; pig; public health; risk; smallholder.,P Netrabukkana;I D Robertson;S Kasemsuwan;K Wongsathapornchai;S Fenwick

Data from published clinical studies indicate that the infectivity of influenza A virus is probably very high, so that transmission of infection may involve low doses of virus. At low doses, the relation between dose and the probability of infection is approximately linear, so that the reduction in infection risk is proportional to the reduction in exposure due to particle retention of the mask. A population transmission model was set up to explore the impact of population-wide mask use, allowing estimation of the effects of mask efficacy and coverage (fraction of the population wearing masks) on the basic reproduction number and the infection attack rate. We conclude that population-wide use of face masks could make an important contribution in delaying an influenza pandemic.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21464934/,Can antiviral drugs contain pandemic influenza transmission?,"Antiviral drugs dispensed during the 2009 influenza pandemic generally failed to contain transmission. This poses the question of whether preparedness for a future pandemic should include plans to use antiviral drugs to mitigate transmission.Simulations using a standard transmission model that allows for infected arrivals and delayed vaccination show that attempts to contain transmission require relatively few antiviral doses. In contrast, persistent use of antiviral drugs when the reproduction number remains above 1 use very many doses and are unlikely to reduce the eventual attack rate appreciably unless the stockpile is very large. A second model, in which the community has a household structure, shows that the effectiveness of a strategy of dispensing antiviral drugs to infected households decreases rapidly with time delays in dispensing the antivirals. Using characteristics of past pandemics it is estimated that at least 80% of primary household cases must present upon show of symptoms to have a chance of containing transmission by dispensing antiviral drugs to households. To determine data needs, household outbreaks were simulated with 50% receiving antiviral drugs early and 50% receiving antiviral drugs late. A test to compare the size of household outbreaks indicates that at least 100-200 household outbreaks need to be monitored to find evidence that antiviral drugs can mitigate transmission of the newly emerged virus.Use of antiviral drugs in an early attempt to contain transmission should be part of preparedness plans for a future influenza pandemic. Data on the incidence of the first 350 cases and the eventual attack rates of the first 200 hundred household outbreaks should be used to estimate the initial reproduction number R and the effectiveness of antiviral drugs to mitigate transmission. Use of antiviral drugs to mitigate general transmission should cease if these estimates indicate that containment of transmission is unlikely.",,Niels G Becker;Dingcheng Wang

This sudden rise in resistance seemed puzzling given the low overall level of the oseltamivir usage and the lack of a correlation between local rates of resistance and oseltamivir usage. We used a stochastic simulation model and deterministic approximations to examine how such events can occur, and in particular to determine how the rate of fixation of the resistant strain depends both on its fitness in untreated hosts as well as the frequency of antiviral treatment. We found that, for the levels of antiviral usage in the population, the resistant strain will eventually spread to fixation, if it is not attenuated in transmissibility relative to the drug-sensitive strain, but not at the speed observed in seasonal H1N1. The extreme speed with which the resistance spread in seasonal H1N1 suggests that the resistant strain had a transmission advantage in untreated hosts, and this could have arisen from genetic hitchhiking, or from the mutations responsible for resistance and compensation. Importantly, our model also shows that resistant virus will fail to spread if it is even slightly less transmissible than its sensitive counterpart--a finding of relevance given that resistant pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 may currently suffer from a small, but nonetheless experimentally perceptible reduction in transmissibility.",,Dennis L Chao;Jesse D Bloom;Beth F Kochin;Rustom Antia;Ira M Longini Jr

Surveillance data from the 28 health care providers (HCPs) in contact with the index case (mean age: 34.5 years; median time of contact: four hours, none receiving vaccine) revealed no evidence of transmission as detected by paired type-specific complement-fixation antibodies and throat culture (20 subjects) or acute serologies and culture (7 subjects).

Most notable of these viral strains are the H5N1 highly pathogenic AI and the H7N9 low pathogenicity AI viruses, both of which have mortality rates above 30%. Understanding of their mechanisms of infection and pathobiology is key to our preparation for these and future viral strains of high consequence. AI viruses typically circulate in wild bird populations, commonly infecting waterfowl and also regularly entering commercial poultry flocks. Live poultry markets provide an ideal environment for the spread AI and potentially the selection of mutants with a greater propensity for infecting humans because of the potential for spill over from birds to humans. Pathology from these AI virus infections is associated with a dysregulated immune response, which is characterized by systemic spread of the virus, lymphopenia, and hypercytokinemia. It has been well documented that host/pathogen interactions, particularly molecules of the immune system, play a significant role in both disease susceptibility as well as disease outcome. Here, we review the immune/virus interactions in both avian and mammalian species, and provide an overview or our understanding of how immune dysregulation is driven.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22323589/,Impact of cross-protective vaccines on epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of influenza,"Large-scale immunization has profoundly impacted control of many infectious diseases such as measles and smallpox because of the ability of vaccination campaigns to maintain long-term herd immunity and, hence, indirect protection of the unvaccinated. In the case of human influenza, such potential benefits of mass vaccination have so far proved elusive. The central difficulty is a considerable viral capacity for immune escape; new pandemic variants, as well as viral escape mutants in seasonal influenza, compromise the buildup of herd immunity from natural infection or deployment of current vaccines. Consequently, most current influenza vaccination programs focus mainly on protection of specific risk groups, rather than mass prophylactic protection. Here, we use epidemiological models to show that emerging vaccine technologies, aimed at broad-spectrum protection, could qualitatively alter this picture. We demonstrate that sustained immunization with such vaccines could--through potentially lowering transmission rates and improving herd immunity--significantly moderate both influenza pandemic and seasonal epidemics. More subtly, phylodynamic models indicate that widespread cross-protective immunization could slow the antigenic evolution of seasonal influenza; these effects have profound implications for a transition to mass vaccination strategies against human influenza, and for the management of antigenically variable viruses in general.",,Nimalan Arinaminpathy;Oliver Ratmann;Katia Koelle;Suzanne L Epstein;Graeme E Price;Cecile Viboud;Mark A Miller;Bryan T Grenfell

Judging its pandemic potential is difficult with limited data, but nevertheless essential to inform appropriate health responses. By analyzing the outbreak in Mexico, early data on international spread, and viral genetic diversity, we make an early assessment of transmissibility and severity. Our estimates suggest that 23,000 (range 6000 to 32,000) individuals had been infected in Mexico by late April, giving an estimated case fatality ratio (CFR) of 0.4% (range: 0.3 to 1.8%) based on confirmed and suspected deaths reported to that time. In a community outbreak in the small community of La Gloria, Veracruz, no deaths were attributed to infection, giving an upper 95% bound on CFR of 0.6%. Thus, although substantial uncertainty remains, clinical severity appears less than that seen in the 1918 influenza pandemic but comparable with that seen in the 1957 pandemic. Clinical attack rates in children in La Gloria were twice that in adults (<15 years of age: 61%; >/=15 years: 29%). Three different epidemiological analyses gave basic reproduction number (R0) estimates in the range of 1.4 to 1.6, whereas a genetic analysis gave a central estimate of 1.2.

Because of their population densities, urban areas will likely be affected earlier und more extensively. Therefore, the City of Munich started its preparations for a crisis situation early. The Division of Health and Environment of the City of Munich is the public health office responsible for putting plans into action. The main responsibilities are coordination and communication. Common measures to prevent and control infections on the basis of the Infectious Disease Control Act have to be implemented in a pandemic situation. The surveillance of influenza including laboratory diagnosis is highly sophisticated in Bavaria. Therapeutic means have developed significantly compared with the last pandemic in 1968. Nevertheless, at the peak of a pandemic, a shortage of personnel, hospital beds, vaccines and medications is expected. Priorities in the distribution of health resources should be defined in advance to help with decision making during the pandemic. Adequate communication with the public and all partners will be critical in order to reduce fear and unforeseen social disruption.",,C Dreweck;P Graf

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18076910/,Simple criteria for finding (nearly) optimal vaccination strategies,"Strategies for best controlling the spread of the diseases with limited vaccine available are explored. I use influenza as a representative disease in point. The model describes the dynamics of influenza spread among multiple groups that have different risks and activity levels. I define a core group consisting of individuals with occupations that brings them in contact with many other people in a day. These occupations may include service industries, teachers, health care, and government workers, to name a few. High-risk individuals are those as typically designated for: children under 5 and adults over 50, people with weakened immune systems as well as emergency and health care personnel. Under certain conditions, shifting vaccination resources away from the high-risk group to the high-activity group will result in improved herd immunity in both the high-risk group and the population as whole. This results in more high-risk people protected even though less of them are being vaccinated, with the obvious implications that current vaccination policies may be far less then optimal. I show that the criteria for the optimal strategy can be derived from simple expressions gleaned from the expression for the basic reproductive number.",,Stephen Tennenbaum

Determination of parameters that facilitate diagnosis and indicate severity would be useful to optimize treatment modalities. We prospectively screened 432 children for influenza infection. Forty-six children at the age of 4 weeks to 14 years (median, 18 months) with confirmed influenza A infection were analyzed. A clinical score of illness severity was calculated from the symptoms presented. To evaluate the dependency of the clinical score on C-reactive protein value, leukocyte count, age, and days of hospitalization, correlation and regression analyses were carried out. Neither the C-reactive protein values (median, 0.85 mg/dL; range, 0.2-18.6; r=0.14; p=0.35) nor the leukocyte counts (median, 7.95 G/L; range, 3.5-17.6; r=-0.14, p=0.34) correlated significantly with the clinical score of influenza severity.

Since the official reports of the evidence of infectious diseases did not give exact insight in the epidemiological events in 1918, a detailed analysis of the books of autopsy records of the Public health institutions has been done. The aim was to determine the very beginning of Spanish influenza in the city of Zagreb in 1918. It has been found that the first patients suffering from Spanish influenza appeared in July 1918. In the period from 1 September to the end of 1918, a total of 861 persons died because of Spanish influenza and complications caused by pneumonia. The analyzed autopsy records have demonstrated that the usual complication following influenza was pneumonia characterized by hemorrhagic edema.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24452021/,Population-level effects of suppressing fever,"Fever is commonly attenuated with antipyretic medication as a means to treat unpleasant symptoms of infectious diseases. We highlight a potentially important negative effect of fever suppression that becomes evident at the population level: reducing fever may increase transmission of associated infections. A higher transmission rate implies that a larger proportion of the population will be infected, so widespread antipyretic drug use is likely to lead to more illness and death than would be expected in a population that was not exposed to antipyretic pharmacotherapies. We assembled the published data available for estimating the magnitudes of these individual effects for seasonal influenza. While the data are incomplete and heterogeneous, they suggest that, overall, fever suppression increases the expected number of influenza cases and deaths in the US: for pandemic influenza with reproduction number , the estimated increase is 1% (95% CI: 0.0-2.7%), whereas for seasonal influenza with , the estimated increase is 5% (95% CI: 0.2-12.1%).",antipyretic drugs; fever; influenza; transmission.,David J D Earn;Paul W Andrews;Benjamin M Bolker
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17574162/,Bird flu: lessons from SARS,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza are two important newly emerged infections with pandemic potential. Both infections have crossed the species barrier to infect humans. SARS originated from southern China and spread to many countries in early 2003. The close collaboration of scientists around the world resulted in a rapid identification of the causative agent, and the early isolation of infected cases and meticulous infection control measures were the key to successfully controlling the outbreak of SARS. The first outbreak of human cases of avian influenza was reported in 1997 in Hong Kong. Since 2003, there have been many small outbreaks of human cases around the world, and the reported mortality is greater than 50%. Current evidence suggests that the human-to-human transmission of avian influenza is rather inefficient, but mutation might occur in the future resulting in improved transmission and possibly a pandemic in humans. As with the outbreak of SARS, the development of sensitive and accurate early diagnostic tests is extremely important for successful control of the outbreak at source. The availability of isolation facilities, the stockpiling of antiviral agents and effective and safe vaccination will be extremely important in minimising the damage of a new influenza pandemic.",,Gary W K Wong;Ting F Leung

Apart from the pandemic years, 1918-1919, 1957 and 1968-1969, annual excess mortality has occurred 16 times in Sweden during the period 1911-1988. An unusually high mortality was caused by Influenza A Sichuan 2/87 (H3N2), the unexpected appearance of which at the beginning of November 1988 started an intensive epidemic in Sweden, while other European countries had a relatively mild influenza season. Swedish deaths in December totalled 10,500-2,200 more than expected; age groups over 65 years accounted for 95 per cent of the mortality, and those over 80 (N = 350,000 in Sweden) for 1,400 deaths. 0.4 percent of those over 80 died. The excess mortality is to be explained by the high proportion of the elderly in the Swedish population and the very low rate of influenza vaccination before the outbreak. As the increase in the proportion of the very elderly can be expected to continue, future influenza epidemics will result in even higher mortality unless adequate prophylactic measures are taken.",,M Grandien;A Nilsson;L Hambraeus

These epidemiological features were similar between Japan and other countries. Attitudes and behaviors toward pandemic influenza control measures were different before and improved during and after the epidemic. These features were also similar to those in other countries. On the other hand, the epidemic spread through club activities or social events, and transmission was attenuated after temporary closure of such groups in Japan.

It is dependent on how virulent the virus is, how rapidly it spreads from population to population, and the effectiveness of prevention and response efforts. Despite the uncertainty about the magnitude of the next pandemic, estimates of the health and economic impact remain important to aid public health policy decisions and guide pandemic planning for health and emergency sectors. Planning ahead in preparation for an influenza pandemic, with its potentially very high morbidity and mortality rates, is essential for hospital administrators and public health officials. The estimation of pandemic impact is based on the previous pandemics--we had experienced at least 3 pandemics in 20th century. But the epidemiological characteristics--ie, start season, the impact of 1st wave, pathogenicity and virulence of the viruses and the primary victims of population were quite different from one another. I reviewed methodology for estimation and modelling of pandemic impact and described some nations's results using them in their national preparedness plans.

Increasing our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for this multi-wave profile has important public health implications. We model the transmission dynamics of two strains of influenza interacting via cross-immunity to simulate two temporal waves of influenza and explore the impact of the basic reproduction number, as a measure of transmissibility associated to each influenza strain, cross-immunity and the timing of the onset of the second influenza epidemic on the pandemic profile. We use time series of case notifications during the 1918 influenza pandemic in Geneva, Switzerland, for illustration. We calibrate our mathematical model to the initial wave of infection to estimate the basic reproduction number of the first wave and the corresponding timing of onset of the second influenza variant. We use this information to explore the impact of cross-immunity levels on the dynamics of the second wave of influenza. Our results for the 1918 pandemic in Geneva, Switzerland, indicate that a second wave can occur whenever R 01 < 1.5 or when cross-immunity levels are less than 0.58 for our estimated R 02 of 2.4. We also explore qualitatively profiles of two-wave pandemics and compare them with real temporal profiles of the 1918 influenza pandemic in other regions of the world including several Scandinavian cities, New York City, England and Wales, and Sydney, Australia. Pandemic profiles are classified into three broad categories namely ""right-handed"", ""left-handed"", and ""M-shape"".

After we confirmed the diagnosis of influenza by rapid diagnosis system (Directigen Flu A) or hemagglutinin inhibition test, neutralization test, comparison of costs was done between influenza patients (89 cases) and non influenza patients (212 cases). Mean cost of total medication and medical examinations were 14,800 +/- 980 yen for an influenza patient and 12,420 +/- 976 yen for a non influenza patient. This data showed that treatment of the influenza patient is more expensive than non influenza patient. It must be considered that prophylaxis with influenza vaccine and treatment with antiinfluenza drugs given in the early stage of influenza are useful for reducing medical costs.",,M Kaji;H Kuno;K Oizumi
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32911978/,Social and institutional Reactions to the Influenza Pandemic of 1918-20,"This essay challenges generalizations since the late enlightenment about the effects of epidemics and pandemics on collective mentalities: that from antiquity to the present, epidemics, regardless of the disease, have sparked distrust, social violence, and the blaming of others. By contrast, the pandemic that killed the greatest numbers in world history-the Influenza of 1918-20 - was a pandemic of compassion. No one has yet to uncover this pandemic sparking collective violence or blaming any minorities for spreading the disease anywhere in the globe. The essay then explores the variety of charitable reactions and abnegation that cut across social divisions in communities from theatres of war in Europe to nations thousands of miles from the direct military encounters. Most remarkable, however, was the overflowing volunteerism of women, especially in the US, Canada, and Australia. To explain this widespread charitable reaction, the essay investigates the milieu of the First World War, showing how that context in domestic war settings was not conducive to risking life to aid total strangers, especially when those strangers came from different foreign countries classes, races, or religious faiths. I end with a reflection on the unfolding socio-psychological reactions to Covid-19 from the perspective of 1918-20.",1918-20; Influenza Pandemic; blame; charity; women; world War I.,Samuel Kline Cohn

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17369367/,Long-standing influenza vaccination policy is in accord with individual self-interest but not with the utilitarian optimum,"Influenza vaccination is vital for reducing infection-mediated morbidity and mortality. To maximize effectiveness, vaccination programs must anticipate the effects of public perceptions and attitudes on voluntary adherence. A vaccine allocation strategy that is optimal for the population is not necessarily optimal for an individual. For epidemic influenza, the elderly have the greatest risk of influenza mortality, yet children are responsible for most of the transmission. The long-standing recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control follow the dictates of individual self-interest and prioritize the elderly for vaccination. However, preferentially vaccinating children may dramatically reduce community-wide influenza transmission. A potential obstacle to this is that the personal utility of vaccination is lower for children than it is for the elderly. We parameterize an epidemiological game-theoretic model of influenza vaccination with questionnaire data on actual perceptions of influenza and its vaccine to compare Nash equilibria vaccination strategies driven by self-interest with utilitarian strategies for both epidemic and pandemic influenza. Our results reveal possible strategies to bring Nash and utilitarian vaccination levels into alignment.",,Alison P Galvani;Timothy C Reluga;Gretchen B Chapman

This situation could become dramatically worse if the infectivity of avian viruses for humans were increased by reassortment between the genes of human and avian viruses. Co-infection of humans or an intermediate host with an avian strain and an existing human strain could produce new viruses of unknown pathogenicity to which the entire population would be susceptible. Inactivated vaccines against influenza have been prepared for many years using viruses grown in embryonated chicken eggs. However, the use of eggs presents difficulties when vaccine supplies need to be expanded at short notice. It seems likely that future vaccines will be prepared in high-yielding cell cultures from continuous lines that are preferably anchorage-independent. At present, only certain preparations of the Vero and Madin-Darby canine kidney cell lines, grown and maintained in serum-free medium, are acceptable to all regulatory authorities.

International efforts to prepare for a possible pandemic are underway. Priorities for pandemic planning include surveillance of influenza viruses in wild bird populations and at the avian-human interface, research into factors affecting the pathogenicity of these strains, stockpiling effective antivirals for use as a stopgap until an appropriate vaccine can be developed and distributed, and gaining an improved understanding of the utility of nonpharmaceutical interventions to slow or prevent the spread of these viruses within humans.

Because antiviral agents and vaccines will be unavailable to people in most countries, we need to determine whether other agents could offer clinical benefits. Influenza is associated with an increase in acute cardiovascular diseases, and influenza viruses induce proinflammatory cytokines. Statins are cardioprotective and have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, and they thus might benefit patients with influenza. This hypothesis should be evaluated by using administrative databases to search for reduced rates of hospitalization and death due to influenza-related conditions among people taking statins. These studies should be followed by laboratory studies of statins in animal and cell-based models of influenza virus infection and, later, by clinical trials. Positive results from such studies would provide physicians in all countries with something to offer patients for treatment and prophylaxis of pandemic influenza.

Contingency planning should, therefore, be multi-faceted, involving a robust health command structure, the facility to expand critical care provision in terms of space, equipment and staff and cohorting of affected patients in the early stages. It should also be recognised that despite this expansion of critical care, demand will exceed supply and a process for triage needs to be developed that is valid, reproducible, transparent and consistent with distributive justice.

It contains the case reports of influenza infected patients and the results of the bacteriological experiments. Dr. Schofield worked as a bacteriology professor in Severance Union Medical College in Seoul from 1916 to 1920. His academic activities are lesser-known than the role of contributor of Korean independent movement. However, he was a remarkable veterinarian and scientist. According to Dr. Schofield, the number of Influenza infected population in Korea in 1918 was supposed to be 4,000,000 to 8,000,000, which corresponds with other resources (6.7 per 1,000 in Gangwon province). Considering the cases which were not registered as influenza infection by misdiagnosis of pneumonia complication the sum should be higher. However, the estimated crude influenza death rate from the reports by the Japanese colonial government was only 2.38 (per 1,000). Dr. Schofield and his colleague tried to culture ""Pfeiffer Bacillus"" from the sputum and blood specimens of patients showing typical influenza symptoms. The bacterium was mistakenly considered as the influenza agent till the virological nature of influenza was discovered in the 1930s. From the results of his study he seemed to agree that ""filterable virus"" was the influenza agent and the secondary infection of the bacillus caused respiratory symptoms. He also reported on the influenza vaccination during the epidemics. Dr. Schofield's article confirms that the damage caused by the influenza outbreak in Korea was as great as in other Asian countries or even worse.

Although subjective, the virulence of influenza A (H1N1) 2009 can be perceived as mild. Further epidemiological investigations showed that both the cCFR and sCFR varied greatly by age and risk group.

Those affected include otherwise healthy individuals, and children with primary infections in particular. Much effort has been devoted to virological studies of influenza and vaccine development. By contrast, the enormous interindividual variability in susceptibility to influenza has received very little attention. One interesting hypothesis is that interindividual variability is driven largely by the genetic makeup of the infected patients. Unbiased genomic approaches have been used to search for genetic lesions in children with life-threatening pulmonary influenza. Four monogenic causes of severe influenza pneumonitis-deficiencies of GATA2, IRF7, IRF9, and TLR3-have provided evidence that severe influenza pneumonitis can be genetic and often in patients with no other severe infections. These deficiencies highlight the importance of human type I and III IFN-mediated immunity for host defense against influenza.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17968836/,Antivirals and the control of influenza outbreaks,"During annual influenza epidemics, outbreaks of influenza in closed institutions are common. Among healthy children or young adults, such outbreaks are uncommonly associated with serious morbidity or mortality; however, in hospitals and nursing homes, attack rates as high as 60% and case-fatality rates as high as 50% have been reported. Annual influenza vaccination of both patients or residents and hospital and nursing home staff has had a substantial impact on mortality and has reduced the number of outbreaks. Nonpharmacologic interventions (e.g., handwashing and contact isolation of case patients) may reduce the spread of influenza, although evidence for their efficacy is lacking. Nonetheless, long-term care facilities for the elderly population with high vaccination rates and better-than-average infection-control programs have a 25%-50% chance of experiencing an influenza outbreak each year, with an expected resident attack rate of 35%-40%. Thus, antiviral drugs have been increasingly used to mitigate the impact of influenza outbreaks. There are 2 classes of antiviral drugs that are active against influenza: adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors. Drugs of the 2 classes appear to be equally effective for the treatment and prophylaxis of susceptible influenza A virus strains. However, adamantanes are not active against influenza B virus, and an increasing proportion of influenza A isolates are resistant to adamantanes. Adamantanes are associated with higher rates of adverse events than are neuraminidase inhibitors. There is substantial evidence that antiviral prophylaxis is effective in terminating outbreaks of seasonal influenza in closed institutions. If stockpiles are adequate, antiviral drugs are likely to be even more important in mitigating the impact of influenza transmission in health care institutions during the next influenza pandemic.",,Susy Hota;Allison McGeer

Should a pandemic strain emerge, strain-specific estimates will be required as early as possible to ensure that antiviral stockpiles are used optimally and to compare the benefits of using antivirals as prophylaxis or to treat cases. We present a method to measure antiviral effectiveness using early pandemic data on household outbreak sizes, including households that are provided with antivirals for prophylaxis and those provided with antivirals for treatment only. We can assess whether antiviral drugs have a significant impact on susceptibility or on infectivity with the data from approximately 200 to 500 households with a primary case. Fewer households will suffice if the data can be collected before case numbers become high, and estimates are more precise if the study includes data from prophylaxed households and households where no antivirals are provided. Rates of asymptomatic infection and the level of transmissibility of the virus do not affect the accuracy of these estimates greatly, but the pattern of infectivity in the individual strongly influences the estimate of the effect of antivirals on infectivity.

Seasons with higher influenza mortality are associated with higher disease transmission and more rapid spread than are mild ones. The regional spread of infection correlates more closely with rates of movement of people to and from their workplaces (workflows) than with geographical distance. Workflows are described in turn by a gravity model, with a rapid decay of commuting up to around 100 km and a long tail of rare longer range flow. A simple epidemiological model, based on the gravity formulation, captures the observed increase of influenza spatial synchrony with transmissibility; high transmission allows influenza to spread rapidly beyond local spatial constraints.",,Cécile Viboud;Ottar N Bjørnstad;David L Smith;Lone Simonsen;Mark A Miller;Bryan T Grenfell

Here we review the biologic basis of this relationship, with special emphasis on the pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic effects of influenza infection. We also discuss the related epidemiologic findings and discuss in detail the possible causal relationship between influenza and cardiovascular disease. We appraise the relationship between influenza and coronary heart disease, on the basis of Bradford Hill's criteria of causality. We show that our proposed relationship meets the following criteria: strength of association, consistency, temporal sequence, coherence, biologic plausibility, experimental evidence, and analogy. Further studies are needed to assess whether it meets the criterion of biologic gradient. Specificity is not met, but meeting that criterion is of least importance in the study of multifactorial chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease. These criteria do not yield indisputable evidence for or against cause-and-effect, but they can help researchers appraise available evidence and determine the areas that need further research. The case for expanding the research on the effect of influenza on cardiovascular disease is a strong one, for most of Hill's criteria are met.",,Mohammad Madjid;Ibrahim Aboshady;Imran Awan;Silvio Litovsky;S Ward Casscells

The total morbidity, as estimated from the excess new claims to sickness benefit, was similar to that of the winter of 1967-68, in which a sharp outbreak of influenza virus A2 infection occurred.

We argue that these data are susceptible to various biases and should not be used as an outcome measure. Laboratory data are traditionally used to identify the presence of influenza activity rather than to identify levels of influenza activity. A better measure of viral activity is the proportion of influenza tests positive; whereas the weekly proportion of tests positive was relatively consistent, a marked increase over time in the numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases paralleled an increase in the number of tests performed.

Weekly data from December 2017 to May 2018 are obtained from the data base of the Centre of Health Protection in Hong Kong, and used to parametrise the models. With the help of these models, we investigate the impact of different vaccination strategies and determine the corresponding critical vaccination coverage for different vaccine efficacies. The results suggest that at least 72% of Hong Kong population should have been vaccinated during 2017-2018 winter to prevent the seasonal epidemic by herd immunity (while data showed that only a maximum of 11.6% of the population were vaccinated).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25815321/,Current and emerging cell culture manufacturing technologies for influenza vaccines,"Annually, influenza virus infects millions of people worldwide. Vaccination programs against seasonal influenza infections require the production of hundreds of million doses within a very short period of time. The influenza vaccine is currently produced using a technology developed in the 1940s that relies on replicating the virus in embryonated hens' eggs. The monovalent viral preparation is inactivated and purified before being formulated in trivalent or tetravalent influenza vaccines. The production process has depended on a continuous supply of eggs. In the case of pandemic outbreaks, this mode of production might be problematic because of a possible drastic reduction in the egg supply and the low flexibility of the manufacturing process resulting in a lack of supply of the required vaccine doses in a timely fashion. Novel production systems using mammalian or insect cell cultures have emerged to overcome the limitations of the egg-based production system. These industrially well-established production systems have been primarily selected for a faster and more flexible response to pandemic threats. Here, we review the most important cell culture manufacturing processes that have been developed in recent years for mass production of influenza vaccines.",,Ernest Milián;Amine A Kamen
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17115950/,The influenza viruses,"Human epidemic influenza is caused by influenza type A and B viruses, which continually undergo antigenic change in their surface antigens, haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Influenza epidemics are the consequence of small, ongoing antigenic changes known as ""antigenic drift"", which occurs in both influenza types. Pandemic influenza occurs at irregular and unpredictable intervals, and is the result of a major antigenic change known as ""antigenic shift"", which occurs only in influenza A. Aquatic birds are the evolutionary hosts of influenza viruses; they harbour many distinct forms or subtypes of influenza A, which are usually present as harmless gut infections. Antigenic shift involves the evolution of a new human influenza A virus through the acquisition of a new haemagglutinin gene encoding a different subtype from an avian influenza, or by the adaptation of an avian virus, causing it to become transmissible between humans. Two subtypes of avian influenza, H5 and H7, can cause severe infections when introduced into domestic poultry. Recently, influenza A/H5N1 viruses have caused widespread outbreaks, starting in Asia and spreading widely to other regions. Avian influenza viruses do not readily infect humans. However, during the past 3 years, more than 250 cases of H5N1 infection of humans have occurred, with associated mortality approaching 60%. It is feared that a new pandemic of human influenza may emerge from this.",,Alan W Hampson;John S Mackenzie

Asthma and chronic diseases enhance the risk in children in the same proportions as observed in adults. Influenza may lead to death, infants aged 0-6 months being the most affected. Young children with influenza exhibit a non specific respiratory illness and often non respiratory manifestations (isolated fever, GI tract illness, convulsions). Influenza rapid ""doctor tests"" are now available and may be used at the physician's surgery. Treating fever is the most important purpose. Aspirin use should be avoided due to an increased risk of Reye syndrome. Antibiotic prescription is not indicated, except in case of bacterial super infection.

For instance, there are now eight paramyxoviruses, four coronaviruses and four orthomxoviruses that cause recurrent epidemics in humans but were once confined to other hosts. In the last decade, several members of the same virus families have jumped the species barrier from animals to humans. Fortunately, these viruses have not become established in humans, because they lacked the ability of sustained transmission between humans. However, these outbreaks highlighted the lack of understanding of what makes a virus transmissible. In part triggered by the relatively high frequency of occurrence of influenza A virus zoonoses and pandemics, the influenza research community has started to investigate the viral genetic and biological traits that drive virus transmission via aerosols or respiratory droplets between mammals. Here we summarize recent discoveries on the genetic and phenotypic traits required for airborne transmission of zoonotic influenza viruses of subtypes H5, H7 and H9 and pandemic viruses of subtypes H1, H2 and H3.

The great pandemic of 1918-1919 changed all that, and the possibility that such a catastrophe could occur again has conditioned all subsequent developments. In epidemiological terms, the hallmark of an influenza is the excess mortality that it causes combined with an enormous burden of ill-health that saps the energy of individuals, families and communities throughout the whole world. In order to engage in influenza prevention and control, the global influenza surveillance network was set up by World Health Organization (WHO) in 1948 as a worldwide alert system for the identification of new influenza viruses, gathering information from 110 participating laboratories in 82 countries and four WHO Collaborating Centers for Influenza reference and research: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta (USA), National Institute for Medical Research, London (UK), WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza Reference and Research, Melbourne (Australia) and the National Institute for Infectious Diseases, Tokyo (Japan).

Each year, information about the isolates over the previous 12 months is analyzed and used to determine the composition of the influenza vaccine to be administered during the coming influenza season both for the northern and southern hemisphere. If necessary, the recommendations for the southern hemisphere differ from the ones formulated for the northern hemisphere vaccine. The information supplied by this network enables the organization to regularly update its World Wide Web (WWW) site (FluNet), which reports on the situation of diseases. This network will also enable the WHO to detect a new influenza pandemic as early as possible.",,M E Kitler;P Gavinio;D Lavanchy

The diagnosis of influenza (H1N1) 2009 infection was based on positive results of a real-time polymerase chain reaction. No patient was diagnosed as having a bacterial infection. The average arterial PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio was significantly decreased to 126. Atelectasis was revealed by chest X-ray in 90.3% of subjects. There was one plastic bronchitis patient. Anti-influenza drugs were used at an average of 14.9 h after onset. Five patients showed abnormal behavior as a complication of encephalopathy. We found that respiratory failure progressed rapidly.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17318677/,Impact of travel between patches for spatial spread of disease,"A multipatch model is proposed to study the impact of travel on the spatial spread of disease between patches with different level of disease prevalence. The basic reproduction number for the ith patch in isolation is obtained along with the basic reproduction number of the system of patches, Re(0). Inequalities describing the relationship between these numbers are also given. For a two-patch model with one high prevalence patch and one low prevalence patch, results pertaining to the dependence of Re(0) on the travel rates between the two patches are obtained. For parameter values relevant for influenza, these results show that, while banning travel of infectives from the low to the high prevalence patch always contributes to disease control, banning travel of symptomatic travelers only from the high to the low prevalence patch could adversely affect the containment of the outbreak under certain ranges of parameter values. Moreover, banning all travel of infected individuals from the high to the low prevalence patch could result in the low prevalence patch becoming diseasefree, while the high prevalence patch becomes even more disease-prevalent, with the resulting number of infectives in this patch alone exceeding the combined number of infectives in both patches without border control. Under the set of parameter values used, our results demonstrate that if border control is properly implemented, then it could contribute to stopping the spatial spread of disease between patches.",,Ying-Hen Hsieh;P van den Driessche;Lin Wang

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24048220/,Dynamically correlated mutations drive human Influenza A evolution,"Human Influenza A virus undergoes recurrent changes in the hemagglutinin (HA) surface protein, primarily involved in the human antibody recognition. Relevant antigenic changes, enabling the virus to evade host immune response, have been recognized to occur in parallel to multiple mutations at antigenic sites in HA. Yet, the role of correlated mutations (epistasis) in driving the molecular evolution of the virus still represents a challenging puzzle. Further, though circulation at a global geographic level is key for the survival of Influenza A, its role in shaping the viral phylodynamics remains largely unexplored. Here we show, through a sequence based epidemiological model, that epistatic effects between amino acids substitutions, coupled with a reservoir that mimics worldwide circulating viruses, are key determinants that drive human Influenza A evolution. Our approach explains all the up-to-date observations characterizing the evolution of H3N2 subtype, including phylogenetic properties, nucleotide fixation patterns, and composition of antigenic clusters.",,F Tria;S Pompei;V Loreto
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12387924/,An endemic model with variable re-infection rate and applications to influenza,"An epidemic model is considered, where immunity is not absolute, but individuals that have recovered from the disease can be re-infected at a rate which depends on the time that has passed since their recovery (recovery age). Such a model, e.g., can account for the genetic drift in the influenza virus. In the special case that the model has no vital dynamics, there is no obvious disease-free equilibrium and so the model lacks the usual interplay between the basic replacement ratio being >1 and the disease-free equilibrium being unstable. In fact, this relatively simple model which combines ordinary differential equations with a transport equation shares with general structured population models the feature that the appropriate state space of the solution semiflow is a space of measures, here on the compacted right real half line, with the weak* topology. The disease-free equilibrium, in terms of recovered individuals, is then represented as a Dirac measure concentrated at infinity. Still it is difficult to linearize about it. This makes the concept of persistence very important, for one can show the following: if the basic replacement ratio is >1, the disease is uniformly strongly persistent, i.e., the number of infectives is ultimately bounded away from 0 with the bound not depending on the initial data. We also derive various conditions for the local and global stability of the endemic equilibrium in terms of the re-infection rate. For instance, the endemic equilibrium is likely to be locally asymptotically stable if the re-infection rate is a highly sub-homogeneous function of recovery age. Conversely, if the re-infection rate is a step function which is zero at small recovery age, the endemic equilibrium can be unstable.",,Horst R Thieme;Jinling Yang

In this essay we argue that GOF-type experiments have already produced important information not available from any other source while also providing information on pathogenesis and the requirements for optimizing strains for vaccine production. We analyze the moral arguments against GOF and find them less compelling for a variety of reasons ranging from the uncertainty of risk-benefit analysis to the reduced likelihood of accidents given the enhanced biosafety and biosecurity protocols currently in place. In our view the most important consequence of the GOF debate is that it brought renewed attention to biosafety protocols and ushered innovation in answering the relevant biological questions with greater safety.

We introduce the concept of the epidemic prevention potential (EPP) as a measure of the ability of an intervention to either prevent transmission or at least to keep it below a pre-defined limit. As a concept to describe the general ability of an intervention to limit outbreaks to a certain defined size, the term EPP fills a void.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17416677/,The effect of public health measures on the 1918 influenza pandemic in U.S. cities,"During the 1918 influenza pandemic, the U.S., unlike Europe, put considerable effort into public health interventions. There was also more geographic variation in the autumn wave of the pandemic in the U.S. compared with Europe, with some cities seeing only a single large peak in mortality and others seeing double-peaked epidemics. Here we examine whether differences in the public health measures adopted by different cities can explain the variation in epidemic patterns and overall mortality observed. We show that city-specific per-capita excess mortality in 1918 was significantly correlated with 1917 per-capita mortality, indicating some intrinsic variation in overall mortality, perhaps related to sociodemographic factors. In the subset of 23 cities for which we had partial data on the timing of interventions, an even stronger correlation was found between excess mortality and how early in the epidemic interventions were introduced. We then fitted an epidemic model to weekly mortality in 16 cities with nearly complete intervention-timing data and estimated the impact of interventions. The model reproduced the observed epidemic patterns well. In line with theoretical arguments, we found the time-limited interventions used reduced total mortality only moderately (perhaps 10-30%), and that the impact was often very limited because of interventions being introduced too late and lifted too early. San Francisco, St. Louis, Milwaukee, and Kansas City had the most effective interventions, reducing transmission rates by up to 30-50%. Our analysis also suggests that individuals reactively reduced their contact rates in response to high levels of mortality during the pandemic.",,Martin C J Bootsma;Neil M Ferguson

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23505366/,Environmental predictors of seasonal influenza epidemics across temperate and tropical climates,"Human influenza infections exhibit a strong seasonal cycle in temperate regions. Recent laboratory and epidemiological evidence suggests that low specific humidity conditions facilitate the airborne survival and transmission of the influenza virus in temperate regions, resulting in annual winter epidemics. However, this relationship is unlikely to account for the epidemiology of influenza in tropical and subtropical regions where epidemics often occur during the rainy season or transmit year-round without a well-defined season. We assessed the role of specific humidity and other local climatic variables on influenza virus seasonality by modeling epidemiological and climatic information from 78 study sites sampled globally. We substantiated that there are two types of environmental conditions associated with seasonal influenza epidemics: ""cold-dry"" and ""humid-rainy"". For sites where monthly average specific humidity or temperature decreases below thresholds of approximately 11-12 g/kg and 18-21°C during the year, influenza activity peaks during the cold-dry season (i.e., winter) when specific humidity and temperature are at minimal levels. For sites where specific humidity and temperature do not decrease below these thresholds, seasonal influenza activity is more likely to peak in months when average precipitation totals are maximal and greater than 150 mm per month. These findings provide a simple climate-based model rooted in empirical data that accounts for the diversity of seasonal influenza patterns observed across temperate, subtropical and tropical climates.",,James D Tamerius;Jeffrey Shaman;Wladimir J Alonso;Kimberly Bloom-Feshbach;Christopher K Uejio;Andrew Comrie;Cécile Viboud

The virus was identified soon after to be a swine-origin influenza virus A (S-OIV A) (H1N1). This virus has an HA gene that is derived from the 1918 swine influenza virus and other genes from human, avian, and Eurasian swine influenza viruses. Clinically, it behaves similarly to seasonal influenza. The only differentiating characteristics are vomiting and diarrhea in a quarter of infected patients, which are rare in seasonal influenza. On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization declared the first pandemic of the 21st century, caused by S-OIV A (H1N1). Vaccination is the only way to dampen this pandemic. Many questions await answers, including the clinical impact of the pandemic, optimal doses of vaccine, and the future destiny of the virus.

Its prevention consists of strain specific vaccination, which must be repeated annually due to the high antigenic variability of the influenza virus. Influenza may represent an important obstacle to military readiness, particularly when considering its infectivity within closed communities. Despite such epidemiological situations, influenza vaccination is seldom included in the compulsory vaccination programme of the military on a global level. This may be due to several reasons, namely, a lack of confidence in the vaccine's effectiveness, the need for annual administrations (with expansion of economic and organisational efforts), false assumption that influenza is a disease with a minor impact, contradictory results of cost-effectiveness analyses (examples of which have yet to be made specifically for the military environment).

However, infection of turkeys with swine H1N1 viruses has been documented on several occasions. This report documents the isolation of an H1N2 influenza virus from a turkey breeder flock with a sudden drop in egg production. Sequence analysis of the virus showed that it was a complex reassortant virus with a mix of swine-, human-, and avian-origin influenza genes. A swine influenza virus with a similar gene complement was recently reported from pigs in Indiana. Isolation and identification of the virus required the use of nonconventional diagnostic procedures. The virus was isolated in embryonated chicken eggs by the yolk sac route of inoculation rather than by the typical chorioallantoic sac route. Interpretation of hemagglutination-inhibition test results required the use of turkey rather than chicken red blood cells, and identification of the neuraminidase subtype required the use of alternative reference sera in the neuraminidase-inhibition test.

In 1957 and 1968, new influenza viruses emerged into the human population and spread globally. Those pandemics were associated with high rates of illness and mortality, but both paled in comparison with the influenza pandemic of 1918. Reconstruction of the 1918 pandemic virus and studies to elucidate the exceptional virulence of the virus will be important steps toward understanding virulent influenza strains. One approach has been to reconstruct recombinant viruses, in which genes of the 1918 virus are replaced with genes from contemporary human influenza viruses in attempts to understand which of the eight virus gene segments contribute to its high virulence. The identification of the precise pandemic virus genes associated with replication may help elucidate virulence factors for other influenza viruses with pandemic potential and, thereby, help identify targets for drug intervention. An important role of antiviral drugs during an influenza pandemic will be to slow virus replication and subsequent spread while an appropriate vaccine is in production. The topics included in this review highlight areas of active research into the understanding of what made the 1918 pandemic influenza virus so virulent and transmissible. Such research is being done with the hope that the knowledge gained will allow the world to better prepare for and respond to future influenza pandemics.",,Lucy A Perrone;Terrence M Tumpey

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23526970/,Skip the trip: air travelers' behavioral responses to pandemic influenza,"Theory suggests that human behavior has implications for disease spread. We examine the hypothesis that individuals engage in voluntary defensive behavior during an epidemic. We estimate the number of passengers missing previously purchased flights as a function of concern for swine flu or A/H1N1 influenza using 1.7 million detailed flight records, Google Trends, and the World Health Organization's FluNet data. We estimate that concern over ""swine flu,"" as measured by Google Trends, accounted for 0.34% of missed flights during the epidemic. The Google Trends data correlates strongly with media attention, but poorly (at times negatively) with reported cases in FluNet. Passengers show no response to reported cases. Passengers skipping their purchased trips forwent at least $50 M in travel related benefits. Responding to actual cases would have cut this estimate in half. Thus, people appear to respond to an epidemic by voluntarily engaging in self-protection behavior, but this behavior may not be responsive to objective measures of risk. Clearer risk communication could substantially reduce epidemic costs. People undertaking costly risk reduction behavior, for example, forgoing nonrefundable flights, suggests they may also make less costly behavior adjustments to avoid infection. Accounting for defensive behaviors may be important for forecasting epidemics, but linking behavior with epidemics likely requires consideration of risk communication.",,Eli P Fenichel;Nicolai V Kuminoff;Gerardo Chowell

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19768412/,Pandemic influenza vaccines,"Since their compositions remain uncertain, universal pandemic vaccines are yet to be created. They would aim to protect globally against pandemic influenza viruses that have not yet evolved. Thus they differ from seasonal vaccines to influenza virus, which are updated annually in spring to incorporate the latest circulating viruses, and are then produced and delivered before the peak influenza season starts in late fall and winter. The efficacy of seasonal vaccines is linked to their ability to induce virus-neutralizing antibodies, which provide subtype-specific protection against influenza A viruses. If pandemic vaccines were designed to resemble current vaccines in terms of composition and mode of action, they would have to be developed, tested, and mass-produced after the onset of a pandemic, once the causative virus had been identified. The logistic problems of generating a pandemic vaccine from scratch, conducting preclinical testing, and producing billions of doses within a few months for global distribution are enormous and may well be insurmountable. Alternatively, the scientific community could step up efforts to generate a universal vaccine against influenza A viruses that provides broadly cross-reactive protection through the induction of antibodies or T cells to conserved regions of the virus.",,Lauren J DiMenna;Hildegund C J Ertl

In Ohio, from July 28 to September 25, 2012, a total of 106 confirmed H3N2v cases were identified through enhanced surveillance. Whereas most H3N2v patients experienced mild, self-limited influenza-like illness (ILI), 11 of the Ohio patients were hospitalized, representing 69% of all H3N2v hospitalizations in the United States. Of these hospitalized H3N2v patients, six were at increased risk for influenza complications because of age or underlying medical conditions, including the only H3N2v-associated fatality reported in the United States to date. This report summarizes the epidemiology and clinical features of the 11 hospitalized H3N2v patients in Ohio. These findings reinforce the recommendation for persons at high risk for influenza complications to avoid swine exposure at agricultural fairs this fall.

Such policies involve three key decisions: when, over what geographical scale, and how long to keep schools closed. Our evaluation includes uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, as well as model output uncertainties arising from variability in serial intervals and presumed modifications of social contacts during school dismissal periods. During the period before vaccines become widely available, school dismissals are particularly effective in delaying the epidemic peak, typically by 4-6 days for each additional week of dismissal. Assuming the surveillance is able to correctly and promptly diagnose at least 5-10% of symptomatic individuals within the jurisdiction, dismissals at the city or county level yield the greatest reduction in disease incidence for a given dismissal duration for all but the most severe pandemic scenarios considered here. Broader (multi-county) dismissals should be considered for the most severe and fast-spreading (1918-like) pandemics, in which multi-month closures may be necessary to delay the epidemic peak sufficiently to allow for vaccines to be implemented.",EpiCast; Pandemic influenza; School dismissal; Stochastic individual-based model.,Timothy C Germann;Hongjiang Gao;Manoj Gambhir;Andrew Plummer;Matthew Biggerstaff;Carrie Reed;Amra Uzicanin

The 2009 H1N1 virus spread initially to the United States and Canada, with subsequent rapid global dissemination, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare ""a public health emergency of international concern"" in April 2009, and upgrading the viral threat to pandemic status in June 2009. Despite initial fears, the severity of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic overall did not differ significantly from that of seasonal influenza. However, the demographics of those at risk of severe illness did differ (affecting children and young adults, rather than the very young and the very old). The 2009 H1N1 pandemic led to rapid implementation of health care initiatives, including the provision of critical care services, to limit the effect of the influenza outbreak on the community.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17460037/,The generation of influenza outbreaks by a network of host immune responses against a limited set of antigenic types,"It is commonly believed that influenza epidemics arise through the incremental accumulation of viral mutations, culminating in a novel antigenic type that is able to escape host immunity. Successive epidemic strains therefore become increasingly antigenically distant from a founding strain. Here, we present an alternative explanation where, because of functional constraints on the defining epitopes, the virus population is characterized by a limited set of antigenic types, all of which may be continuously generated by mutation from preexisting strains and other processes. Under these circumstances, influenza outbreaks arise as a consequence of host immune selection in a manner that is independent of the mode and tempo of viral mutation. By contrast with existing paradigms, antigenic distance between epidemic strains does not necessarily accumulate with time in our model, and it is the changing profile of host population immunity that creates the conditions for the emergence of the next influenza strain rather than the mutational capabilities of the virus.",,Mario Recker;Oliver G Pybus;Sean Nee;Sunetra Gupta

In addition, delays in oseltamivir administration, higher ages and comorbidities and low vaccination rates in patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection were found during the first postpandemic season.

Good evidence of the efficacy, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination underlines the recommendation of use in patients with COPD. Influenza vaccination could reduce influenza-related complications and exacerbations in patients with COPD, therefore reducing hospitalizations and deaths. Each year, all persons with COPD should be vaccinated with the inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine containing the most frequent two influenza A viral strains and one influenza B viral strain detected in the influenza season of the previous year. To achieve a 100% vaccination rate in patients with COPD, all patients with COPD registered in health insurance companies and attended in health centers and specialized clinics should be vaccinated during the immunization period (October-December). Antiviral therapies could be used as an adjunct to vaccination and to reduce influenza transmission in outbreaks.

The role of vaccination is also studied taking into account delays in access and limitations in the total and daily numbers of vaccines available. The research in this article supports the view that the three epidemic ""waves"" are the result of the synergistic interactions of three factors: regional movement patterns of Mexicans, the impact and effectiveness of dramatic social distancing measures imposed during the first outbreak, and the summer release of school children followed by their subsequent return to classes in the fall. The three ""waves"" cannot be explained by the transportation patterns alone but only through the combination of transport patterns and changes in contact rates due to the use of explicit or scheduled social distancing measures.

Consultant pharmacists gathered data on patient demographics, ILI status, vaccination for influenza and streptococcal pneumonia, diagnosis of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and utilization of health care services related to ILI. Services included the use of antimicrobials, antivirals, and respiratory drugs; emergency room visits; diagnostic tests; hospitalizations; and medically related transportation. Costs were based on average wholesale prices (for drugs) and Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement rates. Data were collected for 551 patients.

In turn, the suite of varying individual infection histories will shape the population level dynamics of the disease. Exploring the consequences of precisely how immunity is acquired using mathematical models has proven challenging though: if n strains have circulated previously, there are 2(n) combinations of past infection to consider. However, by using an age-structured mathematical model of a disease with multiple strains, we can examine the population immune profile without explicitly keeping track of all possible infection histories. This framework allows previously unknown consequences of assumptions about immune acquisition to be observed. In particular, we see that 'original antigenic sin' can reduce immunity in some age groups: these immune blind spots could be responsible for the unexpectedly high severity of certain past influenza epidemics.",,Adam J Kucharski;Julia R Gog

The expert panel reviewed estimates and discussed differences in data sources, analysis, and modeling assumptions. We performed a comparison analysis of the estimates. Influenza-associated respiratory death counts were comparable between CDC and GLaMOR; the IHME estimate was considerably lower. The greatest country-specific influenza-associated fold differences in mortality rate between CDC and IHME estimates and between GLaMOR and IHME estimates were among countries in Southeast Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean region. The data envelope used for the calculation was one of the major differences (CDC and GLaMOR: all respiratory deaths; IHME: lower-respiratory infection deaths). With the assumption that there is only one cause of death for each death, IHME estimates a fraction of the full influenza-associated respiratory mortality that is measured by the other 2 groups. Wide variability of parameters was observed. Continued coordination between groups could assist with better understanding of methodological differences and new approaches to estimating influenza deaths globally.",comparison; estimates; global; influenza; mortality.,Vanessa Cozza;Harry Campbell;Howard H Chang;A Danielle Iuliano;John Paget;Neha N Patel;Robert C Reiner;Chris Troeger;Cecile Viboud;Joseph S Bresee;Julia Fitzner

However, these tests cannot detect oseltamivir resistance, susceptibility testing being carried out only in specialist laboratories. Although resistance is rare, it can emerge during treatment, especially of very young children or immunocompromised patients. In the latter, the shedding of resistant influenza virus can last several weeks. Sporadic instances of nosocomial transmission among immunocompromised patients have been reported. The limitations of bedside tests for influenza make them unsuitable for use as stand-alone diagnostic tools. However, their limitations do not preclude their use for detection and subsequent management of nosocomial influenza, for which they are rapid, easy, and cost-effective.

Contemporaneous records suggest that immunopathologic responses were a critical determinant of the high mortality rate among young adults and other high-risk subgroups. Historical records and findings from laboratory animal studies suggest that persons who were exposed to influenza once before 1918 (e.g., A/H3Nx 1890 pandemic strain) were likely to have dysregulated, pathologic cellular immune responses to infections with the A/H1N1 1918 pandemic strain. The immunopathologic effects transiently increased susceptibility to ultimately lethal secondary bacterial pneumonia.

In April 2011, the Ohio Department of Health and CDC investigated an influenza outbreak that began in February 2011 in a residential facility for 130 children and young adults with neurologic and neurodevelopmental conditions. This report summarizes the characteristics and clinical courses of 13 severely ill residents with suspected or confirmed influenza; 10 were hospitalized, and seven died. Diagnosis is challenging in this population, and clinicians should consider influenza in patients with neurologic and neurodevelopmental conditions who have respiratory illness or a decline in baseline medical status when influenza is circulating in the community. Prompt testing, early and aggressive antiviral treatment, and antiviral chemoprophylaxis are important for these patients. When influenza is suspected, antiviral treatment should be given as soon as possible after symptom onset, ideally within 48 hours. Treatment should not wait for laboratory confirmation of influenza. During outbreaks, antiviral chemoprophylaxis should be provided to all residents of institutional facilities (e.g., nursing homes and long-term- care facilities), regardless of vaccination status. Residential facilities for patients with neurologic and neurodevelopmental conditions are encouraged to vaccinate all eligible residents and staff members against influenza.",,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

Influenza virus infections not only disrupt eustachian tube function, but also impair recovery from infection and facilitate attachment of bacterial pathogens to respiratory epithelial cells. Immunization of young children with either inactivated or live, attenuated influenza vaccine will significantly reduce the incidence of acute otitis media. Early treatment of influenza with antiviral medication will reduce eustachian tube dysfunction that results from influenza virus infection. Influenza produces high morbidity in children that could be averted by universal immunization with attenuated nasal spray vaccine.",,W P Glezen

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10623371/,Individual and community impact of influenza,"Influenza has been recognised as a distinct entity for centuries because of its profound effect on respiratory morbidity and mortality, although the full burden of the disease has been difficult to determine. The population groups most affected by influenza morbidity and mortality have also been recognised for years and are strongly related to the viral type or subtype circulating. Studies in the US suggest that the traditional pneumonia and influenza (P&I) mortality rate underestimates the total impact of influenza on mortality by a factor of approximately 3.8. Observations in different parts of the world confirm that mortality associated with P&I is not limited to specific countries. Vaccination not only reduces the severity of illness and death from P&I, but also reduces all-cause mortality, thus confirming these observations. Estimates of overall morbidity vary widely, depending on the methods used in various observational studies. The actual impact of influenza is likely to be within this range of estimates, but recent vaccination studies suggest the possibility of much higher rates of morbidity than previously estimated.",,A S Monto
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6736641/,Age and secular distributions of virus-proven influenza patients in successive epidemics 1961-1976 in Cirencester: epidemiological significance discussed,"A general practice population of around 3900, under continuous clinical and laboratory surveillance, experienced 20 outbreaks of influenza between March 1960 and March 1976. Four epidemics were caused by subtype H2N2 type A viruses, seven by subtype H3N2 type A viruses and nine outbreaks by type B viruses. The age of every person proved virologically to have influenza is related to the age structure of the community and to the phase of the epidemic in which the virus-positive specimens were collected. Children 0-15 years old suffered a higher incidence rate than adults 16-90+. Pre-school children 0-4 suffered the highest rate of infection by viruses of both influenza A subtypes, whereas older schoolchildren 10-15 suffered the highest rate of type B infections. Despite these high incidence rates neither pre-school nor schoolchildren appear to have been the major disseminators of any of these influenza viruses in the community. Adults of all ages suffered a high rate of infection even into extreme old age, and the indiscriminate age distribution among adults was sustained in the successive epidemics. Such age-patterns are not those caused by a highly infectious immunizing virus surviving by means of direct transmissions from the sick, whose prompt development of the disease continues endless chains of transmissions. An alternative epidemic mechanism--whereby the virus does not spread from the sick but becomes latent in them, reactivating seasonally so that they later infect their companions--would produce age patterns similar to those recorded here for influenza patients. The suggested mechanism is illustrated by a simple conceptual model and the influenzal age patterns are discussed in relation to the recycling of influenza A subtypes.",,R E Hope-Simpson

In college students who reported to the Vanderbilt student health service, roughly equivalent amounts of typical influenzal disease were documented by virus isolation and total health service visits with both strains. However, considering that the college population was fully susceptible to the first introduction of H1N1 virus in 20 years and partially immune to H3N2 viruses through repeated exposure, A/USSR appeared to be a relatively less pathogenic strain. Stronger proof of this was seen in a closely monitored group of 200 largely seronegative infants and young children less than 4 years of age enrolled in an experimental vaccine clinic. In this young population, A/USSR caused no recognizable illness and A/Texas caused typical febrile respiratory disease. Thus, two influenza strains circulating in close temporal association differed in virulence when observed in carefully monitored susceptible populations.",,P F Wright;J Thompson;D T Karzon
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21347316/,Mitigation strategies for pandemic influenza A: balancing conflicting policy objectives,"Mitigation of a severe influenza pandemic can be achieved using a range of interventions to reduce transmission. Interventions can reduce the impact of an outbreak and buy time until vaccines are developed, but they may have high social and economic costs. The non-linear effect on the epidemic dynamics means that suitable strategies crucially depend on the precise aim of the intervention. National pandemic influenza plans rarely contain clear statements of policy objectives or prioritization of potentially conflicting aims, such as minimizing mortality (depending on the severity of a pandemic) or peak prevalence or limiting the socio-economic burden of contact-reducing interventions. We use epidemiological models of influenza A to investigate how contact-reducing interventions and availability of antiviral drugs or pre-pandemic vaccines contribute to achieving particular policy objectives. Our analyses show that the ideal strategy depends on the aim of an intervention and that the achievement of one policy objective may preclude success with others, e.g., constraining peak demand for public health resources may lengthen the duration of the epidemic and hence its economic and social impact. Constraining total case numbers can be achieved by a range of strategies, whereas strategies which additionally constrain peak demand for services require a more sophisticated intervention. If, for example, there are multiple objectives which must be achieved prior to the availability of a pandemic vaccine (i.e., a time-limited intervention), our analysis shows that interventions should be implemented several weeks into the epidemic, not at the very start. This observation is shown to be robust across a range of constraints and for uncertainty in estimates of both R(0) and the timing of vaccine availability. These analyses highlight the need for more precise statements of policy objectives and their assumed consequences when planning and implementing strategies to mitigate the impact of an influenza pandemic.",,T Déirdre Hollingsworth;Don Klinkenberg;Hans Heesterbeek;Roy M Anderson

In the absence of effective policies of prevention and cure, there is a need for a system which will constantly survey the scene on a clinical basis and give an early warning of an impending epidemic. The means hitherto available have been crude and rather slow to react. A system is described which is based on weekly telephoned reports from a geographically widely spread network of general practitioners, mainly in Tayside. The co-ordinated system operates during the influenza 'season', and provides information to the contributors, health planners, epidemiologists and to WHO. Examples of the work of the 'spotter practices' are drawn from the season 1980-81. The material is validated by virological sampling studies, by the internal consistency of the figures, and by reference to what is happening in other geographical areas.

The flu is not of importance only in health problems but also in the economic ones, such as the treatment costs and patients' ability to work. We focused particularly on the most effective preventive measure against the virus, which is vaccination and the risk groups that are the most vulnerable ones to the virus. One of the objectives of this research was to identify the advantages and disadvantages of vaccination against influenza and available risks of vaccination within a group of 390 patients. We studied a group of 195 vaccinated patients and we tried to determine the effect of the vaccines used in these patients, and to compare this group with the same number of unvaccinated patients. The goal of the research was to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the vaccination against influenza, and the potential risks resulting from the vaccination. Based on our results, we found out that out of 195 vaccinated patients, only 4% returned to the doctor with the flu. Unvaccinated patients, however, visited the doctor four times more frequently, regardless of age. The resulting morbidity ratios clearly showed the importance, effectiveness and safety of the vaccination not only in high-risk groups, but also in people that are ""out-of-danger"", because the current flu virus spreads by droplet infection very quickly. Appropriate education and increased awareness among the population in Slovakia could improve the general attitude towards the vaccination against influenza and the vaccination rate (Slovakia 12%) could raise to a percentage comparable to that of the EU countries (France 30%, England 32%, the Netherlands 28% and Germany 26%).",,Lucia Masaryková;Tomás Balázi;Magdaléna Fulmeková;L'ubica Lehocká

The identification rate of viruses during exacerbations of asthma (10-30%) is much higher than the viral identification rate generally found during asymptomatic periods in asthmatics (3%). The mechanisms whereby upper respiratory viruses might induce or contribute to attacks of asthma are currently unknown: epithelial damage, increased cytokines releasability, mouth breathing.... Influenza vaccination is recommended in patients with chronic pulmonary diseases. However, bronchial hyperreactivity has been reported after influenza vaccination in asthmatics. Reactions to these vaccines may be due to non-immunogenic impurities, which are not present in the more recently developed subunit vaccines.

Due to the limited efficacy of vaccination, antiviral drugs constitute a complementary approach in the control and prevention of influenza infections and thus play an important role in the management of influenza outbreaks and pandemics. Currently, adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are the only two classes of anti-influenza agents approved for clinical use. However, the worldwide emergence and high prevalence of adamantane-resistant virus variants has discouraged the use of the former drugs. NAIs have proved to be very effective against influenza A and B viruses. Nevertheless, oseltamivir-resistant strains have also been reported quite frequently, as in the case of seasonal H1N1 viruses that circulated between 2007 and 2009. Indeed, the emergence of drug-resistant virus variants is always a matter of concern because it could significantly compromise the usefulness of such intervention.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20682805/,Comparative pathology of select agent influenza a virus infections,"Influenza A virus infections may spread rapidly in human populations and cause variable mortality. Two of these influenza viruses have been designated as select agents: 1918 H1N1 virus and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus. Knowledge of the pathology of these virus infections in humans, other naturally infected species, and experimental animals is important to understand the pathogenesis of influenza, to design appropriate models for evaluation of medical countermeasures, and to make correct diagnoses. The most important complication of influenza in humans is viral pneumonia, which often occurs with or is followed by bacterial pneumonia. Viremia and extrarespiratory disease are uncommon. HPAI viruses, including HPAI H5N1 virus, cause severe systemic disease in galliform species as well as in anseriform species and bird species of other orders. HPAI H5N1 virus infection also causes severe disease in humans and several species of carnivores. Experimental animals are used to model different aspects of influenza in humans, including uncomplicated influenza, pneumonia, and virus transmission. The most commonly used experimental animal species are laboratory mouse, domestic ferret, and cynomolgus macaque. Experimental influenza virus infections are performed in various other species, including domestic pig, guinea pig, and domestic cat.

In the United States of America from 20,000 to 40,000 people die due to influenza and its complications every year. Vaccination is the best way of protection against this disease and its serious complications. The clinical efficacy and economic benefits of influenza vaccination is well proved and substantiated. Each year the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), WHO, Atlanta, USA publishes recommendations for influenza vaccinations indicating which groups of people and patients should be vaccinated for clinical reasons and which of them--for epidemiological reasons. Depending on the country, vaccination policies for influenza vaccinations are different. In Poland vaccination against influenza is recommended for all groups mentioned in ACIP document. Nevertheless, there is no reimbursement system for influenza vaccinations in our country, even only for high-risk groups. Desite this, from year to year more and more people are getting immunized. National campaign carried out by the National Influenza Center, Warsaw resulted in over 200-fold increase of number of doses of influenza vaccines distributed in the epidemic season 2001/2002 when compared with the season 1992/93. This fact shows the importance and efficacy of educational activities together with scientific studies for positive changes in patients' and physicians' attitude to influenza vaccinations.",,Lidia B Brydak

Using an arithmetic decision tree-type model we took into account population characteristics, varying influenza attack rates, health care consumption according to the Dutch health care model and all-cause mortality. Actual direct medical cost estimates were based on the Dutch guidelines for pharmaco-economic evaluation. In the base-case scenario with no preventive measure available and an average influenza attack rate of 30%, 4,958,188 influenza infections, 1,552,687 GP consultations, 83,515 hospitalizations and 173,396 deaths will take place in The Netherlands.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19094996/,Avian flu pandemic: Can we prevent it?,"Outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in Southeast Asia, Europe and Africa have led to devastating consequences for poultry, and have resulted in numerous infections in humans. Although these infections from the animal reservoir continue to accumulate, the virus does not seem to spread extensively among humans. However, for example, a process of genetic reassortment could occur in a human who is co-infected with avian influenza A virus and a human strain of influenza A virus. The resulting new virus might then be able to easily infect humans and spread from human to human. Therefore, many experts expect the occurrence of a pandemic due to a mutant virus which can be easily transmitted among humans. Thus, currently, a major public health concern is the next influenza pandemic; yet it remains unclear how to control such a crisis. In this paper, we investigate relations between the evolution of virulence and an effectiveness of pandemic control measures after the emergence of mutant avian influenza; one is an elimination policy of infected birds with avian influenza and the other is a quarantine policy of infected humans with mutant avian influenza. We found that each of these prevention policies can be ineffective (i.e., increase human morbidity or mortality). Further, interestingly, the same intervention might, under the same conditions, increase human morbidity and decrease human mortality, or vice versa. Our practical findings are that the quarantine policy can effectively reduce both human morbidity and mortality but the elimination policy increases either human morbidity or mortality in a worst case situation.",,Shingo Iwami;Yasuhiro Takeuchi;Xianning Liu

The new strain, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, was resistant to amantadine and rimantadine, and the most frequently used antiviral was oseltamivir. Randomized studies were not performed comparing neuraminidase inhibitors with placebo. Nevertheless, experience from prospective and retrospective cohorts indicated that these drugs were useful for improving the prognosis of patients admitted to hospitals, especially for those with more severe disease. Treatment with oseltamivir was associated with a reduction in days of fever, length of hospital stay, use of mechanical ventilation and mortality. Treatment was more effective if it was begun within the first 48 h after the onset of symptoms, but it was also useful if begun later. A safe and effective vaccine to prevent disease from this new influenza strain was available in developed countries soon after the pandemic began; thus, the rate of adverse effects was comparable to that of seasonal influenza vaccines. The main barrier to its use was the concern of target populations about its necessity and safety. Therefore, the challenges for future pandemics will be to increase the population coverage of the vaccine in developed countries and to make it affordable for developing countries.",,Francisco López-Medrano;María Carmen Fariñas;Antonio Payeras;Jerónimo Pachón

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17638196/,Undernutrition can affect the invading microorganism,"Undernutrition or malnutrition adversely affects host defenses against many invading microorganisms, thereby increasing the severity of infection. Studies of RNA viruses (e.g., coxsackievirus B and influenzavirus) have shown that selenium or vitamin E deficiency in mice increases disease severity and results in stable genomic changes in the virus that increase virulence. Changes in H3N2 influenzavirus were predominantly in the ordinarily stable M1 matrix protein. Whether this represents selection of already-existing variants or direct effects on viral RNA is unclear. Related questions include whether undernutrition in persons who acquire infection with influenzavirus H5N1 could promote genomic changes during infection that result in greater virulence and higher case-fatality rates, and whether undernutrition could help create the multiple mutations needed to instigate human-to-human transmission. These possibilities emphasize the importance of alleviating world poverty and malnutrition.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9489237/,Structured epidemic models and the spread of influenza in the central Canadian subarctic,"Patterns of transmission of infectious diseases within and among populations are strongly affected by population structure, which can either facilitate or limit interactions among people from different groups. Results from several theoretical studies show that nonrandom mixing among subgroups can affect the time when an infectious disease is introduced to the population, the speed of propagation of the disease, and the severity of an epidemic. Because many of these models focus on the effects of population structure, they are functionally similar to models used to describe the genetic structure of a population. One major difference between genetic models and epidemic models is that genetic models, with a time scale of the order of generations, incorporate migrations (or permanent movement) among subgroups, whereas epidemic models, with a time scale of the order of days or weeks, must incorporate short-term mobility among subgroups. Such mobility can be included in models for epidemic spread by explicitly incorporating the process by which residents from different locations interact with one another. We present a derivation of a mobility model for epidemic processes and apply it to the spread of the 1918-1919 influenza epidemic among the Cree and Métis people associated with three Hudson's Bay Company posts in the central Canadian Subarctic. The model distinguishes mobility from population effects. Results indicate that social organization (population effects) and social responses to the epidemic were more important than movement patterns (mobility) in explaining the differential impact of this virgin soil epidemic on the three study communities.",,L Sattenspiel;D A Herring

It has been postulated that genetic host factors may have contributed to this high mortality. We identified 455 individuals who died of the Spanish flu in Iceland during a 6-week period during the winter of 1918, representing >92% of all fatal domestic cases mentioned by historical accounts. The highest case fatality proportion was 2.8%, and peak excess mortality was 162/100,000/week. Fatality proportions were highest among infants, young adults, and the elderly. A genealogical database was used to study relatedness and relative risk (RR) of the fatal influenza victims and relatives of their unaffected mates. The significance of these RR computations was assessed by drawing samples randomly from the genealogical database matched for age, sex, and geographical distribution. Familial aggregation of fatalities was seen, with RRs for death ranging from 3.75 for first-degree relatives (P < 0.0001) to 1.82 (P = 0.005), 1.12 (P = 0.252), and 1.47 (P = 0.0001) for second- to fourth-degree relatives of fatal influenza victims, respectively.

In this review, we contrast findings from epidemiological and molecular studies of influenza virus transmission at different spatial scales. We show that findings are broadly consistent in large-scale studies of inter-regional or inter-hemispheric spread in temperate regions, revealing intense epidemics associated with multiple viral introductions, followed by deep troughs driven by seasonal bottlenecks. However, aspects of the global transmission dynamics of influenza viruses are still debated, especially with respect to the existence of tropical source populations experiencing high levels of genetic diversity and the extent of prolonged viral persistence between epidemics. At the scale of a country or community, epidemiological studies have revealed spatially structured diffusion patterns in seasonal and pandemic outbreaks, which were not identified in molecular studies. We discuss the role of sampling issues in generating these conflicting results, and suggest strategies for future research that may help to fully integrate the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of influenza virus over space and time.",,Cécile Viboud;Martha I Nelson;Yi Tan;Edward C Holmes

The aim of this paper is to propose new mathematical models to study different dynamics of H1N1 influenza virus spread in selected regions around the world. Spatial and temporal elements are included in these models to reproduce the dynamics of AH1N1/09 virus. Different models are used since H1N1 influenza virus spread in regions with different contact structures are not the same. We rely on time series notifications of individuals to estimate some of the parameters of the models. We find that, in order to reproduce the time series data and the spread of the disease, it is convenient to suggest spatio-temporal models.

We undertook a systematic literature review of the duration of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus shedding to examine the effects of age, severity of illness and receipt of antiviral treatment. Studies were identified by searching the PubMed database using the keywords 'H1N1', 'pandemic', 'pandemics', 'shed' and 'shedding'. Any study of humans with an outcome measure of viral shedding was eligible for inclusion in the review. Comparisons by age, degree of severity and antiviral treatment were made with forest plots. The search returned 214 articles of which 22 were eligible for the review. Significant statistical heterogeneity between studies precluded meta-analysis. The mean duration of viral shedding generally increased with severity of clinical presentation, but we found no evidence of longer shedding duration of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 among children compared with adults. Shorter viral shedding duration was observed when oseltamivir treatment was administered within 48 hours of illness onset. Considerable differences in the design and analysis of viral shedding studies limit their comparison and highlight the need for a standardised approach. These insights have implications not only for pandemic planning, but also for informing responses and study of seasonal influenza now that the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus has become established as the seasonal H1N1 influenza virus.","adult; antiviral agents; child; influenza A virus, H1N1 subtype; influenza, human; virus shedding.",James E Fielding;Heath A Kelly;Geoffry N Mercer;Kathryn Glass
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19344730/,A comparative evaluation of modelling strategies for the effect of treatment and host interactions on the spread of drug resistance,"The evolutionary responses of infectious pathogens often have ruinous consequences for the control of disease spread in the population. Drug resistance is a well-documented instance that is generally driven by the selective pressure of drugs on both the replication of the pathogen within hosts and its transmission between hosts. Management of drug resistance therefore requires the development of treatment strategies that can impede the emergence and spread of resistance in the population. This study evaluates various treatment strategies for influenza infection as a case study by comparing the long-term epidemiological outcomes predicted by deterministic and stochastic versions of a homogeneously mixing (mean-field) model and those predicted by a heterogeneous model that incorporates spatial pair-wise correlation. We discuss the importance of three major parameters in our evaluation: the basic reproduction number, the population level of treatment, and the degree of clustering as a key parameter determining the structure of heterogeneous interactions. The results show that, as a common feature in all models, high treatment levels during the early stages of disease outset can result in large resistant outbreaks, with the possibility of a second wave of infection appearing in the pair-approximation model. Our simulations demonstrate that, if the basic reproduction number exceeds a threshold value, the population-wide spread of the resistant pathogen emerges more rapidly in the pair-approximation model with significantly lower treatment levels than in the homogeneous models. We tested an antiviral strategy that delays the onset of aggressive treatment for a certain amount of time after the onset of the outbreak. The findings indicate that the overall disease incidence is reduced as the degree of clustering increases, and a longer delay should be considered for implementing the large-scale treatment.",,Murray E Alexander;Sarah M Dietrich;Yi Hua;Seyed M Moghadas

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17850689/,Modelling control measures to reduce the impact of pandemic influenza among schoolchildren,"We coupled the Wells-Riley equation and the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovery (SEIR) model to quantify the impact of the combination of indoor air-based control measures of enhanced ventilation and respiratory masking in containing pandemic influenza within an elementary school. We integrated indoor environmental factors of a real elementary school and aetiological characteristics of influenza to estimate the age-specific risk of infection (P) and basic reproduction number (R(0)). We combined the enhanced ventilation rates of 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2/h and respiratory masking with 60%, 70%, 80%, and 95% efficacies, respectively, to predict the reducing level of R0. We also took into account the critical vaccination coverage rate among schoolchildren. Age-specific P and R(0) were estimated respectively to be 0.29 and 16.90; 0.56 and 16.11; 0.59 and 12.88; 0.64 and 16.09; and 0.07 and 2.80 for five age groups 4-6, 7-8, 9-10, 11-12, and 25-45 years, indicating pre-schoolchildren have the highest transmission potential. We conclude that our integrated approach, employing the mechanism of transmission of indoor respiratory infection, population-dynamic transmission model, and the impact of infectious control programmes, is a powerful tool for risk profiling prediction of pandemic influenza among schoolchildren.",,S-C Chen;C-M Liao
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16861860/,Avian influenza: are our feathers ruffled?,"During the past century, three major influenza pandemics took place, leading to a devastating number of deaths. Pandemics occur through the emergence of a new strain of influenza virus that can infect humans, to which there is little pre-existing immunity and which spreads easily from human to human. The H5N1 influenza virus has the potential of becoming a pandemic virus, since it can infect humans and is highly pathogenic. All that remains is the final step of acquiring the genetic material to enable efficient human-to-human transmission. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared pandemic alert phase 3, the last phase before there is actual evidence of increased and efficient human-to-human transmission. In addition, every case of transmission of an avian influenza virus to humans is regarded by WHO as a cause for heightened alertness and surveillance. The circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in large numbers among the poultry population in a growing number of countries is a major concern. Since the influenza viruses are highly unstable, the co-circulation of highly pathogenic animal viruses with human viruses may create opportunities for different species-specific viruses to exchange genetic material, giving rise to a new influenza virus to which humans would have little, if any, protective immunity. In this article, we highlight the current avian influenza situation from its different aspects with a special focus on the Hajj since we host over 2 million pilgrims a year in the holy cities of Mekkah and Medina.",,Hanan Balkhy;Sami Al-Hajjar

No side effects of the 100-mg dose were observed in the amantadine-treated volunteers. Compared with placebo, 100 mg of amantadine significantly reduced the frequency of illness (9 of 22 versus 2 of 22 volunteers, P less than 0.04) and provided 78% protection against influenza illness. The two ill volunteers in the amantadine group had rhinitis only, whereas most of the ill placebo controls developed both systemic and upper-respiratory-tract illness. Wild-type virus was recovered from 50% of the amantadine-treated volunteers, compared with 82% of the placebo controls. Of note, the infected amantadine recipients shed 100 times less virus and shed virus for half as many days as did the infected placebo recipients. Although amantadine restricted viral replication, it did not interfere with the development of an antibody response to influenza virus. These results indicate that in adults experimentally challenged with influenza wild-type virus, 100 mg of amantadine is effective both in the prevention of influenza illness and in the restriction of virus replication.",,S D Sears;M L Clements

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17266457/,Use of molecular assays for the diagnosis of influenza,"Respiratory infections are the third highest cause of death worldwide and influenza has the highest mortality rate among lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Diagnosis of LRTIs relies mostly on clinical symptoms and is not fully satisfactory. Influenza laboratory diagnosis improves the efficiency of prophylaxis or treatment of influenza by antiviral molecules and has a strong impact on the cost-effectiveness of curative treatment. Inappropriate treatment of patients may result in spreading of resistant strains. Molecular diagnostics play a central role in the surveillance and response of pandemic influenza due to highly pathogenic strains. Real-time assays can be used for diagnosis or surveillance purposes in humans and animals, and microarrays can be used to identify and monitor the spread of dangerous variants. Molecular assays are also useful to identify and distinguish influenza, other respiratory viruses and bacteria, although their cost-effectiveness must be proven on a large scale. As new antiviral options will be available to clinicians, a better treatment choice will benefit the patient and community. Recent progress in molecular techniques will be reviewed. Examples of real-time assays for the detection of influenza viruses, including the highly pathogenic influenza A strains H5N1 and H7N7, will be discussed. Promising new techniques that allow detailed genotyping of viruses or multiplex detection of several respiratory pathogens from a unique specimen will also be discussed.

The present study compares the risk of clinical attack (i.e. clinical attack rate) between one- and two-dose vaccination schemes. If the efficacies do not greatly vary between one- and two-dose schemes, one-dose vaccination may well be supported. Nevertheless, two-dose vaccination is shown to result in less morbidity if the vaccine efficacies are greatly diminished by reducing the dose. As long as the detailed efficacy estimates rest on theoretical assumptions, single-dose vaccination may only be sufficiently justified in a specific setting where the number of vaccines is extremely limited.",,H Nishiura;K Iwata

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1800412/,"Influenza: relation of mortality to morbidity parameters--Netherlands, 1970-1989","The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between the number of influenza-like illness (ILI), weekly registered by the general practitioners (sentinel stations), and the monthly overall influenza mortality in people over 60 years of age, provided by the Dutch Statistical Bureau during the period July 1970 to June 1989. The quantitative impact of influenza-morbidity is expressed by three summary parameters, calculated from the 52 (53) weekly ILI-figures per season-year, (i) their sum (i.e. global extent of an epidemic), (ii) their standard deviation, and (iii) their maximum (i.e. peak number of ILI during an epidemic). In the analysis influenza A subtype is also included. These four parameters are mutually compared with respect to their predictability for yearly total influenza mortality in the 19 season-years available. In most cases, the standard deviation and the peak number of ILI are more powerful for prediction of mortality, than the global extent of the epidemic. The peak number of ILI is of special interest. It is particularly useful for estimating the effect on current influenza mortality during an ongoing epidemic. From the model it is possible to calculate a threshold (of weekly ILI) beyond which mortality increases proportionately more than the number of illness episodes. By using the peak value of morbidity it is possible to calculate the minimal impact of epidemic mortality. This study indicates that the weekly number of influenza-like illnesses has a certain prognostic value for the real impact of influenza. An electronic surveillance system could detect immediately the threshold above which influenza mortality increases more than proportionally.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,M J Sprenger;P G Mulder;W E Beyer;N Masurel

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing oxidative stress play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of lung injuries induced by infection with IAVs, therefore suggesting that anti-oxidative therapeutics targeting cellular molecules could be beneficial against IAV infection without inducing drug-resistant IAV strains. We recently found that the normal cellular prion protein, PrPC, whose conformational conversion into the amyloidogenic isoform, PrPSc, in the brain is a key pathogenic event in prion diseases, is expressed by lung epithelial cells and exerts a protective role against IAV infection in mice by reducing ROS in infected lungs. The Cu content and activity of anti- oxidative enzyme Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, or SOD1, were lower in the lungs of PrPC-knockout mice, suggesting that the anti-oxidative activity of PrPC is probably attributable to its function of activating SOD1 through regulating Cu content in lungs. Here, we introduce PrPC as a novel modulator of influenza and its potential implication for anti-oxidative therapies for IAV infection. We also introduce other candidate targets reported for anti- oxidative anti-influenza therapies.",,Suehiro Sakaguchi;Junji Chida

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7171231/,Problems in the control of epidemic influenza by vaccination,"Although influenza is a long established and well recognised disease with a known aetiological agent its control by vaccine has proved to be extremely difficult. This is largely the result of the unusual ability of influenza virus to change antigenically thereby avoiding neutralisation by antibody already produced by previous infection. The changes may be of a major nature, with the appearance of a new sub-type to which no one has any immunity; or of a minor nature, during the prevalence of a sub-type, but great enough to allow the virus to overcome waning immunity. Much effort has gone into the preparation of both killed and live attenuated vaccines. The killed vaccines are most widely available and are made from whole virus, disrupted virus or purified viral subunits. Live attenuated vaccines still have some disadvantages and their use is still restricted. A regular policy of immunisation of the general population has rarely been adopted for the prevention of spread of the disease, and the use of vaccine is usually directed towards protecting those people who are likely to become seriously ill or die. Influenza is particularly dangerous where there is pre-existing respiratory or cardiac disease, but the main mortality from influenza is among the elderly. Besides these target groups, vaccine can be effectively used for modifying the attack rates in close communities such as schools and military groups. In the event of pandemic influenza vaccines need to be applied to other target groups besides those above mentioned with the aim of preventing disruption of the social organisation when large numbers of the working population are ill at the same time.",,M S Pereira

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25274250/,Assessing the use of antiviral treatment to control influenza,"Vaccines are the cornerstone of influenza control policy, but can suffer from several drawbacks. Seasonal influenza vaccines are prone to production problems and low efficacies, while pandemic vaccines are unlikely to be available in time to slow a rapidly spreading global outbreak. Antiviral therapy was found to be beneficial during the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic even with limited use; however, antiviral use has decreased further since then. We sought to determine the role antiviral therapy can play in pandemic and seasonal influenza control using conservative estimates of antiviral efficacy, and to assess if conservative but targeted strategies could be employed to optimize the use of antivirals. Using an age-structured contact network model for an urban population, we compared the transmission-blocking ability of a conservative antiviral therapy strategy to the susceptibility-reducing effects of a robust influenza vaccine. Our results show that while antiviral therapy cannot replace a robust influenza vaccine, it can play a role in reducing attack rates and eliminating outbreaks, and could significantly reduce public health burden when vaccine is either unavailable or ineffective. We also found that antiviral therapy, by treating those who are infected, is naturally a highly optimized strategy, and need not be improved upon with expensive targeted campaigns.",influenza vaccines.,S C Kramer;S Bansal

Previously thought to infect only wild birds and poultry, H5N1 has now infected humans, cats, pigs and other mammals in an ongoing outbreak, often with a fatal outcome. In order to evaluate the risk factors for human infection with influenza virus H5N1, here we summarize 53 case patients confirmed with H5N1 infection during 2006. The review also compares the mortality rate among human cases from late 2003 until 15 June 2006 in different countries. Neither how these viruses are transmitted to humans nor the most effective way to reduce the risk for infection is fully understood. The association between household contact with diseased poultry in human infection has been demonstrated. This association could possibly operate by 2 mechanisms. First, transmission may be by inhalation or conjunctival deposition of large infectious droplets which may travel only in short distances. Second, having infected poultry in the home and preparation of infected poultry for consumption may result in exposure to higher virus concentrations than other types of exposure. There is so far no significant evidence for repeated human to human transmission, yet some cases of human to human transmission among the family relatives in Indonesia, Azerbaijan, Iraq and Turkey have been described. Recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (H5N1 subtype) infections in poultry and humans (through direct contact with infected birds) have raised concerns that a new influenza pandemic might occur in the near future.",,Muhammed Babakir-Mina;Emanuela Balestra;Carlo Federico Perno;Stefano Aquaro

A recent reanalysis of laboratory experiments indicates that absolute humidity strongly modulates the airborne survival and transmission of the influenza virus. Here, we extend these findings to the human population level, showing that the onset of increased wintertime influenza-related mortality in the United States is associated with anomalously low absolute humidity levels during the prior weeks. We then use an epidemiological model, in which observed absolute humidity conditions temper influenza transmission rates, to successfully simulate the seasonal cycle of observed influenza-related mortality. The model results indicate that direct modulation of influenza transmissibility by absolute humidity alone is sufficient to produce this observed seasonality. These findings provide epidemiological support for the hypothesis that absolute humidity drives seasonal variations of influenza transmission in temperate regions.",,Jeffrey Shaman;Virginia E Pitzer;Cécile Viboud;Bryan T Grenfell;Marc Lipsitch

Despite the tabloids’ portrayal of an imminent threat, to date there have been relatively few cases in humans in spite of large numbers of infected poultry (Hien et al. 2004). However, this may be falsely reassuring. Most indications suggest that it is just a matter of time until the next influenza pandemic occurs (Osterholm 2005). In the words of the UK Chief Medical Officer: “most experts believe that it is not a question of whether there will be another severe influenza pandemic but when” (Department of Health 2005). Although experts are agreed that a future influenza pandemic is almost inevitable, its timing is unpredictable and it is uncertain whether the virus responsible will be H5N1 or another, novel, influenza strain (Osterholm 2005). A recent editorial described avian influenza as a “predicament of extraordinary proportions” (Anonymous 2006).

Though the risk of community-level spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) remains to be low since the transmission of influenza virus from animals to humans is not common, HPAI may acquire changes in receptor-binding specificity that lead to human to human transmission. Cases of sporadic infection in humans have been increasing every year and the continuous spread has posed a threat to animal and human health. Vaccination remains to be the most effective strategy to prevent and control the spread of influenza viruses.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23231621/,Selecting nonpharmaceutical interventions for influenza,"Models of influenza transmission have focused on the ability of vaccination, antiviral therapy, and social distancing strategies to mitigate epidemics. Influenza transmission, however, may also be interrupted by hygiene interventions such as frequent hand washing and wearing masks or respirators. We apply a model of influenza disease transmission that incorporates hygiene and social distancing interventions. The model describes population mixing as a Poisson process, and the probability of infection upon contact between an infectious and susceptible person is parameterized by p. While social distancing interventions modify contact rates in the population, hygiene interventions modify p. Public health decision making involves tradeoffs, and we introduce an objective function that considers the direct costs of interventions and new infections to determine the optimum intervention type (social distancing versus hygiene intervention) and population compliance for epidemic mitigation. Significant simplifications have been made in these models. However, we demonstrate that the method is feasible, provides plausible results, and is sensitive to the selection of model parameters. Specifically, we show that the optimum combination of nonpharmaceutical interventions depends upon the probability of infection, intervention compliance, and duration of infectiousness.

Reasons for lowering the recommended age for routine vaccination from 65 years to 50 years include reductions in office visits, hospitalizations, time taken off work, and costs.

Because several months are needed to mass-produce vaccines once a new pandemic strain has been identified, antiviral drugs are often considered the first line of defense in a pandemic situation. Here we use an SIR disease model with periodic transmission rate to assess the efficacy of control strategies via antiviral drug treatment during an outbreak of pandemic influenza. We show that in some situations, and independent of drug-resistance effects, antiviral treatment can have a detrimental impact on the final size of the pandemic. Antiviral treatment also has the potential to increase the size of the major peak of the pandemic, and cause it to occur earlier than it would have if treatment were not used. Our studies suggest that when a disease exhibits periodic patterns in transmission, decisions of public health policy will be particularly important as to how control measures such as drug treatment should be implemented, and to what end (i.e.; towards immediate control of a current epidemic peak, or towards potential delay and/or reduction of an anticipated autumn peak).",,S Towers;K Vogt Geisse;Y Zheng;Z Feng

Eight children aged between 10 months and 7 years had neurological complications due to pandemic influenza (H1N1) and five of them were female. Four of them were previously healthy; there was chronic renal failure (CRF) in one and neurologic disease in three patients. Seven of them had seizure and altered consciousness. Seven of them were followed in pediatric intensive care units. We performed lumbar puncture in four patients and their cerebrospinal fluid examinations showed pleocytosis in one and no cell in three specimens.

There were 74 (75.5%) patients with suspected influenza A (H1N1) 2009, 10 (10.2%) with the likelihood and 14 (14.3%) with the confirmed influenza. In all the patients we registered the basic demographic data, risk factors for severe disease, symptoms and signs of influenza, laboratory tests and chest radiography.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19787654/,Surveillance and control of zoonotic agents prior to disease detection in humans,"The majority of newly emerging diseases are zoonoses caused by pathogens transmitted directly or indirectly through arthropod vectors to humans. Transmission chains leading to human infection frequently involve intermediate vertebrate hosts, including wildlife and domestic animals. Animal-based surveillance of domestic and wild animals for zoonotic pathogens is a global challenge. Until recently, there has been no scientific, social, or political consensus that animal-based surveillance for zoonotic pathogens merits significant infrastructural investment, other than the fledgling efforts with avian influenza. National institutions charged with strategic planning for emerging diseases or intentional releases of zoonotic agents emphasize improving diagnostic capabilities for detecting human infections, modifying the immune status of human or domestic animals through vaccines, producing better antiviral or antibacterial drugs, and enhancing human-based surveillance as an early warning system. With the exception of human vaccination, these anthropocentric approaches target post-spillover events, and none of these avenues of research will reduce the risk of additional emergences of pathogens from wildlife. Novel schemes for preventing spillover of human pathogens from animal reservoir hosts can spring only from an understanding of the ecological context and biological interactions that result in zoonotic disease emergence. Although the benefits derived from investments to improve surveillance and knowledge of zoonotic pathogens circulating among wildlife reservoir populations are uncertain, our experience with human immunodeficiency virus and the pandemic influenza inform us of the outcomes that we can expect by relying on detection of post-spillover events among sentinel humans.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4540995/,"Antigenic relationships between type a influenza viruses of human, porcine, equine, and avian origin","This paper summarizes the available information on the relationship of two envelope antigens (haemagglutinin and neuraminidase) of influenzaviruses isolated from different hosts. The relationship of the haemagglutinin antigens was based on the results of haemagglutination inhibition tests with postinfection sera and that of the neuraminidase antigens on the results of neuraminidase inhibition and gel precipitation tests with hyperimmune and monospecific sera. On the basis of the antigenic specificity of the haemagglutinin, the influenzaviruses of human origin are divided into several subtypes (H0, H1, H2); viruses of equine origin could be divided into two subtypes (Heq1, Heq2). Porcine influenza strains are regarded as belonging to a single subtype, all of them being related to the prototype swine influenzavirus A (swine/Iowa/15/30). Within the avian influenzaviruses, 6 antigenic subtypes were described in earlier studies. Antigenic relationships between the haemagglutinin of strains from different hosts were infrequent but were demonstrated and confirmed between human A/Hong Kong/68 and equine viruses and between A/Hong Kong/68 and swine/Taiwan/69. The swine/Taiwan/69 virus also shared the related neuraminidase with A/Hong Kong/68 virus, and represents the only isolation from nonhuman sources of an influenzavirus identical with a human pandemic strain. The studies on the antigenic specificity of the neuraminidases demonstrated 8 antigenic varieties of neuraminidase among avian influenzaviruses and also that the neuraminidase grouping did not correspond with the antigenic grouping with regard to haemagglutinin. The relationships between human and nonhuman influenzaviruses are emphasized because of their significance to studies on the origin of influenza pandemics in man.",,B Tumová;G C Schild

Exuberant immune responses induced following infection have been described as a ""cytokine storm,"" associated with excessive levels of proinflammatory cytokines and widespread tissue damage. Recent studies have painted a more complex picture of cytokine networks and their contributions to clinical outcomes. While many cytokines clearly inflict immunopathology, others have non-pathological delimited roles in sending alarm signals, facilitating viral clearance, and promoting tissue repair, such as the IL-33-amphiregulin axis, which plays a key role in resolving some types of lung damage. Recent literature suggests that type 2 cytokines, traditionally thought of as not involved in anti-influenza immunity, may play an important regulatory role. Here, we discuss the diverse roles played by cytokines after influenza infection and highlight new, serene features of the cytokine storm, while highlighting the specific functions of relevant cytokines that perform unique immune functions and may have applications for influenza therapy.",,Xi-Zhi J Guo;Paul G Thomas

The pandemic influenza A H1N1 2009 virus (A/2009/H1N1) finally arrived, causing the first pandemic influenza of the new millennium, which has affected over 214 countries and caused over 18,449 deaths. Because of the persistent threat from the A/H5N1 virus since 1997 and the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2003, medical and scientific communities have been more prepared in mindset and infrastructure. This preparedness has allowed for rapid and effective research on the epidemiological, clinical, pathological, immunological, virological, and other basic scientific aspects of the disease, with impacts on its control. A PubMed search using the keywords ""pandemic influenza virus H1N1 2009"" yielded over 2,500 publications, which markedly exceeded the number published on previous pandemics. Only representative works with relevance to clinical microbiology and infectious diseases are reviewed in this article.

We describe the epidemiology of the influenza pandemic in Wales between April and December 2009 using integrated data from a number of independent sources: GP surveillance, community virology surveillance, hospital admissions and deaths, and media enquiries monitoring. The first wave peaked in late July at 100 consultations per 100,000 general practice population and attracted intensive media coverage. The positivity rate for the A(H1N1)2009 influenza did not exceed 25% and only 44 hospitalisations and one death were recorded. By contrast, the second wave peaked in late October and although characterised by lower ILI consultation rates (65 consultations per 100,000 general practice population) and low profile media activity, was associated with much higher positivity rates for pandemic influenza A(H1N1)2009 (60%) and substantially more hospital admissions (n=379) and deaths (n=26). The large number of ILI-related consultations during the first wave in Wales probably reflected the intensive media activity rather than influenza virus circulating in the community. Data from community surveillance schemes may therefore have considerably overestimated the true incidence of influenza. This has implications for the future interpretation of ILI surveillance data and their use in policy making, and underlines the importance of using integrated epidemiological, virological and hospital surveillance data to monitor influenza activity.",,M Keramarou;S Cottrell;M R Evans;C Moore;R E Stiff;C Elliott;D R Thomas;M Lyons;R L Salmon

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20856792/,Social network sensors for early detection of contagious outbreaks,"Current methods for the detection of contagious outbreaks give contemporaneous information about the course of an epidemic at best. It is known that individuals near the center of a social network are likely to be infected sooner during the course of an outbreak, on average, than those at the periphery. Unfortunately, mapping a whole network to identify central individuals who might be monitored for infection is typically very difficult. We propose an alternative strategy that does not require ascertainment of global network structure, namely, simply monitoring the friends of randomly selected individuals. Such individuals are known to be more central. To evaluate whether such a friend group could indeed provide early detection, we studied a flu outbreak at Harvard College in late 2009. We followed 744 students who were either members of a group of randomly chosen individuals or a group of their friends. Based on clinical diagnoses, the progression of the epidemic in the friend group occurred 13.9 days (95% C.I. 9.9-16.6) in advance of the randomly chosen group (i.e., the population as a whole). The friend group also showed a significant lead time (p<0.05) on day 16 of the epidemic, a full 46 days before the peak in daily incidence in the population as a whole. This sensor method could provide significant additional time to react to epidemics in small or large populations under surveillance. The amount of lead time will depend on features of the outbreak and the network at hand. The method could in principle be generalized to other biological, psychological, informational, or behavioral contagions that spread in networks.",,Nicholas A Christakis;James H Fowler

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11194487/,[Influenza],"Influenza outbreaks remain today among the most serious and intractable health problems owing to high rates of morbidity and high economic costs. Periodical epidemics and pandemics in temperate regions of the world are due to high genetic variability of influenza viruses, which concerns primarily haemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens (antigenic drift and shift). Most influenza infections are self-limited, but they cause increased mortality in high-risk groups of population (such as the elderly and the subjects with chronic diseases) and increased morbidity in the general population, with loss of productivity and high health costs. During the past thirty years, efforts to control influenza have focused on the use of inactivated vaccines in high-risk groups and of two antiviral drugs, amantadine and rimantadine. However, the wide spread of influenza in all population groups and the limits of adamantane compounds induced to investigate novel approaches for prevention and control of flu. The new live attenuated, cold-adapted, trivalent intranasal vaccine was shown to be highly effective in children against influenza A (H3N2) and B viruses. The new antiviral drugs (zanamivir and oseltamivir), neuraminidase inhibitors, reduced the median time to alleviation of the major symptoms of influenza by 1-2 days. These advances in the last few years will certainly modify our approaches to influenza treatment and prevention.",,L Calza;E Briganti;R Manfredi;F Chiodo

The final size distributions for the number of household cases were extracted from four different data sources (n = 547, 671, 92 and 263 households), and a probability model was applied to estimate the community probability of infection (CPI) and household secondary attack rate (SAR). For the 1957 Asian influenza pandemic, the CPI and household SAR were estimated to be 0.42 [95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.37, 0.47] and 7.06% (95% CI: 4.73, 9.44), respectively, using data from Tokyo. The figures for the same pandemic using data from Osaka were 0.21 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.22) and 9.07% (95% CI: 6.73, 11.53), respectively.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12458359/,Conceptional considerations for a German influenza pandemic preparedness plan,"A pandemic appearance of influenza A virus must be expected at any time. The limitations of health preserving and life-saving resources, which will inevitably be reached in the event of a pandemic, will be accompanied by ethical and possibly social conflicts, which can be lessened or resolved only through precautionary planning, clearly specified competencies and transparent decisions within a social consensus. In case of a shortage of vaccines and virostatic agents, decisions will have to be made with regard to the segment of the population that absolutely must be vaccinated. It is currently estimated that a (monovalent) vaccine developed for a new pandemic strain would only suffice for the single vaccination of approximately half of the German population after a year; only 10-14 million vaccine dosages would be available to provide basic immunization and single boosters to personnel required to maintain basic medical care and essential infrastructure after half a year. In the event of local influenza outbreaks, antiviral chemotherapeutic agents could be used to close the gap until a vaccine can become effective. Even if suitable influenza vaccines and virostatic agents are not sufficiently available at the start of a pandemic, it is still possible to at least prevent an outbreak of two of the most feared secondary infections that accompany influenza: pneumococcal pneumonia or meningitis and illnesses resulting from Haemophilus influenzae. Agreement still needs to be reached with manufacturers for guaranteeing the necessary vaccine production or ensuring that they have a sufficient stock to meet the minimum demand for antiviral agents and agents for symptomatic treatment.",,R Fock;H Bergmann;H Bussmann;G Fell;E-J Finke;U Koch;M Niedrig;M Peters;D Scholz;A Wirtz

In order to evaluate and compare the impact of various vaccination strategies during a pandemic influenza, we developed an age/risk-structured model of influenza transmission, and parameterized it with epidemiological data from the 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic. Our model predicts that the impact of vaccination would be considerably diminished by delays in vaccination and staggered vaccine supply. Nonetheless, prioritizing limited H1N1 vaccine to individuals with a high risk of complications, followed by school-age children, and then preschool-age children, would minimize an overall attack rate as well as hospitalizations and deaths.

As is the case with pandemic influenza A, the majority of early deaths have been in young healthy adults. The complications of pandemic H1N1 have been reported from several centers. Noteworthy has been the relative rarity of bacterial coinfection in bacterial pneumonia in hospitalized adults with H1N1 pneumonia. Simultaneous bacterial community-acquired pneumonia due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus or community-acquired methicillin resistant S. aureus and subsequent bacterial community-acquired pneumonia due to S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae have been reportedly rare (0.4%-4% of well-documented cases). Cardiac complications of H1N1 infection have been uncommon. Young healthy adults without a cardiac history who have H1N1 and chest pain usually have either acute myocardial infarction or acute myocarditis. Cardiac symptomatology with H1N1 often overshadows pulmonary manifestations, that is, influenza pneumonia. With H1N1 pneumonia, clinicians should be alert for otherwise unexplained tachycardia or chest pain that may represent acute myocardial infarction or myocarditis. We present a case of rapidly fatal H1N1 in a young adult treated with oseltamivir and peramivir. He was initially tachycardic, thought to represent myocarditis.

In this review, we describe and compare the pathology of these viruses in human cases and animal models. The 1918 H1N1, the novel 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus, and H5N1 show inflammation, congestion, and epithelial necrosis of the larger airways (trachea, bronchi and bronchioles) with extension into the alveoli causing diffuse alveolar damage. Seasonal influenza A viruses (H3N2 and H1N1) have primarily caused inflammation, congestion and epithelial necrosis of the larger airways with lesser extension of the inflammatory process to alveoli. Localization of the inflammation and cellular damage relate to the presence of virus in different cell types. Infections with 1918 H1N1, the novel 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus, and H5N1 show virus in mucosal epithelial cells of the airways (from the nasopharynx to the bronchioles), alveolar macrophages, and pneumocytes, whereas infections with seasonal influenza viruses show viral antigens primarily in mucosal epithelial cells of the larger airways. The increased morbidity that has been encountered with the 2009 H1N1 virus is related to infection of cells in the upper and lower airways.

While the emergence of new strains and antigenic features is commonly attributed to selection by the human immune system, the mechanism that ensures the extinction of older strains remains controversial. To replicate this dynamics of replacement current models utilize mechanisms such as short-lived strain-transcending immunity, a direct competition for hosts, stochastic extinction or constrained antigenic evolution. Building on the idea of short-lived immunity we introduce a minimal model that exhibits the aforementioned dynamics of replacement. Our model relies only on competition due to an antigen specific immune-response in an unconstrained antigenic space.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6579922/,[Influenza],"Influenza is the last great uncontrolled plague of mankind. Pandemics and epidemics occur at regular time intervals. The influenza viruses are divided into the types A, B and C and show unique variability of their surface antigens (hemagglutinin and neuraminidase). Influenza viruses of type A show the largest degree of antigenic variation which, in turn, resulted in the definition of a number of subtypes, each comprising many strains. By comparison, influenza viruses of types B and C exhibit much less variation of their surface antigens. As a consequence, no subtypes but many different strains have been recognized. The degree of antigenic variation correlates with the epidemiologic significance of the virus types, type A being the most and type C the least important. Two different kinds of antigenic variation have been recognized: In the case of minor variation of one or both surface antigens, the term ""antigenic drift"" is employed. Antigenic drift occurs with all three types of virus, it is caused by point mutations which increase the chance of survival of mutants in the diseased host. In addition, influenza A viruses show sudden and complete changes of their surface antigens in regular time intervals, resulting in the appearance of new subtypes. This event is called ""antigenic shift"". The mechanisms responsible for antigenic shift are poorly understood, only. In addition to the recycling of preceding subtypes, reassortment resulting from double infection of cells with strains of human and animal origin are considered possible explanations. By use of modern DNA recombinant technology, the base sequences of a series of virus genes and, as a consequence, the amino acid sequence of the corresponding antigens have been determined. By means of monoclonal antibodies, the antigenic structure of many influenza antigens has been further elucidated. It can be expected that further research on the molecular basis of antigenic variation could finally result in an understanding of the causal mechanisms. It is an outstanding feature of the epidemiology of influenza A viruses that a family of related strains prevails for a certain period of time and disappears abruptly as a new subtype emerges.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,H J Drescher

An integral component of pandemic preparedness in many countries was the targeted use of antiviral therapy for containment, disease mitigation, and treatment. The 2009 pandemic marked the first pandemic during which influenza antivirals were available for global use. Although most national pandemic plans included provisions for antiviral treatment, these pre-determined protocols required frequent updating as more information became available about the virus, and its susceptibility to antiviral agents, the epidemiology of infection, and the population groups that were most susceptible to severe disease. National public health agencies in countries with both plans for use of antivirals and pre-existing stockpiles, including those in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, operated distinctly different antiviral distribution and treatment programs from one another. In the 3 years following the pandemic, there is still little comparison of the diversity of national antiviral treatment policies and drug distribution mechanisms that were implemented, whether they had any mitigating effects and which might be most efficient. The purpose of this study is to outline roles of antiviral medicines in a pandemic period, provide insights into the diversity of antiviral treatment and distribution policies applied by selected countries between April 2009-July 2010, and to stimulate discussion on whether these policies remain appropriate for implementation in future pandemics.",2009 Pandemic; antivirals; influenza.,Deeva Berera;Maria Zambon

The simulation period is separated into three consecutive periods based on the government's intervention strategies: the nonpharmaceutical strategy is used during Period 1. The nonpharmaceutical and antiviral strategies are executed during Period 2 and the vaccine strategy is added during Period 3. During Period 1, we estimate the reduction in the transmission rate due to the government's intervention policies as a difference between the data-fitted and uncontrolled transmission rate that is derived from the basic reproductive number, R0, of the model without intervention. This quantified reduced transmission rate is used as an upperbound of the nonpharmaceutical control for studying optimal control strategies, which is a new approach for determining the realistic upperbound of control. In this study, we also explore the real-time prediction of incidence using the mathematical model during the early stage of the epidemic.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24215382/,Adjunctive therapies and immunomodulating agents for severe influenza,"The value of adjunctive immunomodulatory therapies in treating severe influenza and other respiratory viral infections remains uncertain. Although often used, systemic corticosteroids may increase the risk of mortality and morbidity (e.g. secondary infections) in severe influenza and other viral infections, especially if there is delay or lack of effective antiviral therapy. Non-randomized studies suggest that convalescent plasma appears useful as add-on therapy for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza A(H5N1), and influenza A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic [A(H1N1)pdm09), but it is limited by its availability. A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing hyperimmune globulin prepared from convalescent plasma against normal intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIG) manufactured before 2009 as control in patients with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 infection on standard antiviral treatment has shown that the hyperimmune globulin group who received treatment within 5 days of symptom onset had a lower viral load and reduced mortality compared with the controls. A number of agents with immunomodulatory effects (e.g. acute use of statins, N-acetylcysteine, macrolides, PPAR agonists, IVIG, celecoxib, mesalazine) have been proposed for influenza management. However, more animal and detailed human observational studies and preferably RCTs controlling for the effects of antiviral therapy and disease severity are needed for evaluating these agents.

In contrast, influenza B viruses have been isolated only from man.The haemagglutinin of a virus isolated from gulls in the United States of America could not be identified with reference antisera and may constitute a new haemagglutinin subtype.Studies in swine suggest that H1N1 viruses related to A/New Jersey/8/76 continue to circulate in some countries of the world, and that the H3N2 and H1N1 viruses can be transmitted from man to pigs. The isolation from pigs of an H1N1 virus that is antigenically similar to avian H1N1 isolates and the isolation of ""classical"" swine influenza virus from a piglet in Czechoslovakia are of particular interest and raise the question of the source of the viruses.Preliminary studies on equine influenza viruses (H3N8) (Heq2Neq2) from horses in Europe suggest that significant antigenic drift has occurred in viruses of this subtype since the prototype was identified in 1963.The role of influenza viruses from lower animals and birds in the genesis of new human strains is unknown, and the genes responsible for host range and virulence have not yet been identified.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24710651/,An operational epidemiological model for calibrating agent-based simulations of pandemic influenza outbreaks,"Uncertainty of pandemic influenza viruses continue to cause major preparedness challenges for public health policymakers. Decisions to mitigate influenza outbreaks often involve tradeoff between the social costs of interventions (e.g., school closure) and the cost of uncontrolled spread of the virus. To achieve a balance, policymakers must assess the impact of mitigation strategies once an outbreak begins and the virus characteristics are known. Agent-based (AB) simulation is a useful tool for building highly granular disease spread models incorporating the epidemiological features of the virus as well as the demographic and social behavioral attributes of tens of millions of affected people. Such disease spread models provide excellent basis on which various mitigation strategies can be tested, before they are adopted and implemented by the policymakers. However, to serve as a testbed for the mitigation strategies, the AB simulation models must be operational. A critical requirement for operational AB models is that they are amenable for quick and simple calibration. The calibration process works as follows: the AB model accepts information available from the field and uses those to update its parameters such that some of its outputs in turn replicate the field data. In this paper, we present our epidemiological model based calibration methodology that has a low computational complexity and is easy to interpret. Our model accepts a field estimate of the basic reproduction number, and then uses it to update (calibrate) the infection probabilities in a way that its effect combined with the effects of the given virus epidemiology, demographics, and social behavior results in an infection pattern yielding a similar value of the basic reproduction number. We evaluate the accuracy of the calibration methodology by applying it for an AB simulation model mimicking a regional outbreak in the US. The calibrated model is shown to yield infection patterns closely replicating the input estimates of the basic reproduction number. The calibration method is also tested to replicate an initial infection incidence trend for a H1N1 outbreak like that of 2009.",Operational model calibration; Pandemic influenza model; Seasonal influenza model.,D Prieto;T K Das
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12160862/,Influenza virus still surprises,"Influenza virus remains a major public heath concern, both in its annual toll in death and debilitation and its potential to cause devastating pandemics. A number of recent surprising discoveries emphasize how little we know about influenza virus and its interaction with its hosts. These include the description of a novel viral protein encoded by an overlapping reading frame, the demonstration that the most abundant viral non-structural protein interferes with the induction of interferons by infected cells, and the finding that natural killer cells express activating receptors that detect viral cell-surface proteins. The introduction of improved methods for genetically manipulating influenza virus promises to revolutionize our understanding of viral replication and its interaction with the host innate and acquired immune systems, and will also enable the improvement of vaccines. Using knowledge of viral sequences recovered from archived or interred tissues from victims of the 1918 influenza pandemic, it is now possible to investigate why this virus was so pathogenic - it killed more than 20000000 people, most of whom were young adults in the prime of their lives.",,Jonathan Yewdell;Adolfo García-Sastre

The SIRC model predicts that the prevalence of a virus is maximum for an intermediate value of R(0), the basic reproduction number. Via a bifurcation analysis of the model, we discuss the effect of seasonality on the epidemiological regimes. For realistic parameter values, the model exhibits a rich variety of behaviors, including chaos and multi-stable periodic outbreaks. Comparison with empirical evidence shows that the simulated regimes are qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with reality, both for tropical and temperate countries. We find that the basins of attraction of coexisting cycles can be fractal sets, thus predictability can in some cases become problematic even theoretically.

These plans describe many types of ACFs, but their function and roles are unclear and need to be carefully considered because of the limited resources available and the reduced treatment options likely to be provided in a pandemic. Federal and state pandemic plans and the medical literature were reviewed, and models for ACFs being considered were defined and categorized. Applicability of these models to an influenza pandemic was analyzed, and recommendations are offered for future ACF use. ACFs may be best suited to function as primary triage sites, providing limited supportive care, offering alternative isolation locations to influenza patients, and serving as recovery clinics to assist in expediting the discharge of patients from hospitals.",,Clarence Lam;Richard Waldhorn;Eric Toner;Thomas V Inglesby;Tara O'Toole

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22784620/,Leveraging social networks for understanding the evolution of epidemics,Background: To understand how infectious agents disseminate throughout a population it is essential to capture the social model in a realistic manner. This paper presents a novel approach to modeling the propagation of the influenza virus throughout a realistic interconnection network based on actual individual interactions which we extract from online social networks. The advantage is that these networks can be extracted from existing sources which faithfully record interactions between people in their natural environment. We additionally allow modeling the characteristics of each individual as well as customizing his daily interaction patterns by making them time-dependent. Our purpose is to understand how the infection spreads depending on the structure of the contact network and the individuals who introduce the infection in the population. This would help public health authorities to respond more efficiently to epidemics.,,Gonzalo Martín;Maria-Cristina Marinescu;David E Singh;Jesús Carretero

Several national disaster plans, including that of Belgium, focus on maximal treatment at home with senior medical students supporting frontline care. To evaluate the knowledge and preparedness of Belgian senior medical students, an e-mail survey of senior medical students (last two years of education) attending Flemish universities was conducted. A total of 243 students (30%) replied. Only 21.8% of them were aware of the possibility of being involved in this planning. A total of 77.4% estimated H5N1 to be a possible threat to national health. Seventy percent of respondents reacted positively towards the idea of being involved in implementing primary care, and only 9.5% were absolutely opposed to the idea. A total of 82.3% would care for pandemic patients if necessary, but only 41.2% would do so if these patients were children. Only 18.9% estimated themselves to be sufficiently educated regarding H5N1. Ninety-one percent were convinced that care for H5N1-influenza patients should be incorporated into their regular curriculum. Several antiviral products were reported by the students to be efficient for treating H5N1, but only 34.6% correctly chose oseltamavir and/or zanamavir and 35.4% replied ""I don't know"".

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33064223/,Optimal Management of Public Perceptions During A Flu Outbreak: A Game-Theoretic Perspective,"Public perceptions and sentiments play a crucial role in the success of vaccine uptake in the community. While vaccines have proven to be the best preventive method to combat the flu, the attitude and knowledge about vaccines are a major hindrance to higher uptake in most of the countries. The yearly coverage, especially in the vulnerable groups in the population, often remains below the herd immunity level despite the Flu Awareness Campaign organized by WHO every year worldwide. This brings immense challenges to the nation's public health protection agency for strategic decision-making in controlling the flu outbreak every year. To understand the impact of public perceptions and vaccination decisions while designing optimal immunization policy, we model the individual decision-making as a two-strategy pairwise contest game, where pay-off is considered as a function of public health effort for the campaign. We use Pontryagin's maximum principle to identify the best possible strategy for public health to implement vaccination and reduce infection at a minimum cost. Our optimal analysis shows that the cost of public health initiatives is qualitatively and quantitatively different under different public perceptions and attitudes towards vaccinations. When individual risk perception evolves with vaccine uptake or disease induced death, our model demonstrates a feed-forward mechanism in the dynamics of vaccination and exhibits an increase in vaccine uptake. Using numerical simulation, we also observe that the optimal cost can be minimized by putting the effort in the beginning and later part of the outbreak rather than during the peak. It confers that public health efforts towards disseminating disease severity or actual vaccination risk might accelerate the vaccination coverage and mitigate the infection faster.",Evolutionary game theory; Free-riding behaviour; Herd immunity; Pontryagin’s maximum principle; SIR model; Vaccination.,Aniruddha Deka;Buddhi Pantha;Samit Bhattacharyya

The models are designed to test for possible differences between the seasonal transmission of influenza A and B. Model 1 assumes that the seasonality and magnitude of transmission do not vary between influenza A and B. Model 2 assumes that the magnitude of seasonal forcing (i.e., the maximum transmissibility), but not the background transmission or flu season length, differs between influenza A and B. Model 3 assumes that the magnitude of seasonal forcing, the background transmission, and flu season length all differ between strains. The models are all optimized using 10 years of surveillance data from 49 of 50 administrative divisions in Israel. Using a cross-validation technique, we compare the relative accuracy of the models and discuss the potential for prediction. We find that accounting for variation in transmission amplitude increases the predictive ability compared to the base. However, little improvement is obtained by allowing for further variation in the shape of the seasonal forcing function.",,Stefan Edlund;James Kaufman;Justin Lessler;Judith Douglas;Michal Bromberg;Zalman Kaufman;Ravit Bassal;Gabriel Chodick;Rachel Marom;Varda Shalev;Yossi Mesika;Roni Ram;Alex Leventhal

Tabulation of influenza-pneumonia deaths reflects more accurately the extent and impact of influenza but suffers from a 3-4 week-lag behind the actual clinical events. To improve influenza surveillance over the past 2 years, CDC obtained weekly numbers of emergency room visits to large community hospitals, school and industrial absenteeism, numbers of specimens submitted and numbers positive for influenza isolation from laboratories throughout the United States. Surveillance was most effective in large urban areas of the US where community hospital emergency rooms function as private physicians.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21886799/,Can interactions between timing of vaccine-altered influenza pandemic waves and seasonality in influenza complications lead to more severe outcomes?,"Vaccination can delay the peak of a pandemic influenza wave by reducing the number of individuals initially susceptible to influenza infection. Emerging evidence indicates that susceptibility to severe secondary bacterial infections following a primary influenza infection may vary seasonally, with peak susceptibility occurring in winter. Taken together, these two observations suggest that vaccinating to prevent a fall pandemic wave might delay it long enough to inadvertently increase influenza infections in winter, when primary influenza infection is more likely to cause severe outcomes. This could potentially cause a net increase in severe outcomes. Most pandemic models implicitly assume that the probability of severe outcomes does not vary seasonally and hence cannot capture this effect. Here we show that the probability of intensive care unit (ICU) admission per influenza infection in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic followed a seasonal pattern. We combine this with an influenza transmission model to investigate conditions under which a vaccination program could inadvertently shift influenza susceptibility to months where the risk of ICU admission due to influenza is higher. We find that vaccination in advance of a fall pandemic wave can actually increase the number of ICU admissions in situations where antigenic drift is sufficiently rapid or where importation of a cross-reactive strain is possible. Moreover, this effect is stronger for vaccination programs that prevent more primary influenza infections. Sensitivity analysis indicates several mechanisms that may cause this effect. We also find that the predicted number of ICU admissions changes dramatically depending on whether the probability of ICU admission varies seasonally, or whether it is held constant. These results suggest that pandemic planning should explore the potential interactions between seasonally varying susceptibility to severe influenza outcomes and the timing of vaccine-altered pandemic influenza waves.",,Utkarsh J Dang;Chris T Bauch

However, when humans are infected, a strong inflammatory response is usually induced, characterized by elevated levels of cytokines and chemokines in serum, believed to be important in the severe pathogenesis that develops in a high proportion of these patients. Extensive research has been performed to understand the molecular viral mechanisms involved in the H5N1 pathogenesis in humans, providing interesting insights about the virus-host interaction and the regulation of the innate immune response by these highly pathogenic viruses.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22939311/,The impact of personal experiences with infection and vaccination on behaviour-incidence dynamics of seasonal influenza,"Personal experiences with past infection events, or perceived vaccine failures and complications, are known to drive vaccine uptake. We coupled a model of individual vaccinating decisions, influenced by these drivers, with a contact network model of influenza transmission dynamics. The impact of non-influenzal influenza-like illness (niILI) on decision-making was also incorporated: it was possible for individuals to mistake niILI for true influenza. Our objectives were to (1) evaluate the impact of personal experiences on vaccine coverage; (2) understand the impact of niILI on behaviour-incidence dynamics; (3) determine which factors influence vaccine coverage stability; and (4) determine whether vaccination strategies can become correlated on the network in the absence of social influence. We found that certain aspects of personal experience can significantly impact behaviour-incidence dynamics. For instance, longer term memory for past events had a strong stabilising effect on vaccine coverage dynamics, although it could either increase or decrease average vaccine coverage depending on whether memory of past infections or past vaccine failures dominated. When vaccine immunity wanes slowly, vaccine coverage is low and stable, and infection incidence is also very low, unless the effects of niILI are ignored. Strategy correlations can occur in the absence of imitation, on account of the neighbour-neighbour transmission of infection and history-dependent decision making. Finally, niILI weakens the behaviour-incidence coupling and therefore tends to stabilise dynamics, as well as breaking up strategy correlations. Behavioural feedbacks, and the quality of self-diagnosis of niILI, may need to be considered in future programs adopting ""universal"" flu vaccines conferring long-term immunity. Public health interventions that focus on reminding individuals about their previous influenza infections, as well as communicating facts about vaccine efficacy and the difference between influenza and niILI, may be an effective way to increase vaccine coverage and prevent unexpected drops in coverage.",,C R Wells;C T Bauch

PLoS Med. 6(12), e1000182 (2009). The African continent is burdened with a very heavy load of communicable diseases over and above other severe health problems. Not surprisingly, influenza has received relatively little attention on the continent even though it is, in its own right, a major cause of morbidity and mortality--to a much greater extent than in the developed world owing to the aggravating prevalence of underlying diseases. The paucity of laboratory support can be a serious drawback in the clinical management of patients. For example, cases of febrile illnesses are frequently erroneously treated as malaria. In addition, this deficiency of laboratory capacity is a serious gap in the overall global surveillance of influenza and, indeed, of new emerging infections in general. Influenza has been one of the most rigorously studied of all human viruses, having been isolated three-quarters of a century ago and intensively investigated since then. Much is known about its molecular biology, but its epidemiological behavior and its unpredictability still remain public-health problems to this day. Furthermore, while most literature on influenza has been published from developed countries of the world, where the winter season plays a pivotal role in its epidemiology, by contrast, relatively little is known about influenza behavior in tropical countries and even less in the African continent.

A mutation characterized by the substitution of aspartic acid (wild-type) to glycine at position 222 within the haemagglutinin gene (HA-D222G) was recorded during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Germany and other countries with significant frequency in fatal and severe cases. Additionally, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses exhibiting the polymorphism HA-222D/G/N were detected both in the respiratory tract and in blood. Specimens from mild, fatal and severe cases were collected to study the heterogeneity of HA-222 in A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulating in Germany between 2009 and 2011. In order to enable rapid and large scale analysis we designed a pyrosequencing (PSQ) assay. In 2009/2010, the 222D wild-type of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominated in fatal and severe outcomes. Moreover, co-circulating virus mutants exhibiting a D222G or D222E substitution (8/6%) as well as HA-222 quasispecies were identified (10%). Both the 222D/G and the 222D/G/N/V/Y polymorphisms were confirmed by TA cloning. PSQ analyses of viruses associated with mild outcomes revealed mainly the wild-type 222D and no D222G change in both seasons. However, an increase of variants with 222D/G polymorphism (60%) was characteristic for A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses causing fatal and severe cases in the season 2010/2011. Pure 222G viruses were not observed. Our results support the hypothesis that the D222G change may result from adaptation of viral receptor specificity to the lower respiratory tract. This could explain why transmission of the 222G variant is less frequent among humans. Thus, amino acid changes at HA position 222 may be the result of viral intra-host evolution leading to the generation of variants with an altered viral tropism.",,Marianne Wedde;Stephanie Wählisch;Thorsten Wolff;Brunhilde Schweiger
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33522695/,Influenza and Influenza Vaccine: A Review,"Influenza is a highly contagious, deadly virus, killing nearly half a million people yearly worldwide. The classic symptoms of influenza are fever, fatigue, cough, and body aches. In the outpatient setting, diagnosis can be made by clinical presentation with optional confirmatory diagnostic testing. Antiviral medications should be initiated as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours of initiation of symptoms. The primary preventive measure against influenza is vaccination, which is recommended for all people 6 months of age or older, including pregnant and postpartum women, unless the individual has a contraindication. Vaccination should occur at the beginning of flu season, which typically begins in October. It takes approximately 14 days after vaccination for a healthy adult to reach peak antibody protection. There are challenges associated with vaccine composition and vaccine uptake. It takes approximately 6 to 8 months to identify and predict which influenza strains to include in the upcoming season's vaccine. During this time, the influenza virus may undergo antigenic drift, that is, mutating to avoid a host immune response. Antigenic drift makes the vaccine less effective in some seasons. The influenza virus occasionally undergoes antigenic shift, in which it changes to a novel virus, creating potential for a pandemic. There are also barriers to vaccine uptake, including lack of or limited access to care and misconceptions about receiving the vaccine. Interventions that improve access to and uptake of the influenza vaccine must be initiated, targeting multiple levels, including health care policy, patients, health care systems, and the health care team.

Children with H1N1 infection had undergone kidney transplantation more recently than their uninfected counterparts. The most common symptoms included fever (92.9%), cough (85.7%), headache (42.9%), and vomiting (42.9%). Fifty percent of patients required hospitalization, of median duration 3.0 (1.0-5.0) days. No child required intensive care treatment. Half the H1N1-infected children had acute renal dysfunction, with serum creatinine elevated >10% above basal values (median increase 21.6 [14.3-46.2]%). In five of the seven children, serum creatinine returned to baseline within two wk. These findings indicate that H1N1 influenza infection in pediatric kidney transplant recipients followed at our center was surprisingly mild, and produced no lasting sequelae.",,Michelle L Frieling;Angela Williams;Turki Al Shareef;Gunjeet Kala;Jun Chuan Teh;Valerie Langlois;Upton D Allen;Diane Hebert;Lisa A Robinson
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19887149/,Transmission and control of an emerging influenza pandemic in a small-world airline network,"The avian influenza virus H5N1 and the 2009 swine flu H1N1 are potentially serious pandemic threats to human health, and air travel readily facilitates the spread of infectious diseases. However, past studies have not yet incorporated the effects of air travel on the transmission of influenza in the construction of mathematical epidemic models. Therefore, this paper focused on the human-to-human transmission of influenza, and investigated the effects of air travel activities on an influenza pandemic in a small-world network. These activities of air travel include passengers' consolidation, conveyance and distribution in airports and flights. Dynamic transmission models were developed to assess the expected burdens of the pandemic, with and without control measures. This study also investigated how the small-world properties of an air transportation network facilitate the spread of influenza around the globe. The results show that, as soon as the influenza is spread to the top 50 global airports, the transmission is greatly accelerated. Under the constraint of limited resources, a strategy that first applies control measures to the top 50 airports after day 13 and then soon afterwards to all other airports may result in remarkable containment effectiveness. As the infectiousness of the disease increases, it will expand the scale of the pandemic, and move the start time of the pandemic ahead.",,Chaug-Ing Hsu;Hsien-Hung Shih

Eight immunocompromised patients with documented novel influenza A (H1N1) had CT imaging at our institution between May 2009 and August 2009. A total of 20 CTs (initial and follow-up) were reviewed for the presence, severity, and distribution of the following: ground glass opacity, consolidation, interlobular septal thickening, mosaic perfusion, airway wall thickening, airway dilatation, nodules, cysts, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, lymphadenopathy, and air trapping. The most common findings were airway thickening/dilatation, peribronchial ground glass opacity, centrilobular nodules, and tree-in-bud opacities. Peripheral consolidation involving the lower lobes was also a common pattern. Findings frequently involved all lobes and were closely associated with either large or small airways. Two patients presented with atypical CT findings including focal lobar consolidation and patchy lower lobe consolidation with soft tissue centrilobular nodules. Most survivors showed near complete resolution of findings within 35 days. CT scans in immunocompromised patients with novel influenza H1N1 commonly show a strong airway predominance of findings or peripheral areas of consolidation involving the lower lobes.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29530388/,A review of the 1918 herald pandemic wave: importance for contemporary pandemic response strategies,"Mounting epidemiological evidence supports the occurrence of a mild herald pandemic wave in the spring and summer of 1918 in North America and Europe, several months before the devastating autumn outbreak that killed an estimated 2% of the global population. These epidemiological findings corroborate the anecdotal observations of contemporary clinicians who reported widespread influenza outbreaks in spring and summer 1918, with sporadic occurrence of unusually severe clinical manifestations in young adults. Initially seen as controversial, these findings were eventually confirmed by retrospective identification of influenza specimens collected from U.S. soldiers who died from acute respiratory infections in May-August 1918. Other studies found that having an episode of influenza illness during the spring herald wave was highly protective in the severe autumn wave. Here, we conduct a systematic review of the clinical, epidemiological, and virological evidence supporting the global occurrence of mild herald waves of the 1918 pandemic and place these historic observations in the context of pandemic preparedness. Taken together, historic experience with the 1918 and subsequent pandemics shows that increased severity in second and later pandemic waves may be the rule rather than the exception. Thus, a sustained pandemic response in the first years following a future pandemic is critical; conversely, multiwave pandemic patterns allow for more time to rollout vaccines and antivirals.",1918 pandemic; Age patterns; Excess mortality; Herald wave; Influenza; Pandemic preparedness; Severity; Transmissibility.,Lone Simonsen;Gerardo Chowell;Viggo Andreasen;Robert Gaffey;John Barry;Don Olson;Cécile Viboud

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12781742/,Traveling waves in a model of influenza A drift,"Between major pandemics, the influenza A virus changes its antigenic properties by accumulating point mutations (drift) mainly in the RNA genes that code for the surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The successful strain (variant) that will cause the next epidemic is selected from a reduced number of progenies that possess relatively high transmissibility and the ability to escape from the immune surveillance of the host. In this paper, we analyse a one-dimensional model of influenza A drift (Z. Angew. Math. Mech. 76 (2) (1996) 421) that generalizes the classical SIR model by including mutation as a diffusion process in a phenotype space of variants. The model exhibits traveling wave solutions with an asymptotic wave speed that matches well those obtained from numerical simulations. As exact solutions for these waves are not available, asymptotic estimates for the amplitudes of infected and recovered classes are provided through an exponential approximation based on the smallness of the diffusion constant. Through this approximation, we find simple scaling properties to several parameters of relevance to the epidemiology of the disease.",,Juan Lin;Viggo Andreasen;Renato Casagrandi;Simon A Levin

A randomised controlled trial,"The aim of this study was to determine the cost effectiveness of influenza vaccination for healthy people aged 65-74 years living in the UK. People without risk factors for influenza (chronic heart, lung or renal disease, diabetic, immunosuppressed or those living in an institution) were identified from 20 general practitioner (GP) practices in Liverpool in September 1999. 729/5875 (12.4%) eligible individuals were recruited and randomised to receive either influenza vaccine or placebo (ratio 3:1), with all participants receiving 23-valent-pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine unless already administered. The primary analysis was the frequency of influenza as recorded by a GP diagnosis of pneumonia or influenza like illness. In 2000, the UK vaccination policy was changed with influenza vaccine becoming available for all people aged 65 years and over irrespective of risk. As a consequence of this policy change, the study had to be fundamentally restructured and only results obtained over a one rather than the originally planned two-year randomised controlled trial framework were used. Results from 1999/2000 demonstrated no significant difference between groups for the primary outcome (relative risk 0.8, 95% CI 0.16-4.1). In addition, there were no deaths or hospitalisations for influenza associated respiratory illness in either group. The subsequent analysis, using both national and local sources of evidence, estimated the following cost effectiveness indicators: (1) incremental NHS cost per GP consultation avoided = 2000 pound sterling; (2) incremental NHS cost per hospital admission avoided = 61,000 pound sterling; (3) incremental NHS cost per death avoided = 1,900,000 pound sterling and (4) incremental NHS cost per QALY gained = 304,000 pound sterling.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11779394/,Influenza diagnosis and treatment: a view from clinical practice,"Influenza is a descriptive term for respiratory epidemic disease presenting with cough and fever. Influenza viruses are probably the most important of the pathogens that cause this condition. Clinical influenza occurs almost every winter in England and Wales and the outbreaks last 8-10 weeks. In recent years, influenza B virus outbreaks have occurred in January and February, whereas influenza H3N2 virus outbreaks have generally started long before Christmas. Influenza H3N2 virus outbreaks pressurize health service resources in winter more than influenza B viruses, that do not have the same impact in elderly people. Infections with influenza H1N1 viruses are also usually less severe in their impact than those with influenza H3N2 viruses, but, unlike influenza B viruses, influenza H1N1 viruses have a pandemic potential along with influenza H3N2 viruses. A diagnosis of respiratory infection in primary care is based on the presenting symptoms set within the context of the current pattern of consultations of patients with similar illness. Measurement of temperature, inspection of the throat and examination of the chest or ears add a little to the diagnostic process, but in general these procedures do not help in identifying the organism. However, if it is known that influenza viruses are circulating in the community, the probability of influenza as the cause is greatly increased, as was shown in clinical trials of neuraminidase antivirals. Maximum confusion occurs when respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza cocirculate. Although RSV infection can occur throughout the winter in young children, it assumes more of an epidemic character just before Christmas in children and possibly in adults just after. During seven of the last 20 winters, influenza has been prevalent around Christmas/New Year. In routine virological surveillance of influenza-like illness in the community during the winters of 1997, 1998 and 1999, ca. 30% of swab specimens yielded influenza viruses and 20% RSV. Given the limitations for routine surveillance, including variations in the interval between illness onset and specimen capture, the quality of swab, delays in transport, the growth properties of virus culture methods, etc., these figures probably underestimate the impact of both viruses in the community. The impact of influenza is considered against the background of total respiratory infections presenting to general practitioners over the last 10 years and some comparisons are made with the 1969 pandemic experience. Lessons relevant to pandemic planning are drawn. Current options for investigation and treatment are compared with those available in 1969. These include near-patient tests for assisting with diagnosis, widespread use of vaccination as a preventive in patients at increased risk, the availability of amantadine and the newer neuraminidase inhibitor antivirals and changes in the delivery of health care. Major advances in the understanding of influenza and improvements in investigation and treatment have taken place over the last 30 years.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26206138/,Induction of innate immunity and its perturbation by influenza viruses,"Influenza A viruses (IAV) are highly contagious pathogens causing dreadful losses to human and animal, around the globe. IAVs first interact with the host through epithelial cells, and the viral RNA containing a 5'-triphosphate group is thought to be the critical trigger for activation of effective innate immunity via pattern recognition receptors-dependent signaling pathways. These induced immune responses establish the antiviral state of the host for effective suppression of viral replication and enhancing viral clearance. However, IAVs have evolved a variety of mechanisms by which they can invade host cells, circumvent the host immune responses, and use the machineries of host cells to synthesize and transport their own components, which help them to establish a successful infection and replication. In this review, we will highlight the molecular mechanisms of how IAV infection stimulates the host innate immune system and strategies by which IAV evades host responses.",immune escape; influenza A virus; innate immunity.,Mohsan Ullah Goraya;Song Wang;Muhammad Munir;Ji-Long Chen

However, some experimental and clinical studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of acute lung injury in influenza virus infections is associated with excessive host response including a cell-mediated immune reaction. During the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza A virus infections in Korea, we experienced a dramatic effect of immune-modulators (corticosteroids) on the patients with severe pneumonia who had significant respiratory distress at presentation and those who showed rapidly progressive pneumonia during oseltamivir treatment. We also found that the pneumonia patients treated with corticosteroids showed the lowest lymphocyte differential and that the severity of pneumonia was associated with the lymphocyte count at presentation. From our findings and previous experimental and clinical studies, we postulated that hyperactive immune cells (T cells) may be involved in the acute lung injury of influenza virus infections, using a hypothesis of 'protein homeostasis system'; the inducers of the cell-mediated immune response are initially produced at the primary immune sites by the innate immune system. These substances reach the lung cells, the main target organ, via the systemic circulation, and possibly the cells of other organs, including myocytes or central nerve system cells, leading to extrapulmonary symptoms (e.g., myalgia and rhabdomyolysis, and encephalopathy). To control these substances that may be possibly toxic to host cells, the adaptive immune reaction may be operated by immune cells, mainly lymphocytes. Hyperimmune reaction of immune cells produces higher levels of cytokines which may be associated with acute lung injury, and may be controlled by early use of immune-modulators. Early initiation and proper dosage of immune-modulators with antiviral agents for severe pneumonia patients may reduce morbidity and prevent progressive fatal pneumonia.",,Kyung-Yil Lee;Jung-Woo Rhim;Jin-Han Kang
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10728134/,Viral pneumonias. Epidemic respiratory viruses,"Influenza, respiratory syncytial, and parainfluenza viruses usually cause mild, self-limited illness in adults. However, elderly and immunocompromised persons are at increased risk for development of severe pneumonia. Clinical and radiographic features of epidemic viral pneumonias are often nonspecific. Newer and faster methods of viral culture and viral antigen detection have improved the capability for definitive diagnosis in recent years. Preventive measures for influenza virus pneumonia center on limiting exposure of high-risk patients to active cases of influenza, administering annual vaccinations, and providing chemoprophylaxis. Prophylaxis against RSV is effective in preventing complications. No effective vaccines have been developed against RSV or parainfluenza. Therapy for viral pneumonia is primarily supportive. Amantadine may be beneficial for influenza virus pneumonia, and ribavirin may be useful for RSV and parainfluenza virus disease. However, further definitive studies are necessary to determine their roles in these viral pneumonias.",,J W Chien;J L Johnson

The Egyptian context--analysis of the Egyptian health policy for the H1N1 flu pandemic control,"A new influenza virus that was first detected in people in April 2009, was initially referred to colloquially as ""swine flu"", since it contained genes from swine, avian and human influenza viruses. It can, however, not be transmitted by eating pork or dealing with pigs. In Egypt, several hundred thousand pigs were killed in May, in spite of advice from global health authorities that such an action was unnecessary. Pigs are raised and consumed mainly by the Christian minority, which constitute some 10% of the population. Health Ministry estimated there were between 300,000-350,000 pigs in Egypt. This paper will analyze the Egyptian health policy for controlling the pandemic H1N1 flu, exploring its context, content, process, and actors. The analysis is based on the Leichter Context, which refers to systemic factors-political, economic and social, both national and international-that may have an effect on health policy, and is based on data collected from literature review and policy documents. The International health officials said the swine flu virus that has caused worldwide fear is not transmitted by pigs, and that pig slaughters do nothing to stop its spread. The WHO stopped using the term ""swine flu"" to avoid confusion. In Egypt, even the editor of a pro-government newspaper criticized the order to slaughter: ""Killing (pigs) is not a solution, otherwise, we should kill the people, because the virus spreads through them,"" wrote Abdullah Kamal of the daily Rose El-Youssef. The World Health organization also criticized the decision. The extinction of the Egyptian pigs is an example of how a health issue can be used to persecute a minority within a country. Although the current influenza has nothing whatsoever to do with pigs, the previous name of the epidemic was used as an argument to violate the rights of the Christian minority in Egypt.",Egypt; Swine; corruption; epidemics; flu; health; influenza; minority; policy.,Sameh Seef;Anders Jeppsson
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20022969/,Clinical management of pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) infection,"Antiviral therapy and vaccination are important strategies for controlling pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) but efficacy depends on the timing of administration and is often limited by supply shortage. Patients with dyspnea, tachypnea, evidence of hypoxemia, and pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph should be hospitalized. Patients with severe illness or underlying medical conditions that increase the risk of more severe disease should be treated with oseltamivir or zanamivir as soon as possible, without waiting for the results of laboratory tests. Lung-protective ventilation strategy with a low tidal volume and adequate pressure, in addition to a conservative fluid management approach, is recommended when treating adult patients with ARDS. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has emerged as an important rescue therapy for critically ill patients. Use of systemic steroids was associated with delayed viral clearance in severe acute respiratory syndrome and H3N2 infection. Low-dose corticosteroids may be considered in the treatment of refractory septic shock. Passive immunotherapy in the form of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune globulin may be explored as rescue therapy. More data are needed to explore the potential role of IV gamma globulin and other drugs with immunomodulating properties, such as statins, gemfibrozil, and N-acetyl-cysteine. Health-care workers must apply strict standard and droplet precautions when dealing with suspected and confirmed case and upgrade to airborne precautions when performing aerosol-generating procedures.

We recommend a triple vaccination in cancer patients (seasonal influenza, S-OIV, streptococus pneumoniae), if possible at least two weeks before beginning chemotherapy. In case of an influenza-like illness under chemotherapy, the care will depend on the neutrophilic level. If neutrophil count is under 500 units/mm3, hospital admission is recommended with adapted isolation measures and the prescription of an antiviral treatment with oseltamivir 75 mg twice a day for 5 days, if the onset of symptoms occurred within 48 hours. In case of a sign of severity, antiviral treatment should be started regardless of time of the onset of symptoms. Probabilistic antibiotics should also be introduced. In the absence of neutropenia, home care should be favored, by explaining recommended hygienic measures and by starting an antiviral treatment with the same modalities as described previously.

Neuraminidase inhibition titres of some sera were high and the avidity of the inhibitor was comparable to that of specific antibody. The neuraminidase of A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3N2), which has undergone considerable antigenic drift in man since 1957, was inhibited to a lesser extent by the bird sera, while the neuraminidases of the A/BEL/42 (H0N1) and A/FM/1/47 (H1N1) strains were not inhibited at all. The inhibitor could be removed from the sera by adsorption with A/57 virus particles, but not by particles of A/BEL or A/FM1 viruses. These results suggested that the inhibitor in the bird sera was specific antibody. The antibodies to A/57 neuraminidase were found in sera from wedge-tailed shearwaters (Puffinus pacificus) and noddy terns (Anous minutus) nesting on islands off the north-east coast of Australia. They were not found in sera from bridled terns (Sterna anaetheta) or brown gannets (Sula leucogaster) nesting on the same islands.

Such human infections have been sporadic and are caused by H7N7 and H5N1 high-pathogenicity (HP) and H9N2 low-pathogenicity (LP) AI viruses in Europe and Asia. These infections have raised the level of concern by human health agencies for the potential reassortment of influenza virus genes and generation of the next human pandemic influenza A virus. The presence of endemic infections by H5N1 HPAI viruses in poultry in several Asian countries indicates that these viruses will continue to contaminate the environment and be an exposure risk with human transmission and infection. Furthermore, the reports of mammalian infections with H5N1 AI viruses and, in particular, mammal-to-mammal transmission in humans and tigers are unprecedented. However, the subsequent risk for generating a pandemic human strain is unknown.

The productivity of translational research involving infectious diseases relevant to both human and animal health (e.g., influenza diagnosis and epidemiology using emerging molecular detection and identification methods) can be maximized when both human and veterinary medical virology disciplines are integrated. Influenza viruses are continually evolving through site-specific mutation and segment reassortment, and these processes occur in all potential carrier species - including birds, humans, and many agriculturally important animals. This evolutionary plasticity occasionally allows ""novel"" influenzas to move from animal hosts to humans, potentially causing destructive pandemics; therefore, a rapid laboratory technique that can detect and identify ""novel"" influenza viruses is clinically and epidemiologically desirable. A technique-focused translational research approach is pursued to enhance detection and characterization of emerging influenza viruses circulating in both humans and other animal hosts. The PLEX-ID System, which incorporates multi-locus PCR and electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry, uses deliberately nonspecific primers that amplify all known variants (all H/N subtypes) of influenza virus, including human, other mammalian, and avian influenzas, and is therefore likely to generate analyzable amplicons from any novel influenza that might emerge in any host.

Approximately three million free vaccine doses are ordered and administered to high-risk populations at the beginning of flu season to control the disease. The government recommends sharing and redistributing vaccine inventories when shortages occur. While this policy intends to increase inventory flexibility, and has been proven as widely valuable, its impact on vaccine availability has not been previously reported.",,Sheng-I Chen

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24267875/,Does homologous reinfection drive multiple-wave influenza outbreaks? Accounting for immunodynamics in epidemiological models,"Epidemiological models of influenza transmission usually assume that recovered individuals instantly develop a fully protective immunity against the infecting strain. However, recent studies have highlighted host heterogeneity in the development of this immune response, characterized by delay and even absence of protection, that could lead to homologous reinfection (HR). Here, we investigate how these immunological mechanisms at the individual level shape the epidemiological dynamics at the population level. In particular, because HR was observed during the successive waves of past pandemics, we assess its role in driving multiple-wave influenza outbreaks. We develop a novel mechanistic model accounting for host heterogeneity in the immune response. Immunological parameters are inferred by fitting our dynamical model to a two-wave influenza epidemic that occurred on the remote island of Tristan da Cunha (TdC) in 1971, and during which HR occurred in 92 of 284 islanders. We then explore the dynamics predicted by our model for various population settings. We find that our model can explain HR over both short (e.g. week) and long (e.g. month) time-scales, as reported during past pandemics. In particular, our results reveal that the HR wave on TdC was a natural consequence of the exceptional contact configuration and high susceptibility of this small and isolated community. By contrast, in larger, less mixed and partially protected populations, HR alone cannot generate multiple-wave outbreaks. However, in the latter case, we find that a significant proportion of infected hosts would remain unprotected at the end of the pandemic season and should therefore benefit from vaccination. Crucially, we show that failing to account for these unprotected individuals can lead to large underestimation of the magnitude of the first post-pandemic season. These results are relevant in the context of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza post-pandemic era.",Influenza; Mechanistic modelling; Multiple-wave outbreak; Pandemic; Primary immune response; Reinfection.,A Camacho;B Cazelles

The aim of this study was to evaluate the consistency of sentinel general practitioners' swabbing practice within and between influenza seasons. Aggregated, weekly, non-identified data for May to October each year from 2007 to 2014 were used to calculate the proportion of patients presenting with ILI (defined as cough, fever and fatigue), proportion of ILI patients swabbed and proportion of swabs positive for influenza. Data on the proportion of consultations for ILI and the proportion of ILI patients swabbed were aggregated into time-period quintiles for each year. Analysis of variance was used to compare ILI patients swabbed for each aggregated time-period quintile over all 8 years. Spearman's correlation and Bland-Altman analyses were used to measure association and agreement respectively between ILI proportions of consultations and swabs positive for influenza in time period quintiles within each year. Data were aggregated by year for the rest of the analyses. Between 2007 and 2014 there was a slight decrease in the proportion of positive tests and the proportion of ILI patients was generally a good proxy for influenza test positivity. There was consistency in testing within and between seasons, despite an overall testing increase between 2007 and 2014. There was no evidence for temporal sampling bias in these data despite testing not being performed on a systematic basis.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22311680/,Neuraminidase inhibitor resistance in influenza viruses and laboratory testing methods,"Infection with influenza viruses, including seasonal, avian and pandemic viruses, remains a worldwide public health problem. Although influenza virus infection is both vaccine preventable and drug treatable, high rates of mutation and reassortment of viruses can result in reduced effectiveness of vaccines or drugs. Currently, two classes of drugs, adamantanes (M2 blockers) and neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (NAIs), are available for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza infections. Given these limited antiviral therapy options, resistance to anti-influenza drugs is a constant concern. The emergence and global spread of adamantane-resistant H3N2 viruses in 2003-2004 and oseltamivir-resistant seasonal H1N1 viruses in 2007-2009 demonstrated the ability of drug-resistant variants to rapidly become predominant worldwide. Since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, all influenza viruses circulating in humans are M2-blocker-resistant and, in general, NAI-susceptible. However, pandemic H1N1 viruses with resistance to the NAI oseltamivir have been reported. 'Permissive' drift mutations and reassortment of viral gene segments have been proposed as mechanisms underlying the retained replicative fitness of resistant viruses. Nevertheless, the precise role of these genetic changes in the efficient transmission and maintenance of resistant viruses in the absence of drug pressure remains poorly understood. In this review, we summarize NAI resistance in influenza viruses and discuss recent challenges in laboratory testing methods. Close monitoring of antiviral resistance among all influenza viruses, both locally and globally, are essential to inform public health strategies for the control of influenza infections.",,Ha T Nguyen;Alicia M Fry;Larisa V Gubareva
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23376579/,The importance of contact network topology for the success of vaccination strategies,"The effects of a number of vaccination strategies on the spread of an SIR type disease are numerically investigated for several common network topologies including random, scale-free, small world, and meta-random networks. These strategies, namely, prioritized, random, follow links and contact tracing, are compared across networks using extensive simulations with disease parameters relevant for viruses such as pandemic influenza H1N1/09. Two scenarios for a network SIR model are considered. First, a model with a given transmission rate is studied. Second, a model with a given initial growth rate is considered, because the initial growth rate is commonly used to impute the transmission rate from incidence curves and to predict the course of an epidemic. Since a vaccine may not be readily available for a new virus, the case of a delay in the start of vaccination is also considered in addition to the case of no delay. It is found that network topology can have a larger impact on the spread of the disease than the choice of vaccination strategy. Simulations also show that the network structure has a large effect on both the course of an epidemic and the determination of the transmission rate from the initial growth rate. The effect of delay in the vaccination start time varies tremendously with network topology. Results show that, without the knowledge of network topology, predictions on the peak and the final size of an epidemic cannot be made solely based on the initial exponential growth rate or transmission rate. This demonstrates the importance of understanding the topology of realistic contact networks when evaluating vaccination strategies.",,Junling Ma;P van den Driessche;Frederick H Willeboordse

However, it remains poorly understood as to why some infected individuals succumb to life threatening complications whilst others recover and are relatively unaffected. Using gene-expression analysis of circulating leukocytes, here we show that the progression towards severe influenza A infection is characterised by an abnormal transcriptional reprogramming of cell cycle and apoptosis pathways. In severely infected humans, leukocyte gene-expression profiles display opposing cell cycle activities; an increased aberrant DNA replication in the G(1)/S phase yet delayed progression in the G(2)/M phase. In mild infection, cell cycle perturbations are fewer and are integrated with an efficient apoptotic program. Importantly, the loss of integration between cell cycle perturbations and apoptosis marks the transition from a mild viral illness to a severe, life threatening infection. Our findings suggest that circulating immune cells may play a significant role in the evolution of the host response.

Virus transmission characteristics will not be completely known in advance, but difficulties in influenza control typically include peak infectivity early in illness, a short interval between cases, and to a lesser extent, transmission from persons with incubating or asymptomatic infection. Screening and quarantining entering travelers at international borders did not substantially delay virus introduction in past pandemics, except in some island countries, and will likely be even less effective in the modern era. Instead, WHO recommends providing information to international travelers and possibly screening travelers departing countries with transmissible human infection. The principal focus of interventions against pandemic influenza spread should be at national and community levels rather than international borders.",,World Health Organization Writing Group;David Bell;Angus Nicoll;Keiji Fukuda;Peter Horby;Arnold Monto;Frederick Hayden;Clare Wylks;Lance Sanders;Jonathan Van Tam
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2391423/,Tumor necrosis factor-alpha production of influenza A virus-infected macrophages and potentiating effect of lipopolysaccharides,"Influenza A virus infections are commonly associated with symptoms that suggest involvement of TNF-alpha. In this study, we exposed human monocytes, rat alveolar macrophages, and murine PU5-1.8 macrophages to influenza A virus, strain Puerto Rico 8. We observed a productive infection that was accompanied by TNF-alpha mRNA accumulation, TNF-alpha release and subsequent cell death. TNF-alpha production was dependent on exposure to live virus, in contrast to IFN release that was also induced by UV-inactivated virus. Most strikingly, low amounts of LPS (1 to 10 ng/ml) from Escherichia coli or Haemophilus influenzae were capable of strongly potentiating TNF-alpha production from virus-infected macrophages. The potentiating effect of LPS was neither due to increased survival of macrophages nor to altered virus multiplication, enhanced TNF-alpha gene expression, discharge of intracellular TNF-alpha stores, or shifts in the kinetics of TNF-alpha release. Thus, low amounts of LPS, which could easily be present in vivo, may serve as a potent trigger signal for TNF-alpha production from macrophages that have been primed by influenza A virus infection. These data suggest that the frequently observed serious complications of combined influenza A virus and bacterial infections may be partially due to a high TNF-alpha production.",,M Nain;F Hinder;J H Gong;A Schmidt;A Bender;H Sprenger;D Gemsa

We used a stochastic influenza simulation model for rural Southeast Asia to investigate the effectiveness of targeted antiviral prophylaxis, quarantine, and pre-vaccination in containing an emerging influenza strain at the source. If the basic reproductive number (R0) was below 1.60, our simulations showed that a prepared response with targeted antivirals would have a high probability of containing the disease. In that case, an antiviral agent stockpile on the order of 100,000 to 1 million courses for treatment and prophylaxis would be sufficient. If pre-vaccination occurred, then targeted antiviral prophylaxis could be effective for containing strains with an R0 as high as 2.1.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21922688/,Burden of the 1999-2008 seasonal influenza epidemics in Italy: comparison with the H1N1v (A/California/07/09) pandemic,"Despite preventive efforts, seasonal influenza epidemics are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality every year worldwide, including developed countries. The A/H1N1v pandemic imposed a considerable healthcare and economic burden. In order to obtain an accurate estimate of the economic burden of influenza, and hence to guide policymakers effectively, systematic studies are necessary. To this end, data from epidemiological surveillance are essential. To estimate the impact of the 1999-2008 seasonal influenza epidemics and the H1N1v pandemic, we analyzed data from the Italian Influenza Surveillance System (CIRI NET). In the period 1999-2008, the Italian surveillance network consisted of sentinel general practitioners and pediatricians, who reported cases of Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) and Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI ) observed during their clinical practice from mid-October to late April each year; reports were sent to the Center for Research on Influenza and other Viral Infections (CIRI -IV). CIRI -IV receives data from 9 of the 20 Italian regions: Liguria, Abruzzo, Calabria, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Lombardy, Puglia, Sicily, Tuscany and Umbria. Previous estimates of influenza case costs were used in economic evaluations. Clinical-epidemiological and virological surveillance of the seasonal epidemics from 1999-2008 showed that the highest epidemic period was 2004-2005, when a new variant of the H3N2 influenza virus subtype emerged (A/California/07/04). Indeed, the highest peak of morbidity in the decade occurred in February 2005 (12.6 per 1,000 inhabitants). In 1999-2008, H1N1 subtype strains circulated and co-circulated with strains belonging to the H3N2 subtype and B type. Regarding B viruses in 2001-02, viruses belonged to the B/Victoria/02/07 lineage re-emerged, and in subsequent years co-circulated with viruses belonging to the B/Yamagata/lineage. The estimated costs of seasonal epidemics from 1999-2008 in Italy ranged from €15 to €20 billion, and the costs of the H1N1v pandemic ranged from €1.3 to €2.3 billion. This Italian study yields interesting conclusions: the results of influenza surveillance in several developed countries vary markedly; influenza imposes a considerable social, healthcare and economic burden; most cases that occurred during the pandemic involved subjects under 14 years of age and, although the clinical course of H1N1v influenza was usually mild, the related economic burden was heavy.",,Piero Luigi Lai;Donatella Panatto;Filippo Ansaldi;Paola Canepa;Daniela Amicizia;Antonio Giuseppe Patria;Roberto Gasparini
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25347806/,Optimal control of vaccination dynamics during an influenza epidemic,"For emerging diseases like pandemic influenza, several factors could impact the outcome of vaccination programs, including a delay in vaccine availability, imperfect vaccine-induced protection, and inadequate number of vaccines to sufficiently lower the susceptibility of the population by raising the level of herd immunity. We sought to investigate the effect of these factors in determining optimal vaccination strategies during an emerging influenza infection for which the population is entirely susceptible. We developed a population dynamical model of disease transmission and vaccination, and analyzed the control problem associated with an adaptive time-dependent vaccination strategy, in which the rate of vaccine distribution is optimally determined with time for minimizing the total number of infections (i.e., the epidemic final size). We simulated the model and compared the outcomes with a constant vaccination strategy in which the rate of vaccine distribution is time-independent. When vaccines are available at the onset of epidemic, our findings show that for a sufficiently high vaccine efficacy, the adaptive and constant vaccination strategies lead to comparable outcomes in terms of the epidemic final size. However, the adaptive vaccination requires a vaccine coverage higher than (or equivalent to) the constant vaccination regardless of the rate of vaccine distribution, suggesting that the latter is a more cost-effective strategy. When the vaccine efficacy is below a certain threshold, the adaptive vaccination could substantially outperform the constant vaccination, and the impact of adaptive strategy becomes more pronounced as the rate of vaccine distribution increases. We observed similar results when vaccines become available with a delay during the epidemic; however, the adaptive strategy may require a significantly higher vaccine coverage to outperform the constant vaccination strategy. The findings indicate that the vaccine efficacy is a key parameter that affects optimal control of vaccination dynamics during an epidemic, raising an important question on the trade-off between effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of vaccination policies in the context of limited vaccine quantities.",,Majid Jaberi-Douraki;Seyed M Moghadas

In 1999, the Influenza Pandemic Planning Committee of the Communicable Diseases Network Australia New Zealand (CDNANZ) recommended that a national surveillance system be established comprising both community-based and institutional surveillance. In 2001, however, influenza surveillance remains fragmented in Australia and mainly restricted to major cities. Methods of surveillance and reporting of influenza activity vary between States and even within States. Three disparate case definitions are in use for reporting influenza-like illnesses. Many sentinel sites do not have laboratory support for confirmation of influenza or identification of circulating strains.

However, apart from characterization of viral binding sites in avian and mammalian hosts, relatively little investigation has focused on host genetic determinants of susceptibility or resistance to infection, or the severity of the associated disease in humans or other species. Similarly, the role of genetic background in the generation of an efficacious immune response to either infection or vaccination has not been extensively evaluated. However, genetic influences on susceptibility and resistance to numerous infectious agents and on the resultant host inflammatory and immune responses are well established in both humans and other animals. Mouse-adapted strains of human influenza viruses and the use of inbred strains of laboratory mice have supported extensive characterization of the pathogenesis and immunology of influenza virus infections. Like individual humans, inbred strains of mice vary in their reactions to influenza infection, particularly with regard to the inflammatory response and disease severity, supporting the potential use of these mice as a valuable surrogate for human genetic variation.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26453807/,The coexistence or replacement of two subtypes of influenza,"A pandemic subtype of influenza A sometimes replaces but sometimes coexists with the previous seasonal subtype. For example, the 1957 pandemic subtype H2N2 replaced the seasonal subtype H1N1; whereas after 1977 subtypes H1N1 (from the pandemic) and H3N2 continue to coexist. In an attempt to understand these alternatives, a hybrid model for the dynamics of influenza A is formulated. During an epidemic season the model takes into account cross-immunity of strains depending on the most recent seasonal infection. This cross-immunity reduces susceptibility to related strains of the seasonal subtype, and wanes with time due to virus drift. The population is assumed to reach an equilibrium distribution in susceptibility after several seasons, and then a pandemic subtype appears. Individuals who have been infected by the seasonal subtype all have the same cross-immunity to the pandemic subtype. A combination of theoretical and numerical analyses shows that for very strong cross-immunity between the subtypes the pandemic cannot invade, whereas for strong and weak cross-immunity there is coexistence for the season following the pandemic, and for intermediate levels of cross-immunity the pandemic may replace the seasonal subtype. This replacement depends on the basic reproduction numbers of seasonal and pandemic influenza. Vaccination against the seasonal subtype is found to slightly increase this range for pandemic replacement, with the range increasing with increasing vaccine protection and with the length of time that vaccine-induced immunity lasts.",Cross-immunity; Influenza drift; Influenza pandemic; Reproduction number; Vaccination.,Sarder Mohammed Asaduzzaman;Junling Ma;P van den Driessche

Large culture-proven outbreaks may occur despite high resident vaccination rates. There is, therefore, a significant role for concurrent administration of influenza vaccination and antiviral therapy. The use of antiviral treatment and chemoprophylaxis requires community reporting of viral isolates, and contingency plans for rapid case identification and application of antiviral therapy. Clinicians must react quickly to control a highly infectious seasonal pathogen that may strike as an explosive outbreak. This situation is unique in geriatric practice. Current antiviral treatment should be administered within 48 hours of symptom onset, and is more efficacious if administered within 12 hours. In the case of an explosive institutional outbreak, a 1-day delay in prophylaxis may allow infection of many residents with a potentially fatal illness. Influenza must be differentiated from other respiratory viruses or syndromes. Grouped rapid diagnostic tests can aid laboratory confirmation. Antiviral agents include the M(2) inhibitors, amantadine and rimantadine, active against influenza A, and the neuraminidase inhibitors, zanamivir and oseltamivir, active against influenza A and B. In our experience, influenza B illness is as severe as influenza A. All agents have similar efficacy as treatment and prophylaxis against sensitive strains. When M(2) inhibitors are used simultaneously within an enclosed space (i.e. household or nursing home) as both treatment and prophylaxis, resistant strains may emerge that limit prophylactic efficacy. When M(2) inhibitors are administered to suspected cases (residents or staff) in institutions, precautions against secretion are especially important to diminish the risk of transmission of resistant virus. Rimantadine has been shown to have significantly fewer CNS adverse events compared with amantadine. Amantadine and oseltamivir require dosage adjustment in those with renal impairment. Oseltamivir, rimantadine and amantadine are administered by mouth, while zanamivir is administered by oral inhalation in a lactose powder. The labelling advises caution in the use of zanamivir in those with underlying airway disease. Pooled analysis of studies in patients given zanamivir indicate that individuals over the age of 50 years (at high risk for complications) and those severely symptomatic at presentation, tend to benefit most from early treatment. Neuraminidase inhibitors also diminish the need for antibacterials to treat secondary complications. An institutional programme to control influenza should include vaccination, and contingency plans for clinical surveillance, specimen processing and the rapid application of antiviral treatment and prophylaxis.",,Paul J Drinka

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26150502/,Inferring influenza dynamics and control in households,"Household-based interventions are the mainstay of public health policy against epidemic respiratory pathogens when vaccination is not available. Although the efficacy of these interventions has traditionally been measured by their ability to reduce the proportion of household contacts who exhibit symptoms [household secondary attack rate (hSAR)], this metric is difficult to interpret and makes only partial use of data collected by modern field studies. Here, we use Bayesian transmission model inference to analyze jointly both symptom reporting and viral shedding data from a three-armed study of influenza interventions. The reduction in hazard of infection in the increased hand hygiene intervention arm was 37.0% [8.3%, 57.8%], whereas the equivalent reduction in the other intervention arm was 27.2% [-0.46%, 52.3%] (increased hand hygiene and face masks). By imputing the presence and timing of unobserved infection, we estimated that only 61.7% [43.1%, 76.9%] of infections met the case criteria and were thus detected by the study design. An assessment of interventions using inferred infections produced more intuitively consistent attack rates when households were stratified by the speed of intervention, compared with the crude hSAR. Compared with adults, children were 2.29 [1.66, 3.23] times as infectious and 3.36 [2.31, 4.82] times as susceptible. The mean generation time was 3.39 d [3.06, 3.70]. Laboratory confirmation of infections by RT-PCR was only able to detect 79.6% [76.5%, 83.0%] of symptomatic infections, even at the peak of shedding.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23733366/,A mathematical model of avian influenza with half-saturated incidence,"The widespread impact of avian influenza viruses not only poses risks to birds, but also to humans. The viruses spread from birds to humans and from human to human In addition, mutation in the primary strain will increase the infectiousness of avian influenza. We developed a mathematical model of avian influenza for both bird and human populations. The effect of half-saturated incidence on transmission dynamics of the disease is investigated. The half-saturation constants determine the levels at which birds and humans contract avian influenza. To prevent the spread of avian influenza, the associated half-saturation constants must be increased, especially the half-saturation constant H m for humans with mutant strain. The quantity H m plays an essential role in determining the basic reproduction number of this model. Furthermore, by decreasing the rate β m at which human-to-human mutant influenza is contracted, an outbreak can be controlled more effectively. To combat the outbreak, we propose both pharmaceutical (vaccination) and non-pharmaceutical (personal protection and isolation) control methods to reduce the transmission of avian influenza. Vaccination and personal protection will decrease β m, while isolation will increase H m. Numerical simulations demonstrate that all proposed control strategies will lead to disease eradication; however, if we only employ vaccination, it will require slightly longer to eradicate the disease than only applying non-pharmaceutical or a combination of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical control methods. In conclusion, it is important to adopt a combination of control methods to fight an avian influenza outbreak.",,Nyuk Sian Chong;Jean Michel Tchuenche;Robert J Smith
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11779397/,Developing vaccines against pandemic influenza,"Pandemic influenza presents special problems for vaccine development. There must be a balance between rapid availability of vaccine and the safeguards to ensure safety, quality and efficacy of vaccine. Vaccine was developed for the pandemics of 1957, 1968, 1977 and for the pandemic alert of 1976. This experience is compared with that gained in developing vaccines for a possible H5N1 pandemic in 1997-1998. Our ability to mass produce influenza vaccines against a pandemic threat was well illustrated by the production of over 150 million doses of 'swine flu' vaccine in the USA within a 3 month period in 1976. However, there is cause for concern that the lead time to begin vaccine production is likely to be about 7-8 months. Attempts to reduce this time should receive urgent attention. Immunogenicity of vaccines in pandemic situations is compared over the period 1968-1998. A consistent feature of the vaccine trials is the demonstration that one conventional 15 microg haemagglutinin dose of vaccine is not sufficiently immunogenic in naive individuals. Much larger doses or two lower doses are needed to induce satisfactory immunity. There is some evidence that whole-virus vaccines are more immunogenic than split or subunit vaccines, but this needs substantiating by further studies. H5 vaccines appeared to be particularly poor immunogens and there is evidence that an adjuvant may be needed. Prospects for improving the development of pandemic vaccines are discussed.",,J M Wood

For fixed levels of cross-protection, the chance that the second mutant establishes increases with rho the basic reproduction ratio and some temporary immunity may be necessary to explain the slenderness of flu's phylogenetic tree. In the presence of moderate levels of temporary immunity, an asymmetric situation can arise in the season after the two mutants were introduced and established: if the offspring of the new mutant arrives before the offspring of the resident type, then the mutant-line may produce a massive epidemic suppressing the original lineage.

For successful replication, influenza viruses have evolved as to counteract and/or take a part on host defense mechanisms. Manipulation of apoptosis is one of such mechanisms that have been subject of attention, particularly in relation to influenza type A viruses over the past years. However, this knowledge has not been extended to include influenza type B viruses. In this study, MDCK-SIAT1 cells were infected with influenza A and B strains and the kinetics and pathways of apoptosis post infection were studied, through LDH measurements, Hoechst dye staining, caspase activity assays and protein expression analysis. The resulting data points to a difference in induction of apoptosis profiles between influenza A and B strains. While influenza A strain induced apoptosis later in the course of infection and mainly by the intrinsic pathway, influenza B strain induced apoptosis early in infection by both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Also, data revealed the IκB/NF-κB pathway as the major contributor for the observed differences. The study of the virus-host interactions, particularly those that could have an impact on viral replication, are essential in both influenza A and B viruses, as they will allow the identification of viral/host targets common to both influenza types, which could affect viral replication.

A history of exposure to dead or sick poultry or wild birds occurs in over 60% of cases of human H5N1 infection. The incubation period of avian-to-human transmission is generally between 2 and 5 days and the median duration of symptoms before hospitalization is about 4.5 days. The clinical spectrum has ranged from asymptomatic infection or mild influenza-like illness to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure. Fever > 38 degrees C, cough and dyspnoea are the major symptoms on presentation, whereas gastrointestinal symptoms such as watery diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain are common early in the course of the disease. In contrast, upper respiratory tract symptoms are less prominent in human H5N1 infection when compared to seasonal influenza. Laboratory features of human H5N1 infection include leucopoenia, especially lymphopenia, elevated amino-transaminases, thrombocytopenia, prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, increased D-Dimer, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine phospho-kinase, and hypoalbuminemia.

Typically characterized by annual seasonal epidemics, sporadic pandemic outbreaks involve influenza A virus strains of zoonotic origin. The WHO estimates that annual epidemics of influenza result in ~1 billion infections, 3–5 million cases of severe illness and 300,000–500,000 deaths. The severity of pandemic influenza depends on multiple factors, including the virulence of the pandemic virus strain and the level of pre-existing immunity. The most severe influenza pandemic, in 1918, resulted in >40 million deaths worldwide. Influenza vaccines are formulated every year to match the circulating strains, as they evolve antigenically owing to antigenic drift. Nevertheless, vaccine efficacy is not optimal and is dramatically low in the case of an antigenic mismatch between the vaccine and the circulating virus strain. Antiviral agents that target the influenza virus enzyme neuraminidase have been developed for prophylaxis and therapy. However, the use of these antivirals is still limited. Emerging approaches to combat influenza include the development of universal influenza virus vaccines that provide protection against antigenically distant influenza viruses, but these vaccines need to be tested in clinical trials to ascertain their effectiveness.",,Florian Krammer;Gavin J D Smith;Ron A M Fouchier;Malik Peiris;Katherine Kedzierska;Peter C Doherty;Peter Palese;Megan L Shaw;John Treanor;Robert G Webster;Adolfo García-Sastre

As of yet, it is still unknown if, how and where further transmission within the Netherlands will take place. Therefore, intensified surveillance in the Netherlands is essential. Information on individual patients and their contacts is available through the compulsory notification of the new influenza. The number of general practitioners and nursing homes participating in surveillance through national networks is extended. In addition mortality statistics and internet-based surveillance are being used (the Dutch Great Influenza Survey). Based on studies on previous flu epidemics and mathematical models we can estimate the expected effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions.The reduction of social contacts, in particular through the closure of schools, hand washing routines and wearing of facemasks if done correctly, are expected to be effective non-pharmaceutical interventions in slowing the transmission of the new influenza virus.",,Marianne A B van der Sande;Wim van der Hoek;Mariëtte Hooiveld;Gé A Donker;Jim E van Steenbergen;Michiel van Boven;Jacco Wallinga

Of fourteen patients with type b H. influenzae infections treated with streptomycin alone ten recovered promptly; in three of the four remaining cases failure was proved to be due to emergence of resistance of the organisms to streptomycin. 2. The rapid development of resistance to 1000 units of streptomycin per cc. during treatment argues against metabolic adaptation of the bacteria. 3. Careful study of large samples of initial bacterial populations shows resistant members in all ten strains examined. The incidence varies from 1 in 1.1 billion to 1 in 13.8 billion organisms. 4. The proportion of resistant members is not significantly higher, before treatment, in patients who do poorly than in those who respond promptly. 5. The results indicate that emergence of resistance is the result of a selective process; after elimination of sensitive members the very few resistant ones, apparently present in all strains, make up most or all of the population in the cultures taken after commencement of treatment. 6. The survival of organisms which can grow in high concentrations of streptomycin, either in patients or in vitro, is influenced more by the size of the bacterial population than by any other known factor. 7. Since the bacterial population is relatively small in those patients with mild or moderately severe infections the likelihood of a significant number of very resistant members being present is remote. 8. The traits responsible for resistance of the organisms are apparently inherited: (a) The resistant state of one strain has been transmitted in vitro without change in degree through over one hundred subcultures in the absence of streptomycin, (b) Persistence of resistant organisms in the nasopharynx of one patient during a one year period raises an important public health problem.",,H E Alexander;G Leidy

At least 21 million people died from the disease over a 12-month period, becoming one of the world's worst short-term demographic disasters. The disease was introduced into Nigeria by passengers and crews who arrived via ship from overseas. Thus, coastal ports were the primary focus of the diffusion of the disease. Its spread to the hinterland was facilitated by improvements in transportation technology. Neither maritime quarantine, nor the isolation of patients checked the spread of the disease. About 500,000 Nigerians, out of a population of 18 million, died in less than 6 months, and between 50 and 80% of the population was stricken. The over-crowded urban centers were the hardest hit and, even though pandemic declined almost as suddenly as it began, morbidity, mortality, and panic adversely affected the productive capacity of the country. Since the 1930s, virologists have gained much knowledge about the agents responsible for influenza diffusion, but the disease remains one of the few plagues to be eradicated. This is partly because of the exceptional adaptability of influenza viruses, and partly because artificially and naturally-acquired immunity to influenza are temporary in duration, making reinfection possible even by the same type or subtype of influenza.",,D C Ohadike

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24070344/,"Regulating the 1918-19 pandemic: flu, stoicism and the Northcliffe press","Social historians have argued that the reason the 1918–19 ‘Spanish’ influenza left so few traces in public memory is that it was ‘overshadowed’ by the First World War, hence its historiographical characterisation as the ‘forgotten’ pandemic. This paper argues that such an approach tends to overlook the crucial role played by wartime propaganda. Instead, I put emotion words, emotives and metaphors at the heart of my analysis in an attempt to understand the interplay between propaganda and biopolitical discourses that aimed to regulate civilian responses to the pandemic. Drawing on the letters of Wilfred Owen, the diaries of the cultural historian Caroline Playne and the reporting in the Northcliffe press, I argue that the stoicism exhibited by Owen and amplified in the columns of The Times and the Daily Mail is best viewed as a performance, an emotional style that reflected the politicisation of ‘dread’ in war as an emotion with the potential to undermine civilian morale. This was especially the case during the final year of the conflict when war-weariness set in, leading to the stricter policing of negative emotions. As a protean disease that could present as alternately benign and plague-like, the Spanish flu both drew on these discourses and subverted them, disrupting medical efforts to use the dread of foreign pathogens as an instrument of biopower. The result was that, as dread increasingly became attached to influenza, it destabilised medical attempts to regulate the civilian response to the pandemic, undermining Owen’s and the Northcliffe press’s emotives of stoicism.",,Mark Honigsbaum

As influenza infection easily crosses international borders, it is in the interest of all countries to have a high vaccine uptake in people who may be vulnerable when influenza spreads. A Europe-wide monitoring system can provide insight into the strengths and weaknesses of uptake rates in countries and, on ce sufficient levels are achieved, can safeguard the continuation of the achieved levels. This paper aims to address the following issues: a) How is influenza vaccination uptake monitored in Europe? b) What methods to monitor vaccination uptake are available and what are their limitations? c) What steps should be taken to implement a European-wide influenza vaccination uptake monitoring system? Based on existing literature and experiences in monitoring influenza vaccination uptake, an approach to set up a European-wide monitoring system is proposed. The following issues were identified as relevant for influenza vaccination uptake monitoring: a) Agreement on the population groups in which vaccination uptake should be monitored; b) The frequency of data collection; c) The importance of sharing experiences regarding existing influenza vaccination campaigns in order to learn from each other, and develop 'best practices'; d) The need to publish uptake data in close relation with influenza surveillance data and other European efforts on dissemination of vaccination knowledge. To stimulate the discussion on implementing a pan-European influenza uptake monitoring scheme the following recommendations were suggested : a) Develop a common set of variables; b) Build on experience from individual countries; c) Create a coordinating body; d) Create or identify a platform to publish the data; e) Start small and expand rapidly.",,M Kroneman;W J Paget;L E Meuwissen;C Joseph;H Kennedy

Issues arising from the secondary literature review include the quality of evidence on the effectiveness of the vaccines, the absence of a traditional population-based approach to reviewing economic data, confusion in terminology, and how to generalise from resource data contained in primary evaluations. Data from the literature review were summarised in terms of resource units used in the prevention and treatment of influenza. An economic model was constructed using local unit costs (from the Emilia region of Italy) and applying the data to a notional population. The model was sensitive to length of stay in hospital but not to variation in incidence of influenza, days off work or number of medical consultations. The model was predicated on and is sensitive to an estimate of 80% vaccine effectiveness. The approach is constrained by the available data, but could be more generally useful in that it allows variations in the quantity of inputs to be considered separately from variations in their values.

Evidence based on the 2004 U.S. National Nursing Home Survey shows that individuals in nursing homes with high percentages of black residents have less personal immunity to flu because they are less likely to have been vaccinated against the disease; they may also be more likely to be exposed to flu because more of their coresidents are also unvaccinated.

This has been lowered to 13 years in the US after testing of more patients, but this may reflect differential increased testing of school-aged children as part of the pandemic response. The median age of patients with seasonal influenza A(H1N1) infection identified through sentinel surveillance in Western Australia and Victoria in 2007-2008 was 18 and 22 years, respectively. For pandemic influenza H1N1 2009 infection, the median age of the first 244 patients identified in WA was 22 years, and median age of the first 135 patients identified through sentinel surveillance in Victoria was 21 years. Other comparisons of the epidemiological features of pandemic and seasonal influenza are difficult because much less laboratory testing is done for seasonal than for pandemic influenza. While early surveillance data indicated co-circulation of both pandemic and seasonal strains in WA and Victoria, more recent data from both states indicate an increasing predominance of pandemic influenza.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3339326/,Is routine influenza immunization indicated for people over 65 years of age? An opposing view,"It is true that persons aged over 65 years have greater morbidity and mortality from influenza. This increased morbidity and mortality, however, is mostly the result of a higher prevalence of other chronic diseases in the elderly. There is no evidence that vaccination, even in epidemic years when the antigenic match of the influenza strain and the vaccine is good, benefits the 60 percent of the noninstitutionalized population over the age of 65 years who do not have other high-risk diseases. In fact, the grade II-3 evidence cited by the US Preventive Services Task Force actually supports not immunizing this population group. Even among high-risk patients, the benefit from influenza vaccination is highly variable and difficult to demonstrate. In some years there will be little influenza, and little benefit will accrue; in other years the vaccine-influenza antigenic match will not be good, and little benefit will be obtained. In a few years (two of the 12 years during which Barker's studies were done), a reduction in morbidity can be demonstrated for high-risk elderly persons. Even then, vaccine efficacy is only about 33 percent. Patients are telling physicians that they do not feel influenza vaccination is worthwhile. Less than 25 percent of high-risk persons are vaccinated annually. Many of those vaccinated do so because they falsely believe influenza vaccination will prevent the common cold. In accordance with the ACIP recommendation, high-risk patients with concomitant chronic disease (priority 1) should be immunized, because at least some benefit can be demonstrated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,P S Frame

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17507331/,Emergence of drug resistance: implications for antiviral control of pandemic influenza,"Given the danger of an unprecedented spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N1 in humans, and great challenges to the development of an effective influenza vaccine, antiviral drugs will probably play a pivotal role in combating a novel pandemic strain. A critical limitation to the use of these drugs is the evolution of highly transmissible drug-resistant viral mutants. Here, we develop a mathematical model to evaluate the potential impact of an antiviral treatment strategy on the emergence of drug resistance and containment of a pandemic. The results show that elimination of the wild-type strain depends crucially on both the early onset of treatment in indexed cases and population-level treatment. Given the probable delay of 0.5-1 day in seeking healthcare and therefore initiating therapy, the findings indicate that a single strategy of antiviral treatment will be unsuccessful at controlling the spread of disease if the reproduction number of the wild-type strain (R0s) exceeds 1.4. We demonstrate the possible occurrence of a self-sustaining epidemic of resistant strain, in terms of its transmission fitness relative to the wild-type, and the reproduction number R0s. Considering reproduction numbers estimated for the past three pandemics, the findings suggest that an uncontrollable pandemic is likely to occur if resistant viruses with relative transmission fitness above 0.4 emerge. While an antiviral strategy is crucial for containing a pandemic, its effectiveness depends critically on timely and strategic use of drugs.",,Murray E Alexander;Christopher S Bowman;Zhilan Feng;Michael Gardam;Seyed M Moghadas;Gergely Röst;Jianhong Wu;Ping Yan

Perceptions of influenza in rural Southern Malawi,"Influenza virus infections cause between 291 243 and 645 832 deaths annually, with the highest burden in low-income settings. Research in high-income countries has examined public understanding of influenza, but there is little information on views and behaviours about influenza in low-income countries. We explored communities' ideas about the severity, causes, prevention and treatment of influenza in Chikwawa district, Malawi. We conducted 64 in-depth interviews with parents of children aged <5 years, and 7 focus groups with community health workers, parents, and traditional healers. Data were analysed thematically and using a framework matrix to compare views between groups. Respondents held varied ideas about influenza, and many were uncertain about its causes and treatment. Some parents, traditional healers and health workers thought influenza was not severe because they felt it did not cause death or limit activities, but others disagreed. Many saw influenza as a symptom of other conditions, especially malaria and pneumonia, rather than as a disease of its own. Most mentioned dust as the main cause of influenza and believed influenza could be prevented by cleaning the home thoroughly. Treatment seeking for influenza followed different stages, usually starting with home remedies followed by purchasing drugs from groceries and then visiting a health centre. Seeking a clinician tended to be triggered by severe symptoms like high fever or difficulty breathing, and suspicions of malaria or pneumonia. Community health workers provide health education for communities, but some lacked understanding of influenza. Our findings suggest uncertainty about the causes and control of influenza among parents and varied levels of understanding among health providers. Strengthening the capacity of community health workers to provide relevant information about influenza prevention and treatment could address parents' interest in further information and support informed health seeking and engagement with future influenza interventions.",,Mackwellings Phiri;Kate Gooding;Ingrid Peterson;Ivan Mambule;Spencer Nundwe;Meredith McMorrow;Nicola Desmond

However, the mechanisms involved in the emergence of novel influenza virus and the epidemiological factors leading to pandemics are unpredictable. Southern China is postulated as the epicentre of influenza epidemics due to its agricultural-based communities and high population density. Pandemic influenza viruses are through to arise from avian viruses through genetic reassortment among influenza viruses. An influenza virus (H5N1) known to infect only birds previously was found to infect human causing disease and death in Hong Knog in 1997 and the outbreak involved 18 patients with six deaths. Prior to the human outbreak, the H5N1 virus was found to cause extensive death in chickens in three farms in Hong Kong. The significance of this outbreak raised worldwide concern on the possibilities that such an influenza virus may become the next influenza pandemic strain. Investigations were initiated to find the source of the virus. In addition the extend of spread in individuals in contact with the index case and infected poultry was studied by H5-specific serology. Results demonstrated that individuals in close contact with the index case or with exposure to poultry were at risk of being infected. Out of the 18 cases of human infection, eleven had severe infection with symptoms of pneumonia and multi-organ failure. All severe cases presented with lower respiratory infection and lymphopenia and six eventually died. Case-fatality ratio was high among patients over 12 years of age (five out of nine). Control measures aimed at reducing exposure of human to potential H5-positive poultry were instituted which included culling of all poultry in Hong Kong, the segregation of water fowls and chicken, and the introduction of import control measures for chickens. Such measures had successfully controlled the outbreak and continuous surveillance of the poultry in Hong Kong of H5N1 infection is maintained to minimize future human exposure.",,John S Tam

Using a nationally representative random digit dialing telephone survey of 1,055 adult Singaporeans, the authors' results show that the cognitive mediation model can be applied to health contexts, in which motivations (surveillance gratification, guidance, and need for cognition) were positively associated with news attention, elaboration, and interpersonal communication. News attention, elaboration, and interpersonal communication in turn positively influence public knowledge about the H1N1 influenza. In addition, results show that the motivations have significant indirect effects on behavioral intentions, as partially mediated by communication (media attention and interpersonal communication), elaboration, and knowledge. The authors conclude that the cognitive mediation model can be extended to behavioral outcomes, above and beyond knowledge.

We identified ICD-10-coded myositis cases retrospectively 2011-2015 and performed limited chart reviews. We excluded myositis with non-viral causes and cross-referenced with laboratory records of influenza tests to identify confirmed IAM. We defined probable IAM as viral myositis occurring during the influenza season without alternative cause. We described epidemiological and clinical features of IAM and compared IAM with all hospitalised influenza. We identified 283 cases of viral myositis with seasonal peaks (May to October, 85% of cases); 69 were tested for influenza, 52 (78%) were positive. Given the strong seasonality concurrent with the influenza season, we estimated that 80% (95% CI 76-85) of viral myositis is attributable to IAM annually. Of 226 cases of IAM, 21% (n = 49) were confirmed and the remaining probable. IAM was associated with being male (82%), aged 5-9 (73%), and influenza B (86%). The majority had bilateral calf pain; mean creatinine kinase (CK) value was 3579 U/L, and no cases had renal impairment.Conclusion: Childhood viral myositis shows strong association with the influenza season. IAM is clinically stereotyped, age restricted, and benign in most and strongly associated with influenza B. What is Known: • Childhood viral myositis has been reported in association with influenza for decades, more frequently with influenza B and in school-aged children. What is New: • Here, we show over a 5-year period that viral myositis is strongly seasonal with up to 80% of cases attributable to influenza. • Influenza-associated myositis (IAM) typically occurs in boys, aged 5-9 years, with influenza B and is most often benign.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18543597/,"A review of highly pathogenic avian influenza in birds, with an emphasis on Asian H5N1 and recommendations for prevention and control","Avian influenza is a disease of both veterinary and public health importance. Influenza A viruses infect a range of hosts, including humans, and can cause significant morbidity and mortality. These viruses have high genetic variability, and new strains develop through both mutation and reassortment. Modes of transmission as well as the location of viral shedding may differ both by host species and by viral strain. Clinical signs of influenza A virus infection in birds vary considerably depending on the viral subtype, environmental factors, and age, health status, and species of the bird and range from decreased egg production and gastrointestinal manifestations to nervous system disorders and respiratory signs. Most commonly, peracute death with minimal clinical disease is observed in poultry infected with a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. There are various prevention and control strategies for avian influenza, including education, biosecurity, surveillance, culling of infected animals, and vaccination. These strategies will differ by institution and current federal regulations. Each institution should have an established biosecurity protocol that can be properly instituted. Lastly, human health precautions, such as proper hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, and employee health monitoring, are imperative for at-risk individuals.",,Terra R Kelly;Michelle G Hawkins;Christian E Sandrock;Walter M Boyce
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21601606/,"""Wait and see"" vaccinating behaviour during a pandemic: a game theoretic analysis","During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, many individuals did not seek vaccination immediately but rather decided to ""wait and see"" until further information was available on vaccination costs. This behaviour implies two sources of strategic interaction: as more individuals become vaccinated, both the perceived vaccination cost and the probability that susceptible individuals become infected decline. Here we analyze the outcome of these two strategic interactions by combining game theory with a disease transmission model during an outbreak of a novel influenza strain. The model exhibits a ""wait and see"" Nash equilibrium strategy, with vaccine delayers relying on herd immunity and vaccine safety information generated by early vaccinators. This strategic behaviour causes the timing of the epidemic peak to be strongly conserved across a broad range of plausible transmission rates, in contrast to models without such adaptive behaviour. The model exhibits not only feedback mechanisms but also a feed-forward mechanism: a high initial perceived vaccination cost perpetuates high perceived vaccine costs (and lower vaccine coverage) throughout the remainder of the outbreak. This suggests that any effect of risk communication at the start of a pandemic outbreak will be amplified compared to the same amount of risk communication effort distributed throughout the outbreak.",,Samit Bhattacharyya;Chris T Bauch

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1496181/,[Usefulness and limitations of vaccination against influenza],"Influenza viruses have caused major epidemics of respiratory disease and a high mortality in patients with advanced age and in those with underlying health conditions. It has been estimated in the USA that, during a moderate epidemic of influenza, there is an excess of 170,000 hospitalizations and approximately 20,000 to 40,000 influenza-associated deaths per years. Costs may exceed 1 billion dollars per year. Influenza viruses have been difficult to control because of a large animal reservoir and of the frequent change of the virus antigenic structure by major (shift) and minor (drift) variations. Current killed trivalent vaccines are made of two influenza A subtypes plus influenza B virus. Because of the antigenic variation, vaccine composition needs to be changed almost every year in order to contain the strains most likely to be effective. There are two types of vaccines--""whole"" and ""split"". The latter has been treated to reduce pyrogenic components and is particularly indicated in children. Vaccine efficacy varies according to how closely the immunizing strains resemble the circulating wild strain. It also depends on the viral strains which had appeared in the preceding years (herd immunity), on the number of the doses administered and on the interval between the vaccination and the natural challenge. The antibody response to vaccine is short-lived. It is greatest in normal adults and lowest in aged and in immunosuppressed patients.

It is well known that younger individuals interact with one another and society as a whole more than older individuals, suggesting that this could account for the skewed prevalence. However, the observed skewed disease prevalence could also be due to a lesser biological vulnerability (cross-immunity or partial immunity) in the older generation. We develop an age-structured, compartmental mathematical model to quantify the degree to which the skewed disease prevalence among younger individuals is due to a lesser biological vulnerability in the older generation. The model incorporates synthetic data regarding sociological interaction between different age groups generated from the simulation software EpiSims, which allows a clear distinction of the sociological and biological susceptibility effects on the transmission rate of the disease. After fitting the model to available data, we quantify the degree of biological susceptibility of five age groups in the population of the United States.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31031778/,Response Modifiers: Tweaking the Immune Response Against Influenza A Virus,"Despite causing pandemics and yearly epidemics that result in significant morbidity and mortality, our arsenal of options to treat influenza A virus (IAV) infections remains limited and is challenged by the virus itself. While vaccination is the preferred intervention strategy against influenza, its efficacy is reduced in the elderly and infants who are most susceptible to severe and/or fatal infections. In addition, antigenic variation of IAV complicates the production of efficacious vaccines. Similarly, effectiveness of currently used antiviral drugs is jeopardized by the development of resistance to these drugs. Like many viruses, IAV is reliant on host factors and signaling-pathways for its replication, which could potentially offer alternative options to treat infections. While host-factors have long been recognized as attractive therapeutic candidates against other viruses, only recently they have been targeted for development as IAV antivirals. Future strategies to combat IAV infections will most likely include approaches that alter host-virus interactions on the one hand or dampen harmful host immune responses on the other, with the use of biological response modifiers (BRMs). In principle, BRMs are biologically active agents including antibodies, small peptides, and/or other (small) molecules that can influence the immune response. BRMs are already being used in the clinic to treat malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Repurposing such agents would allow for accelerated use against severe and potentially fatal IAV infections. In this review, we will address the potential therapeutic use of different BRM classes to modulate the immune response induced after IAV infections.",antiviral; immune response; immunomodulators; influenza; response modifiers; treatment.,Husni Elbahesh;Thomas Gerlach;Giulietta Saletti;Guus F Rimmelzwaan

Modeling studies suggested that a pandemic may be contained at the source by early treatment and prophylaxis with antiviral drugs. Here, we examine the influence of NI resistant influenza strains on an influenza pandemic. We extend the freely available deterministic simulation program InfluSim to incorporate importations of resistant infections and the emergence of de novo resistance. The epidemic with the fully drug sensitive strain leads to a cumulative number of 19,500 outpatients and 258 hospitalizations, respectively, per 100,000 inhabitants. Development of de novo resistance alone increases the total number of outpatients by about 6% and hospitalizations by about 21%. If a resistant infection is introduced into the population after three weeks, the outcome dramatically deteriorates. Wide-spread use of NI treatment makes it highly likely that the resistant strain will spread if its fitness is high. This situation is further aggravated if a resistant virus is imported into a country in the early phase of an outbreak. As NI-resistant influenza infections with high fitness and pathogenicity have just been observed, the emergence of drug resistance in treated populations and the transmission of drug resistant strains is an important public health concern for seasonal and pandemic influenza.",,Stefan O Brockmann;Markus Schwehm;Hans-Peter Duerr;Mark Witschi;Daniel Koch;Beatriz Vidondo;Martin Eichner

Little is known about the dynamics of the transmission contacts between poultry and human populations, although such understanding is essential for developing effective strategies to control this zoonosis. In this study, we evaluated the effects of contact reductions from live poultry markets (LPMs) closures on the transmission of H7N9 virus during epidemics in Guangdong Province, China. A mathematical model of the poultry-to-person transmission dynamics of H7N9 virus was constructed. The parameters in the model were estimated from publicly available data on confirmed cases of human infection and information on LPMs closure during 2013-2017. By fitting the model, we measured the time-dependent contact quantity of the susceptible population to LPMs. The results showed that periodic intervention strategies can greatly reduce the magnitude of outbreaks, and the earlier interventions for policy are implemented, the smaller is the outbreak. The control efforts for LPMs to decrease the contact quantity are critical in preventing epidemics in the long term. This model should provide important insights for the development of a national intervention strategy for the long-term control of avian influenza virus epidemics.",Contact quantity; H7N9 influenza; Live poultry markets; Mathematical model; Poultry-to-person transmission.,Yue Teng;Dehua Bi;Xiaocan Guo;Dingwen Hu;Dan Feng;Yigang Tong

Volunteers were challenged either with an attenuated strain of influenza A virus or with saline; and excreted nitrate was measured in subsequent 24-h urine samples. Both with and without adjustment for potential confounding by dietary and other factors, it was clear that neither mild nor moderate influenza A virus infection resulted in substantial endogenous nitrate biosynthesis since all the variation in urinary nitrate excretion observed was within the range of normal daily fluctuations.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33886669/,Predicting regional influenza epidemics with uncertainty estimation using commuting data in Japan,"Obtaining an accurate prediction of the number of influenza patients in specific areas is a crucial task undertaken by medical institutions. Infections (such as influenza) spread from person to person, and people are rarely confined to a single area. Therefore, creating a regional influenza prediction model should consider the flow of people between different areas. Although various regional flu prediction models have previously been proposed, they do not consider the flow of people among areas. In this study, we propose a method that can predict the geographical distribution of influenza patients using commuting data to represent the flow of people. To elucidate the complex spatial dependence relations, our model uses an extension of the graph convolutional network (GCN). Additionally, a prediction interval for medical institutions is proposed, which is suitable for cyclic time series. Subsequently, we used the weekly data of flu patients from health authorities as the ground-truth to evaluate the prediction interval and performance of influenza patient prediction in each prefecture in Japan. The results indicate that our GCN-based model, which used commuting data, considerably improved the predictive accuracy over baseline values both temporally and spatially to provide an appropriate prediction interval. The proposed model is vital in practical settings, such as in the decision making of public health authorities and addressing growth in vaccine demand and workload.

Therefore, antiviral drugs are now being stockpiled to be used as a first line of defence. The large-scale use of antivirals will however exert a strong selection pressure on the virus, and may lead to the emergence of drug-resistant strains. A few mathematical models have been developed to assess the emergence of drug resistance during influenza pandemics. These models, however, neglected the spatial structure of large populations and the stochasticity of epidemic and demographic processes. To assess the impact of population structure and stochasticity, we modify and extend a previous model of influenza epidemics into a metapopulation model which takes into account the division of large populations into smaller units, and develop deterministic and stochastic versions of the model. We find that the dynamics in a fragmented population is less explosive, and, as a result, prophylaxis will prevent more infections and lead to fewer resistant cases in both the deterministic and stochastic model. While in the deterministic model the final level of resistance during treatment is not affected by fragmentation, in the stochastic model it is. Our results enable us to qualitatively extrapolate the prediction of deterministic, homogeneous-mixing models to more realistic scenarios.",,Florence Débarre;Sebastian Bonhoeffer;Roland R Regoes
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25172355/,Epitope-based approaches to a universal influenza vaccine,"The development of vaccines has been one of the most important contributions of immunology to public health to date. Although several infectious diseases have all but vanished thanks to effective vaccines, the most common infectious disease, influenza, still represents a major threat to public health. This is more concerning than ever before in light of potentially virulent avian pandemic strains which have emerged in the last decade and infected human hosts, causing high morbidity and mortality. Despite considerable efforts to improve production of influenza vaccines and vaccinate large portions of the population annually, the currently available influenza vaccines are strain-specific and not effective enough. Considering the vulnerability of infants and elderly to seasonal influenza-related complications and the ever present public health threat of a deadly influenza pandemic, there is urgent need for a new kind of influenza vaccine. Ideally, such a vaccine should provide enhanced long term, multi-strain protection without compromising safety and in this way, dramatically improve global protection against seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses. This review highlights one approach to developing a universal influenza vaccine, which is based on highly conserved viral sequences, 'epitopes', that specifically activate humoral and/or cellular immune responses. This approach to vaccinology was pioneered by Prof Arnon, who initiated development of an epitope-based universal vaccine called Multimeric-001 (M-001), which has already been validated in clinical trials to induce broad immunity against A and B-Type, seasonal and pandemic strains.",Influenza; Multimeric-001; Pandemic; Peptide; Seasonal; Vaccines.,Tanya Gottlieb;Tamar Ben-Yedidia

Being younger than 2 years old, having predisposing comorbidities, and/or receiving oseltamivir treatment were significantly associated with longer hospitalization; the latter two were associated with higher hospital charges. On logistic regression analyses, being younger than 2 years old was an independent risk factor for disease severity. Most children hospitalized with pediatric influenza had an uncomplicated clinical course.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22901071/,The impact of school closures on pandemic influenza: Assessing potential repercussions using a seasonal SIR model,"When a new pandemic influenza strain has been identified, mass-production of vaccines can take several months, and antiviral drugs are expensive and usually in short supply. Social distancing measures, such as school closures, thus seem an attractive means to mitigate disease spread. However, the transmission of influenza is seasonal in nature, and as has been noted in previous studies, a decrease in the average transmission rate in a seasonal disease model may result in a larger final size. In the studies presented here, we analyze a hypothetical pandemic using a SIR epidemic model with time- and age-dependent transmission rates; using this model we assess and quantify, for the first time, the the effect of the timing and length of widespread school closures on influenza pandemic final size and average peak time. We find that the effect on pandemic progression strongly depends on the timing of the start of the school closure. For instance, we determine that school closures during a late spring wave of an epidemic can cause a pandemic to become up to 20% larger, but have the advantage that the average time of the peak is shifted by up to two months, possibly allowing enough time for development of vaccines to mitigate the larger size of the epidemic. Our studies thus suggest that when heterogeneity in transmission is a significant factor, decisions of public health policy will be particularly important as to how control measures such as school closures should be implemented.",,Sherry Towers;Katia Vogt Geisse;Chia-Chun Tsai;Qing Han;Zhilan Feng

All medical facilities in the city reported all patients who had positive rapid antigen tests for influenza A. When the epidemic exploded in late October, case-based surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) was implemented from November 3, 2009 until the end of the epidemic. A total of 7,781 influenza cases were reported between July 25 and November 2, 2009, with a cumulative incidence rate of 22.5 per 1,000 population. Nearly 70% of the patients were under 15 years old. Between November 3, 2009 and the end of March 2010, a total of 16,394 ILI cases were reported, with a cumulative incidence rate of 47.4 per 1,000 population. Of the ILI cases reported, 63% were in patients younger than 15 years old. Only one death with laboratory confirmation of the H1N1 2009 virus was reported during the epidemic. The age-specific reproduction number among children under 15 years of age was almost 1.40, whereas between children and adults (15 years of age and above) it was considerably less than 1.0. The reproduction number derived from the next-generation matrix using data from September 30 to October 14 was estimated to be 1.48 (95% confidence interval, 1.41-1.56). Among individuals under 15 years of age, the infection rate calculated using the final size equation under the assumption of no mitigation measures was nearly twice the rate reported during the epidemic.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27435025/,Evaluating the case for trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccines,"Influenza viruses circulate widely throughout the world and it is estimated that they affect between 5 and 15% of the population annually. Since 1977, four viruses co-circulate - two A Viruses (H1N1 and H3N2) and two B viruses (B Yamagata and B Victoria). Type A viruses generally cause up to two thirds of annual infections, although single country studies have shown that B infections may be the predominant virus in the one year in four. Influenza vaccines have traditionally included the hamagglutinins and neuraminidases from the two circulating A viruses and either B Yamagata or B Victoria - however, selecting the B strain for inclusion in these trivalent vaccines has variable success. The alternative approach is to include both B strains in a quadrivalent vaccine. Immunological studies of such vaccines show non-inferiority with a trivalent vaccine comparator, and significant superiority to the additional B strain. Quadrivalent vaccines are more expensive than trivalent preparations but theoretical evidence would suggest they are likely to be more effective and therefore play a much greater role in national immunisation programmes in the future.",Trivalent Quadrivalent Influenza vaccine.,David Baxter

About 10% of these sera specifically inhibited the neuraminidase of the 1957 strain of human influenza (A2/Asian/57), some to high titre.The neuraminidase of A2/Hong Kong/68, which has shown considerable drift in man since 1957, was inhibited to a lesser extent by the shearwater sera while the neuraminidase of influenza A0 (Bel strain) was not inhibited at all. The sera showed no evidence of short-lived antibody to the internal antigen of influenza type A, suggesting that the birds had been infected a considerable time previously with an influenza virus possessing neuraminidase identical to that of the virus causing the human 1957 Asian pandemic. On the other hand, about 10% of the sera from one of the islands was found to be positive in immunodiffusion tests with influenza type A soluble internal antigen (ribonucleoprotein), suggesting that another, much more recent, epidemic of avian influenza had occurred on this island only. The surface antigens of the virus responsible for this epidemic have not so far been identified.Observations suggest that avian influenza may be common in wild birds and the finding of antibody to an antigen of human influenza virus in shearwaters is consistent with the idea that human influenza pandemics may originate from avian or animal reservoirs.",,C A Dasen;W G Laver
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22252006/,The rationale for quadrivalent influenza vaccines,"Two antigenically distinct lineages of influenza B viruses have circulated globally since 1985. However, licensed trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines contain antigens from only a single influenza B virus and thus provide limited immunity against circulating influenza B strains of the lineage not present in the vaccine. In recent years, predictions about which B lineage will predominate in an upcoming influenza season have been no better than chance alone, correct in only 5 of the 10 seasons from 2001 to 2011. Consequently, seasonal influenza vaccines could be improved by inclusion of influenza B strains of both lineages. The resulting quadrivalent influenza vaccines would allow influenza vaccination campaigns to respond more effectively to current global influenza epidemiology. Manufacturing capacity for seasonal influenza vaccines has increased sufficiently to supply quadrivalent influenza vaccines, and methods to identify the influenza B strains to include in such vaccines are in place. Multiple manufacturers have initiated clinical studies of quadrivalent influenza vaccines. Data from those studies, taken together with epidemiologic data regarding the burden of disease caused by influenza B infections, will determine the safety, effectiveness, and benefit of utilizing quadrivalent vaccines for the prevention of seasonal influenza disease.",,Christopher S Ambrose;Myron J Levin

However, even if we can construct the model as finely as possible, it cannot mimic the real world precisely. Therefore, we should use real data for transportation modes and locations, and simulate the diffusion of an infectious disease into that real data. In the present study, we obtained data on the transportation modes and locations of 0.88 million persons a day in the Tokyo metropolitan area. First, we defined the location of all individuals in the data set every 6 min. Second, we determined how many people they came in contact with in their household, in each area, and on the train, and then we assumed that a certain percentage of those contacted would become infected and transmit the disease. Data for natural history and other parameters were taken from previous research. The average number of contacts in each area was 51 748 (95% confidence intervals [CI],46 846-56 650]), at home it was 246 (95% CI, 232-260), and on the train it was 91 (95% CI, 81-101). The number of newly infected people was estimated to be 3032 on day 7 and 126 951 on day 10. The geographic diffusion on day 7, the day when the earliest response would have started, expanded to the whole of the Tokyo metropolitan area.

The source of infection is often unknown, since any patient, healthcare worker (HCW) or visitor is capable of transmitting it to susceptible persons within hospitals. Nosocomial influenza outbreak investigations should help to identify the source of infection, prevent additional cases, and increase our knowledge of disease control to face future outbreaks. However, such outbreaks are probably underdetected and underreported, making routes of transmission difficult to track and describe with precision. In addition, the absence of standardised information in the literature limits comparison between studies and better understanding of disease dynamics. In this study, reports of nosocomial influenza outbreaks are synthesised according to the ORION guidelines to highlight existing knowledge in relation to the detection of influenza cases, evidence of transmission between patients and HCWs and measures of disease incidence.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27974820/,"A Critical, Nonlinear Threshold Dictates Bacterial Invasion and Initial Kinetics During Influenza","Secondary bacterial infections increase morbidity and mortality of influenza A virus (IAV) infections. Bacteria are able to invade due to virus-induced depletion of alveolar macrophages (AMs), but this is not the only contributing factor. By analyzing a kinetic model, we uncovered a nonlinear initial dose threshold that is dependent on the amount of virus-induced AM depletion. The threshold separates the growth and clearance phenotypes such that bacteria decline for dose-AM depletion combinations below the threshold, stay constant near the threshold, and increase above the threshold. In addition, the distance from the threshold correlates to the growth rate. Because AM depletion changes throughout an IAV infection, the dose requirement for bacterial invasion also changes accordingly. Using the threshold, we found that the dose requirement drops dramatically during the first 7d of IAV infection. We then validated these analytical predictions by infecting mice with doses below or above the predicted threshold over the course of IAV infection. These results identify the nonlinear way in which two independent factors work together to support successful post-influenza bacterial invasion. They provide insight into coinfection timing, the heterogeneity in outcome, the probability of acquiring a coinfection, and the use of new therapeutic strategies to combat viral-bacterial coinfections.",,Amber M Smith;Amanda P Smith

Stimulation of a protective response apparently requires more than one exposure to the virus. The virus may then change its surface antigens to render ineffective previously acquired immunity. Ideally, artificial prophylaxis should stimulate better protection than does natural infection and should anticipate antigenic change. Children experience the highest morbidity, accompanied by considerable risk, during influenza epidemics. At the same time, children in school and day care are the most important disseminators of virus in the community. Consideration should be given to providing protection for all children against influenza when effective methods and strategies have been found.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11999801/,New developments in influenza vaccine technology: a potential new prevention strategy for employers and managed care organizations,"Influenza is still one of the most wide-reaching, deadly infectious diseases in the United States, with an estimated 54 million cases and 42,000 deaths in a typical year. At $14 billion, the annual cost of influenza is also enormous. More than 80% of that figure comes from so-called indirect medical costs-eg, the productivity loss that results when a person with influenza misses work. The economic cost makes the disease of special concern to employers, who bear the financial burden of such indirect costs, and to the managed care organizations that serve them. Although several therapies moderate the severity of influenza symptoms, prevention remains the best strategy for reducing the disease's morbidity and mortality, as well as the economic cost. Vaccines composed of inactivated (ie, killed) virus have been available for more than 50 years, and with millions of doses now administered, these inactivated vaccines have earned a strong safety record. When the viral strains contained in the vaccine match those circulating, efficacy against serologically defined infection can be as high as 88%. When the match is not good, however, the inactivated vaccine may have substantially lower efficacy. Another shortcoming is that the inactivated virus vaccine requires injection, which can deter compliance in those who have needle phobia or simply dislike getting shots. These concerns have fueled the development and application for licensing of a cold-adapted, live-attenuated influenza virus vaccine (CAIV), which is administered nasally and is not capable of causing disease. Compared with the inactivated vaccine, the CAIV may have superior efficacy and appears to have similarly minor systemic side effects. In addition, CAIV does not require injection and therefore does not cause local pain or tenderness when administered. This article summarizes recent studies of CAIV indicating that it is effective and safe. With its likelihood of enhanced compliance, its ease of administration, and its potentially superior efficacy, CAIV could play a significant role in influenza prevention.",,John P Williams;Wayne Lednar

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16424427/,Avian influenza virus infections in humans,"Seroepidemiologic and virologic studies since 1889 suggested that human influenza pandemics were caused by H1, H2, and H3 subtypes of influenza A viruses. If not for the 1997 avian A/H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong of China, subtype H2 is the likely candidate for the next pandemic. However, unlike previous poultry outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza due to H5 that were controlled by depopulation with or without vaccination, the presently circulating A/H5N1 genotype Z virus has since been spreading from Southern China to other parts of the world. Migratory birds and, less likely, bird trafficking are believed to be globalizing the avian influenza A/H5N1 epidemic in poultry. More than 200 human cases of avian influenza virus infection due to A/H5, A/H7, and A/H9 subtypes mainly as a result of poultry-to-human transmission have been reported with a > 50% case fatality rate for A/H5N1 infections. A mutant or reassortant virus capable of efficient human-to-human transmission could trigger another influenza pandemic. The recent isolation of this virus in extrapulmonary sites of human diseases suggests that the high fatality of this infection may be more than just the result of a cytokine storm triggered by the pulmonary disease. The emergence of resistance to adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) and recently oseltamivir while H5N1 vaccines are still at the developmental stage of phase I clinical trial are causes for grave concern. Moreover, the to-be pandemic strain may have little cross immunogenicity to the presently tested vaccine strain. The relative importance and usefulness of airborne, droplet, or contact precautions in infection control are still uncertain. Laboratory-acquired avian influenza H7N7 has been reported, and the laboratory strains of human influenza H2N2 could also be the cause of another pandemic.

Prospective viral monitoring of febrile respiratory illness was a useful mirror of the epidemiologic behavior of influenza in the community. Influenza B virus infection in infants and young children was distinguished by high fever and respiratory symptoms and was occasionally associated with otitis media. In older children and young adults, systemic and gastrointestinal complaints were more prominent. Of young children experiencing their first infection, a hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody response was seen in only one-third.

A public survey involving 1,375 respondents was conducted in Anhui Province, China, during the 2013 H7N9 outbreak to test the research model and hypotheses. The results indicate that protective, stakeholder, and risk perceptions influence positively an individual's willingness to take recommended actions. Protective and stakeholder perceptions also have a positive bearing on lay people's risk perceptions. A stakeholder perception is a vital determinant of a protective perception. More importantly, the effects of protective and stakeholder perceptions on behavioural responses to recommendations are mediated in part by risk perception. These findings can help public health officials to develop messages to encourage members of the population to protect themselves effectively during an influenza crisis.",Avian Influenza A; H7N9 emergency; behavioural response; protective perception; recommended preventive action; risk perception; stakeholder perception.,Fei Wang PhD;Jiuchang Wei PhD;Xing Shi

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19737047/,Australia's pandemic 'Protect' strategy: the tension between prevention and patient management,"Recent experience during Australia's initial public health response to the swine influenza pandemic provides valuable lessons for the future. An intense containment effort lasting 7 weeks was unable to prevent local community transmission in some areas of Australia; however, despite the mobility of many people living in rural and remote parts of the country, much of the outback was unaffected. By the end of the Containment Phase, most parts of rural New South Wales only recorded low rates of confirmed H1N109 infection. As Australians living in rural areas often have poorer access to health services than their urban counterparts, they are likely to be more affected by an extended emergency, even one as moderate as the present H1N109 swine influenza pandemic. There may have been benefits in extending containment measures in these less affected areas and in communities where large numbers of vulnerable people such as Indigenous Australians reside. Containment is worthwhile in limiting the spread of disease in specific situations but is unlikely to change the course of a pandemic unless it can be sustained until a large proportion of the population is vaccinated. Strenuous containment efforts should certainly be applied in outbreaks of severe disease, particularly those caused by novel infectious agents with a low reproductive rate (R0). Should advances in vaccine manufacture reduce the time taken to produce a new vaccine, then increased effort to extend containment will be even more worthwhile.",,Keith Eastwood;David N Durrheim;Peter D Massey;Christopher Kewley
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19855818/,The role of genomics in tracking the evolution of influenza A virus,"Influenza A virus causes annual epidemics and occasional pandemics of short-term respiratory infections associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The pandemics occur when new human-transmissible viruses that have the major surface protein of influenza A viruses from other host species are introduced into the human population. Between such rare events, the evolution of influenza is shaped by antigenic drift: the accumulation of mutations that result in changes in exposed regions of the viral surface proteins. Antigenic drift makes the virus less susceptible to immediate neutralization by the immune system in individuals who have had a previous influenza infection or vaccination. A biannual reevaluation of the vaccine composition is essential to maintain its effectiveness due to this immune escape. The study of influenza genomes is key to this endeavor, increasing our understanding of antigenic drift and enhancing the accuracy of vaccine strain selection. Recent large-scale genome sequencing and antigenic typing has considerably improved our understanding of influenza evolution: epidemics around the globe are seeded from a reservoir in East-Southeast Asia with year-round prevalence of influenza viruses; antigenically similar strains predominate in epidemics worldwide for several years before being replaced by a new antigenic cluster of strains. Future in-depth studies of the influenza reservoir, along with large-scale data mining of genomic resources and the integration of epidemiological, genomic, and antigenic data, should enhance our understanding of antigenic drift and improve the detection and control of antigenically novel emerging strains.",,Alice Carolyn McHardy;Ben Adams

The model accounts for both the protection of those immunised and the indirect protection of the rest of the population via herd immunity. The impact of augmenting current practice with a policy to vaccinate pre-school age children, on their own or with school age children, was assessed in terms of quality adjusted life years and health service costs. Vaccinating 2-18 year olds was estimated to be the most cost-effective policy in an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, at an assumed annual vaccine uptake rate of 50%. The mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for this policy was estimated at £251/QALY relative to current practice.

Most recently, a relatively new pandemic, Avian Influenza, has emerged and is resulting in innumerable amounts of damage on a global scale. Already responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of livestock and wild birds, billions of dollars in damages, and hundreds of human deaths, the pandemic has spread through Asia and is continuing its move westward. With new cases being presented in various countries, the continuous loss of animal life, and the increasing vulnerability to the disease of human populations, governments worldwide have begun taking initiatives to prevent the spread, transmission, and deaths resulting from Avian Influenza. In late 2007, the Federal Government of Pakistan created the National Program for the Control and Prevention of Avian Influenza (NPCPAI). Following the completion of two focus group discussions involving 51 women from the Mansehra District, data indicated that with the recent outbreak of such a dangerous disease, many communities were not informed as to how to prevent the spread and transmission of Avian Influenza. As a result of government-sponsored interventions, through the use of training sessions involving the dissemination of all necessary information regarding Avian Influenza, the individuals who had taken part in the training were much more likely than the uninformed groups to be able to spot the disease, prevent its transmission to other livestock, decontaminate infected areas, and prevent contraction of the disease by themselves and their families. As a result of the success of this program, recommendations for the future include widespread awareness campaigns using mass media resources, training sessions dispersed throughout the regions, and increased funding for current and future projects involving research on prevention and treatment for Avian Influenza.",,Muhiuddin Haider;Jared Frank;Shahzia Noreen

Up to the present time, influenza viruses with hemagglutinin H5 were known to circulate only among birds. They caused a variety of diseases: from asymptomatic to epizootic with 100% mortality, particularly among chickens. The main difference between virulent and avirulent strains is as follows: virulent viruses are isolated from all tissues of an infected bird. A (H5) virus hemagglutinin, transformed into a virulent variant, becomes sensitive to cleavage by proteases of mammalian and avian cells. Intensive epidemiological surveillance of influenza in Hong Kong started by the WHO and Department of Public Health of Hong Kong in August-September, 1997, resulted in detection of 17 more cases with Influenza A (H5N1) in November-December 1997. all of the occurred before December 28, 1997 and were detected in hospitals and health centers of Hong Kong. Nine patients were children aged under 5 years. Six patients died as a result of complications (pneumonia) and exacerbations of concomitant chronic diseases. Virological and logical studies showed that the main route of infection transmission was from birds to humans. Human to human transmission is probable. Study of 7 influenza A (H5N1) viruses isolated from patients showed that they contained all 8 RNA gene segments of avian virus.

Such a prevention strategy was stricter than other non-pharmaceutical interventions that were carried out in many other countries. We evaluated the effectiveness of the mandatory quarantine and provide suggestions for interventions against possible future influenza pandemics. We selected one city, Beijing, as the analysis target. We reviewed the epidemiologic dynamics of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and the implementation of quarantine measures in Beijing. The infectious population was simulated under two scenarios (quarantined and not quarantined) using a deterministic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model. The basic reproduction number R0 was adjusted to match the epidemic wave in Beijing. We found that mandatory quarantine served to postpone the spread of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Beijing by one and a half months. If mandatory quarantine was not enforced in Beijing, the infectious population could have reached 1,553 by 21 October, i.e., 5.6 times higher than the observed number.

This paper examines these analyses, and attempts to recreate the three most recent statistical analyses by Ertel (1994), Tapping et al. (2001), and Yeung (2006), which all have purported to find a significant relationship between sunspot numbers and pandemic influenza. As will be discussed, each analysis had errors in the data. In addition, in each analysis arbitrary selections or assumptions were also made, and the authors did not assess the robustness of their analyses to changes in those arbitrary assumptions. Varying the arbitrary assumptions to other, equally valid, assumptions negates the claims of significance. Indeed, an arbitrary selection made in one of the analyses appears to have resulted in almost maximal apparent significance; changing it only slightly yields a null result. This analysis applies statistically rigorous methodology to examine the purported sunspot/pandemic link, using more statistically powerful un-binned analysis methods, rather than relying on arbitrarily binned data. The analyses are repeated using both the Wolf and Group sunspot numbers. In all cases, no statistically significant evidence of any association was found. However, while the focus in this particular analysis was on the purported relationship of influenza pandemics to sunspot activity, the faults found in the past analyses are common pitfalls; inattention to analysis reproducibility and robustness assessment are common problems in the sciences, that are unfortunately not noted often enough in review.",,S Towers

From week 50 onwards, a strong increase of the clinical influenza activity was observed which reached its peak in weeks 1 and 2 of 2000 and then rapidly declined. The clinical influenza activity was associated with the isolation of predominantly influenza A (H3N2) viruses. Near the end of the epidemic, influenza A (H1N1) and influenza B viruses were isolated sporadically. The antigenic properties of the influenza A (H3N2) viruses resembled those of the epidemic strains isolated in the previous season and the vaccine strain A/Sydney/5/97. This influenza season, influenza B viruses did not play a significant role and they matched the vaccine strain B/Yamanashi/166/98. In addition, a small number of influenza A (H1N1) viruses were isolated. Some of these viruses resembled the old variant of influenza A (H1N1) viruses, A/Bayern/7/95, whilst others showed a close antigenic relationship with the vaccine strain recommended for the next influenza season, A/New Caledonia/20/99. For the influenza season 2000/'01, it is recommended by the World Health Organization that the vaccines contain the following (or similar) virus strains: A/Moscow/10/99 (H3N2), A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) and B/Beijing/184/93.",,G F Rimmelzwaan;J C de Jong;A I Bartelds;J W Dorigo-Zetsma;R A Fouchier;A D Osterhaus

It caused a very large epidemic in Hong Kong and spread rapidly to countries as far as India and the Northern Territory of Australia-as happened in the 1957 epidemic. Later its progress slowed down but epidemics occurred in many countries in the northern hemisphere in the winter of 1968-69. In all these countries except the United States of America the disease was mild and not associated with a large increase of deaths. In the United States of America, however, the number of ""excess deaths"" was similar to the number in 1957-58.In the southern hemisphere epidemics began in May-June 1969; they have been clinically mild and the reported incidence of disease has been only moderately high.In many countries the infection has spread slowly and smouldered instead of bursting into the usual sharp epidemics.The smouldering spread and the contrast in the behaviour of the disease in the USA compared with the rest of the world are the outstanding features of the Hong Kong strain of virus.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17115951/,Pandemic influenza: clinical issues,"Influenza is an acute febrile illness caused by influenza A or B viruses. It occurs mainly in winter in temperate climates, and throughout the year in tropical Australia. It is highly contagious and of considerable public health concern because of the rapidity with which epidemics evolve and the associated morbidity and mortality. Most influenza illnesses resolve over about 1 week without specific medical intervention. People at particular risk for complicated infection are those > 65 or < 5 years old, those with chronic medical comorbidities, residents of chronic care facilities (including nursing homes), and women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Complicated influenza infection most commonly manifests as primary viral pneumonia, combined viral and bacterial pneumonia, and secondary bacterial pneumonia. Rare but serious complications of influenza include central nervous system involvement (eg, encephalitis, transverse myelitis, aseptic meningitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome). The recent emergence of avian influenza A/H5N1 and confirmation of sporadic cases of human H5N1 infection have heightened concern about an impending human influenza pandemic, either from a human form of H5N1 or a primary new human influenza strain.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30778136/,Assessing the Dynamics and Control of Droplet- and Aerosol-Transmitted Influenza Using an Indoor Positioning System,"There is increasing evidence that aerosol transmission is a major contributor to the spread of influenza. Despite this, virtually all studies assessing the dynamics and control of influenza assume that it is transmitted solely through direct contact and large droplets, requiring close physical proximity. Here, we use wireless sensors to measure simultaneously both the location and close proximity contacts in the population of a US high school. This dataset, highly resolved in space and time, allows us to model both droplet and aerosol transmission either in isolation or in combination. In particular, it allows us to computationally quantify the potential effectiveness of overlooked mitigation strategies such as improved ventilation that are available in the case of aerosol transmission. Our model suggests that recommendation-abiding ventilation could be as effective in mitigating outbreaks as vaccinating approximately half of the population. In simulations using empirical transmission levels observed in households, we find that bringing ventilation to recommended levels had the same mitigating effect as a vaccination coverage of 50% to 60%. Ventilation is an easy-to-implement strategy that has the potential to support vaccination efforts for effective control of influenza spread.",,Timo Smieszek;Gianrocco Lazzari;Marcel Salathé
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2376460/,Simulation of mechanisms of viral interference in influenza,"Biological interference among viral agents might have significant implications for disease prevention and therapy. Field data for influenza yield conflicting evidence concerning the independence of infection rates, or disease severity, for two co-circulating viruses. To examine the effects of several assumed modes of interference for influenza, simulations of a Monte Carlo micropopulation model of influenza epidemics have been performed. Model parameters were selected so that the simulated attack rates for each of two different viral strains matched actual field data. Rates of infection were compared for single agents and for two viruses with only behavioural interference. Other simulations included temporary immunity to the other virus for the duration of the infection, and/or reduced shedding of viral particles for dual infections. Simulated viral competition had little impact on epidemic severity, duration, or size distribution. Under the conditions studied, viral interference in natural populations would be difficult to infer from field observations of attack rates. Other simulations extended a partial immunity and/or reduced viral shedding during an infection with a second virus. These indicated that interference might be suggested by field data, but it could not be demonstrated conclusively. Still other simulations showed that for epidemics with much higher attack rates for both viruses, it would be relatively easy to demonstrate interference. However, in order to observe interference between influenza strains, it would be necessary to monitor on an almost daily basis, using a method of viral detection which would have to be both highly specific and also very sensitive.",,E Ackerman;I M Longini Jr;S K Seaholm;A S Hedin

Specific diagnostic tests, especially RT-PCR, were not available throughout the country. To assist early clinical diagnosis and treatment, this study compared the clinical features and treatment outcomes of children presenting with influenza-like illness (ILIs). These included confirmed cases of A(H1N1)pdm2009, as well as seasonal influenza and cases for which no cause could be specified. The medical records of patients aged less than 15 years with ILIs, who had RT-PCR performed for influenza virus between May 2009 and December 2011 at Srinagarind Hospital, were reviewed. Clinical features, chest radiographs and treatment outcomes were compared between those positive for A(H1N1)pdm2009, and those with seasonal influenza and/or the unspecified causes group. In 179 complete medical records, 27.4% were positive for A(H1N1)pdm2009, 13.4% for seasonal influenza and the cause of illness in the remainder was unspecified. Both A(H1N1)pdm2009 and seasonal influenza viruses infected older children more than did the unspecified group (group median ages 96,48 and 24 months, respectively).

Specifically, we focus on the sensitivity of the cost-effectiveness ratios to model choice, to the assumed drug coverage, and to the value of several epidemiological factors. Therapeutic use of AV-drugs is cost-effective compared with non-intervention, irrespective of which model approach is chosen. The findings further show that: (1) the cost-effectiveness ratio according to the static model is insensitive to the size of a pandemic, whereas the ratio according to the dynamic model increases with the size of a pandemic; (2) according to the dynamic model, the cost per infection and the life-years gained per treatment are not constant but depend on the proportion of cases that are treated; and (3) the age-specific clinical attack rates affect the sensitivity of cost-effectiveness ratio to model choice.",,Anna K Lugnér;Sido D Mylius;Jacco Wallinga

Effective preventive strategies are based upon early accurate viral diagnosis and an appreciation of the epidemiology and mechanisms of transmission for each viral agent. Influenza viruses spread via airborne dispersion of small particle aerosols, resulting in explosive outbreaks; control measures emphasize immunization and chemoprophylaxis of susceptible patients and personnel, and isolation of those already infected. Transmission of respiratory syncytial virus, in contrast, seems to require closer contact, with virus passed on hands, fomites, or in large droplets inoculated into the eyes and nose at close range.

During influenza epidemics, death rates among patients with diabetes mellitus may increase by 5-15%. Diabetes mellitus is also mentioned as a risk factor in most clinical studies, making up 3-14% of the patients studied. Even in recent studies, diabetes mellitus is only preceded as a risk factor by cardiovascular disease and chronic pulmonary disorders. To what extent cardiovascular disease and old age contribute to the increased influenza mortality and morbidity in diabetic patients remains unclear. The influence of epidemic influenza on the incidence of diabetic acidosis in combination with an impaired immune response to both Staphylococcus aureus and the influenza virus suggests that diabetes mellitus itself is the main risk factor. It is concluded that all patients with diabetes mellitus should receive annual vaccinations and that, in official recommendations, patients with diabetes mellitus should be mentioned as a separate risk group.

The objective of this work is to investigate whether the effect of resistance can be contained through a time-dependent treatment strategy during the epidemic subject to an isoperimetric constraint. We apply control theory to a population dynamical model of influenza infection with drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains, and solve the associated control problem to find the optimal treatment profile that minimizes the cumulative number of infections (i.e. the epidemic final size). We consider the problem under the assumption of limited drug stockpile and show that as the size of stockpile increases, a longer delay in start of treatment is required to minimize the total number of infections. Our findings show that the amount of drugs used to minimize the total number of infections depends on the rate of de novo resistance regardless of the initial size of drug stockpile. We demonstrate that both the rate of resistance emergence and the relative transmissibility of the resistant strain play important roles in determining the optimal timing and level of treatment profile.",,Majid Jaberi-Douraki;Seyed M Moghadas

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30349811/,Back to the Future: Lessons Learned From the 1918 Influenza Pandemic,"2018 marks the 100-year anniversary of the 1918 influenza pandemic, which killed ~50 million people worldwide. The severity of this pandemic resulted from a complex interplay between viral, host, and societal factors. Here, we review the viral, genetic and immune factors that contributed to the severity of the 1918 pandemic and discuss the implications for modern pandemic preparedness. We address unresolved questions of why the 1918 influenza H1N1 virus was more virulent than other influenza pandemics and why some people survived the 1918 pandemic and others succumbed to the infection. While current studies suggest that viral factors such as haemagglutinin and polymerase gene segments most likely contributed to a potent, dysregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine storm in victims of the pandemic, a shift in case-fatality for the 1918 pandemic toward young adults was most likely associated with the host's immune status. Lack of pre-existing virus-specific and/or cross-reactive antibodies and cellular immunity in children and young adults likely contributed to the high attack rate and rapid spread of the 1918 H1N1 virus. In contrast, lower mortality rate in in the older (>30 years) adult population points toward the beneficial effects of pre-existing cross-reactive immunity. In addition to the role of humoral and cellular immunity, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that individual genetic differences, especially involving single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), contribute to differences in the severity of influenza virus infections. Co-infections with bacterial pathogens, and possibly measles and malaria, co-morbidities, malnutrition or obesity are also known to affect the severity of influenza disease, and likely influenced 1918 H1N1 disease severity and outcomes. Additionally, we also discuss the new challenges, such as changing population demographics, antibiotic resistance and climate change, which we will face in the context of any future influenza virus pandemic. In the last decade there has been a dramatic increase in the number of severe influenza virus strains entering the human population from animal reservoirs (including highly pathogenic H7N9 and H5N1 viruses). An understanding of past influenza virus pandemics and the lessons that we have learnt from them has therefore never been more pertinent.",1918; external factors; host factors; influenza; pandemic; prevention; societal factors; viral factors.,Kirsty R Short;Katherine Kedzierska;Carolien E van de Sandt

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21356137/,Effects of vaccination and population structure on influenza epidemic spread in the presence of two circulating strains,"Background: Human influenza is characterized by seasonal epidemics, caused by rapid viral adaptation to population immunity. Vaccination against influenza must be updated annually, following surveillance of newly appearing viral strains. During an influenza season, several strains may be co-circulating, which will influence their individual evolution; furthermore, selective forces acting on the strains will be mediated by the transmission dynamics in the population. Clearly, viral evolution and public health policy are strongly interconnected. Understanding population-level dynamics of coexisting viral influenza infections, would be of great benefit in designing vaccination strategies.",,Murray E Alexander;Randy Kobes

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17132338/,Pandemic influenza: overview of vaccines and antiviral drugs,"Pandemic influenza has become a high priority item for all public health authorities. An influenza pandemic is believed to be imminent, and scientists agree that it will be a matter of when, where, and what will be the causative agent. Recently, most attention has been directed to human cases of avian influenza caused by a H5N1 avian influenza virus. An effective vaccine will be needed to substantially reduce the impact of an influenza pandemic. Current influenza vaccine manufacturing technology is not adequate to support vaccine production in the event of an avian influenza outbreak, and it has now become clear that new innovative production technology is required. Antiviral drugs, on the other hand, can play a very important role in slowing the disease spread but are in short supply and resistance has been a major issue.

Through development of antigenicity inference method for human influenza A (H1N1), named PREDAC-H1, we systematically mapped the antigenic patterns and evolution of the human influenza A (H1N1) virus. Eight dominant antigenic clusters have been inferred for seasonal H1N1 viruses since 1977, which demonstrated sequential replacements over time with a similar pattern in Asia, Europe and North America. Among them, six clusters emerged first in Asia. As for China, three of the eight antigenic clusters were detected in South China earlier than in North China, indicating the leading role of South China in H1N1 transmission.

Eighteen countries in Europe report weekly influenza activity to EISS (http://www.eiss.org). A questionnaire on the virological data collection was sent electronically to the EISS members. Questions on the specimen collection, representativity, laboratory diagnosis of influenza, reporting of variants, testing for other respiratory infections, serological testing, near-patient tests and preparedness for a pandemic were included. The results of the survey showed that for the typing of influenza, the methods polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) methods are used most frequently. For the subtyping of influenza, HAI and PCR are used most often. An east-west divide was seen for the use of PCR in typing and subtyping (more PCR use in the west). Differences in the virological surveillance systems in Europe can make direct comparisons difficult because detection rates may differ by test. For the reporting of other respiratory infections besides influenza, many networks (68%) collect information on RSV. This is important because RSV causes similar clinical symptoms as influenza and can have a similar impact in terms of burden of disease. With the collection of RSV data, EISS is moving to a broader spectrum of viral respiratory diseases.

It is urgent to develop effective methods and tools for the prevention and treatment of influenza. Influenza vaccines have significant immune response variability across the population. Most of the current circulating strains of influenza A virus are resistant to anti-influenza drugs. It is necessary to understand how genetic variants affect immune responses, especially responses to the HA and NA transmembrane glycoproteins. The elucidation of the underlying mechanisms can help identify patient subgroups for effective prevention and treatment. New personalized vaccines, adjuvants, and drugs may result from the understanding of interactions of host genetic, environmental, and other factors. The systems biology approach is to simulate and model large networks of the interacting components, which can be excellent targets for antiviral therapies. The elucidation of host-influenza interactions may provide an integrative view of virus infection and host responses. Understanding the host-influenza-drug interactions may contribute to optimal drug combination therapies. Insight of the host-influenza-vaccine interactions, especially the immunogenetics of vaccine response, may lead to the development of better vaccines.

In contrast, human H3 and avian H1 viruses have been isolated frequently from pigs in Europe and Asia over the last two decades. From September 1997 through August 1998, we isolated 26 influenza viruses from pigs in the north central United States at the point of slaughter. All 26 isolates were H1N1 viruses, and phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein genes from 11 representative viruses demonstrated that these were classical swine H1 viruses.
