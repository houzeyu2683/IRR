We aim to conduct this review to summarize the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of these patients and discuss the potential explanations for recurrences, the contagiousness of re-detectable positive SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the management of COVID-19 patients after discharge from hospital. The proportion of re-positive tests in discharged COVID-19 patients varied from 2.4 to 69.2% and persisted from 1 to 38 days after discharge, depending on population size, age of patients, and type of specimens. Currently, several causes of re-positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 in recovered COVID-19 patients are suggested, including false-negative, false-positive RT-PCR tests; reactivation; and re-infection with SARS-CoV-2, but the mechanism leading to these re-positive cases is still unclear. The prevention of re-positive testing in discharged patients is a fundamental measure to control the spread of the pandemic. In order to reduce the percentage of false-negative tests prior to discharge, we recommend performing more than two tests, according to the standard sampling and microbiological assay protocol. In addition, specimens should be collected from multiple body parts if possible, to identify SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA before discharge. Further studies should be conducted to develop novel assays that target a crucial region of the RNA genome in order to improve its sensitivity and specificity.",COVID-19; Discharge; False-negative; False-positive; PCR; Recovery; Recurrence; SARS-CoV-2.,Thi Loi Dao;Van Thuan Hoang;Philippe Gautret

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33394144/,Detection technologies and recent developments in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection,"COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 capable of causing mild to severe infections in humans. Since its first appearance in China in December 2019, the pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world. Despite considerable efforts made to contain the disease, the virus has continued its prevalence in many countries with varying degrees of clinical manifestations. To contain this pandemic, collaborative approach involving accurate diagnosis, epidemiology, surveillance, and prophylaxis is essential. However, proper diagnosis using rapid technologies plays a crucial role. With increasing incidence of COVID-19 cases, the accurate and early detection of the SARS-CoV-2 is need of the hour for effective prevention and management of COVID-19 cases as well as to curb its spread. RT-qPCR assay is considered to be the gold standard for the early detection of virus, but this protocol has limited application to use as bedside test because of its technical complexity. To address these challenges, several POC assays have been developed to facilitate the COVID-19 diagnosis outside the centralized testing laboratories as well to accelerate the clinical decision making with a least turnaround time. Hence, in this report, we review different nucleic acid-based and serological techniques available for the diagnosis and effective prevention of COVID-19.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33308664/,Benefits and limitations of serological assays in COVID-19 infection,"Accurate and rapid diagnostic tests are critical for achieving control of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), a pandemic illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Diagnostic tests for covid-19 fall into two main categories: molecular tests that detect viral RNA, and serological tests that detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a molecular test, has become the gold standard for diagnosis of covid-19; however, this test has many limitations that include potential false negative results, changes in diagnostic accuracy over the disease course, and precarious availability of test materials. Serological tests have generated substantial interest as an alternative or complement to RT-PCR and other Nucleic acid tests in the diagnosis of acute infection, as some might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care. A clear advantage of these tests over RT-PCR is that they can identify individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, even if they never underwent testing while acutely ill. Many serological tests for covid-19 have become available in a short period, including some marketed for use as rapid, point-of-care tests. The pace of development has, however, exceeded that of rigorous evaluation, and important uncertainty about test accuracy remains.",COVID-19; IgG; IgM; SARS CoV-2; Serology.,Zeeshan Sidiq;M Hanif;Kaushal Kumar Dwivedi;K K Chopra

A meta-analysis was carried out to identify studies on COVID-19 from 25 December 2019 to 30 April 2020. A total of 48 studies with 5829 pediatric patients were included. Children of all ages were at risk for COVID-19. The main illness classification ranged as: 20% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14%-26%; I2 = 91.4%) asymptomatic, 33% (95% CI: 23%-43%; I2 = 95.6%) mild and 51% (95% CI: 42%-61%; I2 = 93.4%) moderate. The typical clinical manifestations were fever 51% (95% CI: 45%-57%; I2 = 78.9%) and cough 41% (95% CI: 35%-47%, I2 = 81.0%). The common laboratory findings were normal white blood cell 69% (95% CI: 64%-75%; I2 = 58.5%), lymphopenia 16% (95% CI: 11%-21%; I2 = 76.9%) and elevated creatine-kinase MB 37% (95% CI: 25%-48%; I2 = 59.0%). The frequent imaging features were normal images 41% (95% CI: 30%-52%; I2 = 93.4%) and ground-glass opacity 36% (95% CI: 25%-47%; I2 = 92.9%). Among children under 1 year old, critical cases account for 14% (95% CI: 13%-34%; I2 = 37.3%) that should be of concern.

SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two other coronaviruses that caused disease epidemic breakouts in humans in the last 2 decades, namely, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The similarities have enabled the scientists to apply the basic scientific discoveries garnered from studying the structure and modus operandi of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to develop therapies that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 and to develop vaccines to prevent COVID-19. Targeted therapies including the use of antibodies to prevent virus entry, nucleotide analogues to prevent viral replication, and inhibitors of proteases to prevent virion formation, among others, are being tested for their clinical efficacy. Likewise, complete sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 and identification of its structural and nonstructural proteins have enabled development of RNA-, DNA-, and peptide-based vaccines as well attenuated viral vaccines to instigate the host-immune responses.

COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus that leads to a variety of symptoms in humans, including cough, fever and respiratory failure. SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger extensive immune responses, including the production of antibodies. The detection of antibody response by serological testing provides a supplementary diagnostic tool to molecular tests. We hereby present a succinct yet comprehensive review on the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as molecular mechanisms behind the strengths and limitations of serological antibody tests. The presence of antibodies can be detected in patient sera within days post symptom onset. Serological tests demonstrate superior sensitivity to molecular tests in some periods of time during disease development. Compared with the molecular tests, serological tests can be used for point-of-care testing, providing faster results at a lower cost. Commercially available serological tests show variable sensitivity and specificity, and the molecular basis of these variabilities are analysed. We discuss assays of different complexities that are used to specifically quantitate neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which has important implications for vaccine development and herd immunity.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnostic assays play a central role in diagnosis and have fixed technical performance metrics. Interpretation becomes challenging because the clinical sensitivity changes as the virus clears and the immune response emerges. Our goal was to examine the clinical sensitivity of two most common SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test modalities, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology, over the disease course to provide insight into their clinical interpretation in patients presenting to the hospital. We conducted a single-center, retrospective study. To derive clinical sensitivity of PCR, we identified 209 PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 patients with multiple PCR test results (624 total PCR tests) and calculated daily sensitivity from date of symptom onset or first positive test. Clinical sensitivity of PCR decreased with days post symptom onset with >90% clinical sensitivity during the first 5 days after symptom onset, 70%-71% from Days 9 to 11, and 30% at Day 21. To calculate daily clinical sensitivity by serology, we utilized 157 PCR-positive patients with a total of 197 specimens tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IgM, IgG, and IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In contrast to PCR, serological sensitivity increased with days post symptom onset with >50% of patients seropositive by at least one antibody isotype after Day 7, >80% after Day 12, and 100% by Day 21. Taken together, PCR and serology are complimentary modalities that require time-dependent interpretation. Superimposition of sensitivities over time indicate that serology can function as a reliable diagnostic aid indicating recent or prior infection.",COVID; SARS-CoV-2; biomarker; qPCR.,Tyler E Miller;Wilfredo F Garcia Beltran;Adam Z Bard;Tasos Gogakos;Melis N Anahtar;Michael Gerino Astudillo;Diane Yang;Julia Thierauf;Adam S Fisch;Grace K Mahowald;Megan J Fitzpatrick;Valentina Nardi;Jared Feldman;Blake M Hauser;Timothy M Caradonna;Hetal D Marble;Lauren L Ritterhouse;Sara E Turbett;Julie Batten;Nicholas Zeke Georgantas;Galit Alter;Aaron G Schmidt;Jason B Harris;Jeffrey A Gelfand;Mark C Poznansky;Bradley E Bernstein;David N Louis;Anand Dighe;Richelle C Charles;Edward T Ryan;John A Branda;Virginia M Pierce;Mandakolathur R Murali;A John Iafrate;Eric S Rosenberg;Jochen K Lennerz

Between March 16 and June 2, 2020, 132 kidney transplant recipients tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. From May 3 to July 29, 2020, 912 kidney transplant recipients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies during routine clinic visits, of which 16.6% tested positive. Fifty-five of the 152 patients had previously tested positive by RT-PCR, while the remaining 97 did not have significant symptoms and had not been previously tested by RT-PCR. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 23.4% in the 975 patients tested by either RT-PCR or SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Older patients and patients with higher serum creatinine levels were more likely diagnosed by RT-PCR compared to SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Sixty-nine RT-PCR positive patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at a median of 44 days post-diagnosis (Inter Quartile Range 31-58) and 80% were positive. Overall mortality was 20.5% but significantly higher (37.8%) in the patients who required hospitalization. Twenty-three percent of the hospitalized patients required kidney replacement therapy and 6.3% lost their allografts. In multivariable analysis, older age, receipt of deceased-donor transplantation, lack of influenza vaccination in the previous year and higher serum interleukine-6 levels were associated with mortality. Thus, 42% of patients with a kidney transplant and with COVID-19 were diagnosed on antibody testing without significant clinical symptoms; 80% of patients with positive RT-PCR developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG and mortality was high among patients requiring hospitalization.",COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody; kidney transplantation; mortality.,Yorg Azzi;Michael Parides;Omar Alani;Pablo Loarte-Campos;Rachel Bartash;Stefanie Forest;Adriana Colovai;Maria Ajaimy;Luz Liriano-Ward;Cindy Pynadath;Jay Graham;Marie Le;Stuart Greenstein;Juan Rocca;Milan Kinkhabwala;Enver Akalin

In this study, eighty-eight reported COVID-19 patients in Wuhan were recruited from January to February, 2020, including 32 severe/critical cases and 56 mild/moderate cases. Their mean age was 56.43 years (range 17-83) and gender ratio (male/female) was 43:45. We tested SARS-CoV-2 RNA with commercial kits, investigated the level of serologic IgM and IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using magnetic particle chemiluminescence immunoassays, and compared the results of serologic tests and nucleic acid test (NAT). Among 88 patients, 95.45% were confirmed as positive by the combination of NAT and antibody test, which was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than by single nucleic acid test (73.86%) or serologic test (65.91%). Then the correlation between temporal profile and the level of antibody response was analyzed. It showed that seroconversion started on day 5 after disease onset and IgG level was rose earlier than IgM. Comparison between patients with different disease severity suggested early seroconversion and high antibody titer were linked with less severe clinical symptoms. These results supported the combination of serologic testing and NAT in routine COVID-19 diagnosis and provided evidence on the temporal profile of antibody response in patients with different disease severity.",COVID-19; Chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA); Nucleic acid test (NAT); Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCT); Serologic test.,Wen-Hua Kong;Rong Zhao;Jun-Bo Zhou;Fang Wang;De-Guang Kong;Jian-Bin Sun;Qiong-Fang Ruan;Man-Qing Liu

Generally, total Ab bridging assays combine good sensitivity with high specificity. Therefore, we developed sensitive total Ab bridging assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 Abs to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein in addition to conventional isotype-specific assays. Ab kinetics was assessed in PCR-confirmed, hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients (n = 41) and three populations of patients with COVID-19 symptoms not requiring hospital admission: PCR-confirmed convalescent plasmapheresis donors (n = 182), PCR-confirmed hospital care workers (n = 47), and a group of longitudinally sampled symptomatic individuals highly suspect of COVID-19 (n = 14). In nonhospitalized patients, the Ab response to RBD is weaker but follows similar kinetics, as has been observed in hospitalized patients. Across populations, the RBD bridging assay identified most patients correctly as seropositive. In 11/14 of the COVID-19-suspect cases, seroconversion in the RBD bridging assay could be demonstrated before day 12; nucleocapsid protein Abs emerged less consistently. Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility of finger-prick sampling for Ab detection against SARS-CoV-2 using these assays. In conclusion, the developed bridging assays reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 Abs in hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients and are therefore well suited to conduct seroprevalence studies.",,"Erik H Vogelzang;Floris C Loeff;Ninotska I L Derksen;Simone Kruithof;Pleuni Ooijevaar-de Heer;Gerard van Mierlo;Federica Linty;Juk Yee Mok;Wim van Esch;Sanne de Bruin;Alexander P J Vlaar;Amsterdam University Medical Center COVID-19 Biobank Study Group,;Bart Seppen;Maureen Leeuw;Anne J G van Oudheusden;Anton G M Buiting;Kin Ki Jim;Hans Vrielink;Francis Swaneveld;Gestur Vidarsson;C Ellen van der Schoot;Peter C Wever;Wentao Li;Frank van Kuppeveld;Jean-Luc Murk;Berend Jan Bosch;Gerrit-Jan Wolbink;Theo Rispens"

To date, approximately one million deaths and over 32 million cases have been reported. This ongoing pandemic urgently requires an accurate testing device that can be used in the field in a fast manner. Serological assays to detect antibodies have been proven to be a great complement to the standard method of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), particularly after the second week of infection. We have developed a specific and sensitive immunosensor for immunoglobulin detection produced against SARS-CoV-2. Unlike other lateral flow-based assays (LFAs) involving the utilization of multiple antibodies, we have reported a label-free paper-based electrochemical platform targeting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies without the specific requirement of an antibody. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will interrupt the redox conversion of the redox indicator, resulting in a decreased current response. This electrochemical sensor was proven effective in real clinical sera from patients with satisfactory results. In addition, the proposed format was also extended to antigen detection (the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2), which presents new possibilities for diagnosing COVID-19.",COVID-19; Electrochemical detection; Paper-based sensors; SARS-CoV-2.,Abdulhadee Yakoh;Umaporn Pimpitak;Sirirat Rengpipat;Nattiya Hirankarn;Orawon Chailapakul;Sudkate Chaiyo

To meet diagnostic needs as the pandemic grows, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently granted several commercial SARS-CoV-2 tests Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), but manufacturer-independent evaluation data are scarce. We performed the first manufacturer-independent evaluation of the fully automated sample-to-result two-target test cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 (cobas) (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ), which received U.S. FDA EUA on 12 March 2020.

To date, no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are therefore critical for controlling the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic and optimizing clinical care, infection control, and public health interventions. The FDA has issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for hundreds of COVID-19 diagnostic tests of different classes. Whereas nucleic acid testing (NAT) such as RT-PCR remains the criterion standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, serological antibody and antigen tests are increasingly being developed. Tests based on the novel RNA sensing techniques (e.g., SHERLOCK, DETECTR, and Toehold Switch) are promising due to their relatively low cost, high accuracy, and rapid detection time. Diagnostic testing results for SARS-CoV-2 should be interpreted with caution, since they depend heavily on factors such as viral load, virus replication, the source and timing of sample collection, sample extraction, and characteristics of various testing methods.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33244462/,An Update on Molecular Diagnostics for COVID-19,"A novel strain of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) has been recently identified as an infectious disease affecting the respiratory system of humans. This disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2 that was identified in Chinese patients having severe pneumonia and flu-like symptoms. COVID-19 is a contagious disease that spreads rapidly via droplet particles arising through sneezing and coughing action of an infected person. The reports of asymptomatic carriers changed the scenario of symptom based-diagnosis in COVID-19 and intensified the need for proper diagnosis of the majority of the population to combat the rapid transmission of virus. The diagnosis of positive cases is necessary to ensure prompt care to affected people and also to curb further spread of infection in the population. Collecting samples at the right time and from the exact anatomical site is crucial for proper molecular diagnosis. After the complete genome sequence was available, China formulated RT-PCR as a primary diagnostic procedure for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Many in-house and commercial diagnostic kits have been developed or are under development that have a potential to lower the burden of diagnosis on the primary diagnostic techniques like RT-PCR. Serological based diagnosis is another broad category of testing that can detect different serum antibodies like IgG, IgM, and IgA in an infected patient. PCR-based diagnostic procedures that are commonly used for pathogen detection need sophisticated machines and assistance of a technical expert. Despite their reliable accuracy, they are not cost-effective tests, which a common man can afford, so it becomes imperative to look for other diagnostic approaches, which could be cost effective, rapid, and sensitive with consistent accuracy. To make such diagnostics available to the common man, many techniques can be exploited among, which are Point of Care (POC), also known as bed side testing, which is developing as a portable and promising tool in pathogen diagnosis. Other lateral flow assay (LFA)-based techniques like SHERLOCK, CRISPR-Cas12a (AIOD-CRISPR), and FNCAS9 editor-limited uniform detection assay (FELUDA), etc. have shown promising results in rapid detection of pathogens. Diagnosis holds a critical importance in the pandemic situation when there is no potential drug for the pathogen available in the market. This review sums up the different diagnostic approaches designed or proposed to combat the crisis of widespread diagnosis due to the sudden outbreak of a novel pathogen, SARS-CoV-2 in 2019.",COVID-19; CRISPR-Cas12a; SHERLOCK; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; diagnostics; reverse transcription-PCR.,Khursheed Ul Islam;Jawed Iqbal

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33070578/,Recommendations for use of antigenic tests in the diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in the second pandemic wave: attitude in different clinical settings,"The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 before and shortly after the onset of symptoms suggests that only diagnosing and isolating symptomatic patients may not be sufficient to interrupt the spread of infection; therefore, public health measures such as personal distancing are also necessary. Additionally, it will be important to detect the newly infected individuals who remain asymptomatic, which may account for 50% or more of the cases. Molecular techniques are the ""gold standard"" for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the massive use of these techniques has generated some problems. On the one hand, the scarcity of resources (analyzers, fungibles and reagents), and on the other the delay in the notification of results. These two facts translate into a lag in the application of isolation measures among cases and contacts, which favors the spread of the infection. Antigen detection tests are also direct diagnostic methods, with the advantage of obtaining the result in a few minutes and at the very ""pointof-care"". Furthermore, the simplicity and low cost of these tests allow them to be repeated on successive days in certain clinical settings. The sensitivity of antigen tests is generally lower than that of nucleic acid tests, although their specificity is comparable. Antigenic tests have been shown to be more valid in the days around the onset of symptoms, when the viral load in the nasopharynx is higher. Having a rapid and real-time viral detection assay such as the antigen test has been shown to be more useful to control the spread of the infection than more sensitive tests, but with greater cost and response time, such as in case of molecular tests. The main health institutions such as the WHO, the CDC and the Ministry of Health of the Government of Spain propose the use of antigenic tests in a wide variety of strategies to respond to the pandemic. This document aims to support physicians involved in the care of patients with suspected SC2 infection, in the context of a growing incidence in Spain since September 2020, which already represents the second pandemic wave of COVID-19.",COVID-19; PCR; SARS-CoV2; antigenic test; diagnosis; emergency departments; microbiology; nursing home and long-term facilities; pediatrics; primary care.,F J Candel;P Barreiro;J San Román;J C Abanades;R Barba;J Barberán;C Bibiano;J Canora;R Cantón;C Calvo;M Carretero;F Cava;R Delgado;J García-Rodríguez;J González Del Castillo;C González de Villaumbrosia;M Hernández;J E Losa;F J Martínez-Peromingo;J M Molero;P Muñoz;E Onecha;M Onoda;J Rodríguez;M Sánchez-Celaya;J A Serra;A Zapatero

However, considerable improvements to these tests are needed, especially in the detection sensitivity. In this study, six recombinant nucleocapsid and spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were prepared and evaluated, including three prokaryotic expression nucleocapsid proteins (rN, rN1, rN2) and three eukaryotic expression spike proteins (rS1, rS-RBD, rS-RBD-mFc). The recombinant proteins with the highest ELISA titers (rS1 and rS-RBD-mFc) were selected to develop a double-antigen sandwich colloidal gold immunochromatography assay (GICA) to detect total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The clinical evaluation results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of GICA were 92.09% (419/455) and 99.44% (706/710), respectively. Moreover, a significant number (65.63%, 21/32) of COVID-19 patients with undetectable viral RNA were correctly diagnosed by the GICA method. In conclusion, the eukaryotic expression spike proteins (rS1 and rS-RBD-mFc) are more suitable than the prokaryotic expression nucleocapsid proteins for serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.

Particularly, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the quantitative variant (qRT-PCR) have been the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, faster antigen tests and other point-of-care (POC) devices have also played a significant role in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by facilitating mass screening and delivering results in less time. Thus, despite the higher sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR assays, the impact of POC tests cannot be ignored. As a consequence, there has been an increased interest in the development of miniaturized, high-throughput, and automated PCR systems, many of which can be used at point-of-care. This review summarizes the recent advances in the development of miniaturized PCR systems with an emphasis on COVID-19 detection.

The current lack of effective vaccines and treatments places tremendous value on widespread screening, early detection, and contact tracing of COVID-19 for controlling its spread and minimizing the resultant health and societal impact. Bioanalytical diagnostic technologies have played a critical role in the mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to be foundational in the prevention of the subsequent waves of this pandemic along with future infectious disease outbreaks. In this Review, we aim at presenting a roadmap to the bioanalytical testing of COVID-19, with a focus on the performance metrics as well as the limitations of various techniques. The state-of-the-art technologies, mostly limited to centralized laboratories, set the clinical metrics against which the emerging technologies are measured. Technologies for point-of-care and do-it-yourself testing are rapidly emerging, which open the route for testing in the community, at home, and at points-of-entry to widely screen and monitor individuals for enabling normal life despite of an infectious disease pandemic.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission chain is interrupted when screening and diagnosis can be performed on a large scale by identifying asymptomatic or moderately symptomatic patients. Diagnosis of COVID-19 with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been limited due to inadequate access to complex, expensive equipment and reagents, which has impeded efforts to reduce the spread of virus transmission. Recently, the development of several diagnostic platforms based on the CRISPR-Cas system has reduced the dependence on RT-PCR. The first CRISPR-based diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The biosensing systems have several important features that make them suitable for point-of-care tests, including the speed of design and synthesis of each platform in less than a few days, an assay time of 1-2 h, and the cost of materials and reagents less than one dollar per test. The HUDSON-SHERLOCK and STOPCovid biosensing systems, as field-deployable and rapid diagnostic tests, can detect low-copy viruses in body fluids without nucleic acid extraction and with minimal equipment. In addition, Cas13-based treatment strategies could potentially be an effective antiviral strategy for the prevention and treatment of emerging pandemic viruses such as SARS-CoV-2.

COVID-19 leads to a mild to severe respiratory disease and affects different organs and has become a global concern since December 2019. Meanwhile, molecular biology and diagnostic laboratories played an essential role in diagnosis of the disease by introducing serological and molecular tests. Molecular-based techniques are reliable detection tools for SARS-CoV-2 and used for diagnosis of patients especially in the early stage of the disease. While, serological assays are considered as additional tools to verify the asymptomatic infections, tracing previous contacts of individuals, vaccine efficacy, and study the seroprevalance. The average time of the appearance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the patient's serum is 3-6 days after the onset of symptoms for both IgM and IgA and 10-18 days for IgG. Following the outbreak of COVID-19, FDA has approved and authorized a series of serological laboratory tests for early diagnosis. Serological assays have low-cost and provide fast results but have poor sensitivity in the early stage of the viral infection.

Antibody testing, both at an individual level and of populations, has been widely viewed to be a key activity for guiding the options for treatment of high-risk individuals, as well as the implementation of safe control of infection measures. Ideally, the detection of a specific antibody should signify that all individuals tested have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and that in the case of specific IgG that they are immune to further infection. This would enable SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals to be appropriately managed and healthcare workers shown to be immune to return to work where they would no longer pose a risk to their patients or be at risk themselves. Unfortunately, this is not the case for COVID-19, where it has been shown that immunity may not be protective, and seroconversion delayed or absent. The variability in antibody test performance, particularly that of lateral flow assays, has caused confusion for the public and healthcare professions alike.

Four SARS-CoV-2 infected deceased patients were subjected to medicolegal autopsy. Post mortem intervals (PMI) of 1, 4, 9 and 17 days, respectively, were documented. During autopsy, swabs and organ samples were taken and examined by RT-qPCR (real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA).

We ultimately found that computed tomography was associated with a higher rate of diagnostic accuracy than was a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based approach (P = .0041), and chest radiography (P = .0100). Even so, it is important that clinicians utilize a combination of laboratory and radiological testing where possible to ensure that this virus is reliably and quickly detected such that it may be treated and patients may be isolated in a timely fashion, thereby effectively curbing the further progression of this pandemic.",chest radiography; computed tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; coronavirus pneumonia; diagnosis; polymerase chain reaction.,Zhong Zheng;Zhixian Yao;Ke Wu;Junhua Zheng
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34426120/,Current scenario of COVID-19 vaccinations and immune response along with antibody titer in vaccinated inhabitants of different countries,"The COVID-19 pandemic challenges have been only partially addressed so far. The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is considered the combination of severe and high infectivity. Herdimmunity is attained when a critical proportion of the population is immune, providing the virus with fewer chances to spread locally. To overcome the rising tide of the COVID-19 pandemic, efficacious and safe vaccines providing defensive and long-lasting immunity responses are urgently needed.Vaccines that induce virus-neutralizing antibodies with great affinity can optimally fight against infection. Worldwide, over 120 novel vaccine candidates, including live-attenuated, inactivated, viral-vectored nonreplicating and replicating, peptide- and protein-based, and nucleic acid-based approaches are in the process of preclinical and clinical trials (phase 1-4). In addition to comprehensive safety assessments and immune responses, precise clinical management is also important for trials of vaccines. The recent emergence of different variants of SARS-CoV-2 is becoming a new threat for the world and a challenge for scientists to introduce the most influential vaccine against COVID-19. The possibility of natural and vaccine-induced immunity in variants finds it necessary to establish next-generation vaccines, which generate general neutralization against existing and future variants. Here, we summarize the cellular and humoral responses of SARS-CoV-2, current progress in vaccination development, the antibody titer response of available phase 4 vaccinations in vaccinated populations of different countries worldwide, and the success and challenges ahead of vaccine development.",Adaptive immunity; Antibody titer; COVID-19; Cellular immunity; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-CoV-2 variants; Vaccination.,Asim Hussain;Hamza Rafeeq;Hafiza Memoona Asif;Sumaira Shabbir;Muhammad Bilal;Sikandar I Mulla;Marcelo Franco;Hafiz M N Iqbal

The quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, more and more infected patients are relapsing after discharge, which suggests qPCR may fail to detect the virus in some cases. In this study, we selected 74 clinical samples from 43 recovering inpatients for qPCR and Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) synchronous blind detection, and established a cutoff value for ddPCR diagnosis of COVID-19. The results showed that at a cutoff value of 0.04 copies/μL, the ddPCR sensitivity and specificity are 97.6% and 100%, respectively. In addition, we also analyzed 18 retained samples from 9 discharged patients who relapsed. Although qPCR showed all 18 samples to be negative, ddPCR showed 12 to be positive, and there was only one patient with two negative samples; the other eight patients had at least one positive sample. These results indicate that ddPCR could significantly improve the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis, especially for discharged patients with a low viral load, and help to reduce misdiagnosis during recovery.",COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; discharged criteria; droplet digital PCR.,Chong Liu;Qingxin Shi;Mingfei Peng;Ruyue Lu;Haohao Li;Yingying Cai;Jiaxi Chen;Jiaqin Xu;Bo Shen

Asymptomatic subjects carrying SARS-CoV-2 often remain undiagnosed and it is still debated whether they develop immunoglobulins (Ig) and how long they persist. The aim of this study was to investigate the development and persistence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic subjects infected by the virus. This follow-up study was performed on the 31 asymptomatic subjects who presented a positive nasal swab or serology against SARS-CoV-2 (Ig against Spike-RBD) in the first part of the UNICORN study (March 2020) aimed at attesting previous or current contacts with the virus in the personnel of the University of Milan. Eight weeks after the first Ig measure, these subjects were invited to donate a second blood sample for testing serum antibodies (IgM, IgG and total antibodies) and to fill-in a structured questionnaire. About 80% of asymptomatic subjects did not present circulating immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2 after 8 weeks from a positive nasal swab against the virus. Moreover, in more than 40% of these subjects, no Ig against SARS-CoV-2 were detected at any time. Finally, about two third of subjects with immunoglobulins at baseline did not present IgG against SARS-CoV-2 after 8 weeks. The majority of subjects who developed an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection do not present antibodies against the RBD-spike protein after 8 weeks of follow-up.

Molecular tests are the current gold standard for COVID-19 detection, but are carried out at central laboratories, delaying treatment and control decisions. Here we describe a portable assay system for rapid, onsite COVID-19 diagnosis. Termed CODA (CRISPR Optical Detection of Anisotropy), the method combined isothermal nucleic acid amplification, activation of CRISPR/Cas12a, and signal generation in a single assay, eliminating extra manual steps. Importantly, signal detection was based on the ratiometric measurement of fluorescent anisotropy, which allowed CODA to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio. For point-of-care operation, we built a compact, standalone CODA device integrating optoelectronics, an embedded heater, and a microcontroller for data processing. The developed system completed SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection within 20 min of sample loading; the limit of detection reached 3 copy/μL.

The COVID-19 pandemic was heralded by the 2003 SARS epidemic which led to the discovery of human and civet SARS-CoV-1, bat SARS-related-CoVs, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related bat CoV HKU4 and HKU5, and other novel animal coronaviruses. The suspected animal-to-human jumping of 4 betacoronaviruses including the human coronaviruses OC43(1890), SARS-CoV-1(2003), MERS-CoV(2012), and SARS-CoV-2(2019) indicates their significant pandemic potential. The presence of a large reservoir of coronaviruses in bats and other wild mammals, culture of mixing and selling them in urban markets with suboptimal hygiene, habit of eating exotic mammals in highly populated areas, and the rapid and frequent air travels from these areas are perfect ingredients for brewing rapidly exploding epidemics. The possibility of emergence of a hypothetical SARS-CoV-3 or other novel viruses from animals or laboratories, and therefore needs for global preparedness should not be ignored.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was made by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data and laboratory test reports of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who received a convalescent plasma transfusion. RESULTS A total of 24 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were transfused with ABO-compatible convalescent plasma were enrolled in the study. Convalescent plasma transfusion showed an effective clinical outcome in 14 of 24 patients (an effective rate of 58.3%). No patients had an adverse reaction to the transfusion. Compared with before convalescent plasma transfusion, the lymphocyte count after convalescent plasma transfusion increased to a normal level (median: 0.80×10⁹/L vs. 1.12×10⁹/L, P=0.004). Other laboratory indicators such as white blood cells, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate transaminase showed a decreasing trend after transfusion. CONCLUSIONS This retrospective observational clinical study showed that convalescent plasma therapy could have beneficial effects on patient outcomes.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33439160/,Rapid molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 by RT-LAMP in a centrifugal polystyrene-toner based microdevice with end-point visual detection,"Infection caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become a serious worldwide public health problem, and one of the most important strategies for its control is mass testing. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has emerged as an important alternative to simplify the diagnostics of infectious diseases. In addition, an advantage of LAMP is that it allows for easy reading of the final result through visual detection. However, this step must be performed with caution to avoid contamination and false-positive results. LAMP performed on microfluidic platforms can minimize false-positive results, in addition to having potential for point-of-care applications. Here, we describe a polystyrene-toner (PS-T) centrifugal microfluidic device manually controlled by a fidget spinner for molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 by RT-LAMP, with integrated and automated colorimetric detection. The amplification was carried out in a microchamber with 5 μL capacity, and the reaction was thermally controlled with a thermoblock at 72 °C for 10 min. At the end of the incubation time, the detection of amplified RT-LAMP fragments was performed directly on the chip by automated visual detection. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to detect COVID-19 in reactions initiated with approximately 10-3 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Clinical samples were tested using our RT-LAMP protocol as well as by conventional RT-qPCR, demonstrating comparable performance to the CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33980687/,Tools and Techniques for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)/COVID-19 Detection,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to millions of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide. Efficient diagnostic tools are in high demand, as rapid and large-scale testing plays a pivotal role in patient management and decelerating disease spread. This paper reviews current technologies used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical laboratories as well as advances made for molecular, antigen-based, and immunological point-of-care testing, including recent developments in sensor and biosensor devices. The importance of the timing and type of specimen collection is discussed, along with factors such as disease prevalence, setting, and methods. Details of the mechanisms of action of the various methodologies are presented, along with their application span and known performance characteristics. Diagnostic imaging techniques and biomarkers are also covered, with an emphasis on their use for assessing COVID-19 or monitoring disease severity or complications. While the SARS-CoV-2 literature is rapidly evolving, this review highlights topics of interest that have occurred during the pandemic and the lessons learned throughout. Exploring a broad armamentarium of techniques for detecting SARS-CoV-2 will ensure continued diagnostic support for clinicians, public health, and infection prevention and control for this pandemic and provide advice for future pandemic preparedness.",2019-nCoV; COVID-19; NAAT; PCR; SARS-CoV-2; antigen; biomarkers; coronavirus; next-generation sequencing; serology.,Seyed Hamid Safiabadi Tali;Jason J LeBlanc;Zubi Sadiq;Oyejide Damilola Oyewunmi;Carolina Camargo;Bahareh Nikpour;Narges Armanfard;Selena M Sagan;Sana Jahanshahi-Anbuhi

Based on the cross-classified results of RT-PCR and LFIA, we used Bayesian latent-class models, which do not require a gold standard for the evaluation of diagnostics. Data were extracted from studies that evaluated LFIA (immunoglobulin G (IgG) and/or immunoglobulin M (IgM)) assays using RT-PCR as the reference method. The sensitivity of RT-PCR was 0.68 (95% probability interval (PrI): 0.63, 0.73). IgG/M sensitivity was 0.32 (95% PrI :0.23; 0.41) for the first week and increased steadily. It was 0.75 (95% PrI: 0.67; 0.83) and 0.93 (95% PrI: 0.88; 0.97) for the second and third weeks after symptom onset, respectively. Both tests had a high to absolute specificity, with higher point median estimates for RT-PCR specificity and narrower probability intervals. The specificity of RT-PCR was 0.99 (95% PrI: 0.98; 1.00). and the specificity of IgG/IgM was 0.97 (95% PrI: 0.92, 1.00), 0.98 (95% PrI: 0.95, 1.00) and 0.98 (95% PrI: 0.94, 1.00) for the first, second, and third weeks after symptom onset.

We identified panels of fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from large phage-displayed Fab, scFv, and VH libraries by panning against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein. A high-affinity Fab was selected from one of the libraries and converted to a full-size antibody, IgG1 ab1, which competed with human ACE2 for binding to RBD. It potently neutralized replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 but not SARS-CoV, as measured by two different tissue culture assays, as well as a replication-competent mouse ACE2-adapted SARS-CoV-2 in BALB/c mice and native virus in hACE2-expressing transgenic mice showing activity at the lowest tested dose of 2 mg/kg. IgG1 ab1 also exhibited high prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mechanism of neutralization is by competition with ACE2 but could involve antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) as IgG1 ab1 had ADCC activity in vitro. The ab1 sequence has a relatively low number of somatic mutations, indicating that ab1-like antibodies could be quickly elicited during natural SARS-CoV-2 infection or by RBD-based vaccines. IgG1 ab1 did not aggregate, did not exhibit other developability liabilities, and did not bind to any of the 5,300 human membrane-associated proteins tested. These results suggest that IgG1 ab1 has potential for therapy and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The rapid identification (within 6 d of availability of antigen for panning) of potent mAbs shows the value of large antibody libraries for response to public health threats from emerging microbes.",SARS-CoV-2; animal models; coronaviruses; therapeutic antibodies.,Wei Li;Chuan Chen;Aleksandra Drelich;David R Martinez;Lisa E Gralinski;Zehua Sun;Alexandra Schäfer;Swarali S Kulkarni;Xianglei Liu;Sarah R Leist;Doncho V Zhelev;Liyong Zhang;Ye-Jin Kim;Eric C Peterson;Alex Conard;John W Mellors;Chien-Te K Tseng;Darryl Falzarano;Ralph S Baric;Dimiter S Dimitrov

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33622845/,Interpreting COVID-19 Test Results in Clinical Settings: It Depends!,"Tests for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are intended for a disparate and shifting range of purposes: (1) diagnosing patients who present with symptoms to inform individual treatment decisions; (2) organizational uses such as ""cohorting"" potentially infected patients and staff to protect others; and (3) contact tracing, surveillance, and other public health purposes. Often lost when testing is encouraged is that testing does not by itself confer health benefits. Rather, testing is useful to the extent it forms a critical link to subsequent medical or public health interventions. Such interventions might be individual level, like better diagnosis, treatment, isolation, or quarantine of contacts. They might aid surveillance to understand levels and trends of disease within a defined population that enables informed decisions to implement or relax social distancing measures. In this article, we describe the range of available COVID-19 tests; their accuracy and timing considerations; and the specific clinical, organizational, and public health considerations that warrant different testing strategies. Three representative clinical scenarios illustrate the importance of appropriate test use and interpretation. The reason a patient seeks testing is often a strong indicator of the pretest probability of infection, and thus how to interpret test results. In addition, the level of population spread of the virus and the timing of testing play critical roles in the positive or negative predictive value of the test. We conclude with practical recommendations regarding the need for testing in various contexts, appropriate tests and testing methods, and the interpretation of test results.",COVID-19; Clinical Decision-Making; Contact Tracing; Evidence-Based Medicine; Population Health; Probability; Public Health; Sensitivity and Specificity.,Rachael Piltch-Loeb;Kyeong Yun Jeong;Kenneth W Lin;John Kraemer;Michael A Stoto

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33527470/,Using COVID-19 cycle threshold and other lab values as predictors of hospitalization need,"SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) is a novel virus that has caused over 28 million cases worldwide and over 900,000 deaths since early 2020, rightfully being classified as a pandemic. COVID-19 is diagnosed via polymerase chain reaction testing which looks at cycle threshold (CT) values of two genes, N2 and E. This study examined CT values of COVID-positive patients at the VA hospital in Reno as well as other lab values and comorbidities to determine if any could aid clinicians in predicting the need for hospitalization and higher levels of care. Multiple variables, including N2 CT value, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), D-dimer, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and ferritin were evaluated for potential associations with N2 CT value as well as required level of care (based on World Health Organization [WHO] ordinal score). The results suggest that patients with a N2 CT value less than 34 are four times more likely to have WHO ordinal scores of 4-8 (p = .0021) while controlling for age and comorbidities (DM, cardiac, kidney, and lung disease). Patients of age 55 or greater were 15.18 times more likely to have WHO ordinal scores of 4-8 (p = .012) controlling for N2 CT value and comorbidities. Furthermore, patients with ALC less than 1 were 5.88 times more likely to have WHO ordinal score of 4-8 (p = .00024). N2 CT values also appear to be associated with many commonly obtained markers such as ALC, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer. Patients with N2 CT values less than 34 were 3.49 times more likely to have ALC values less than 1, controlling for age and comorbidities (p = .0072) while patients 55 or older were 6.66 times more likely to have ALC less than 1 (p = .027). Finally, this study confirms previous conclusions that patients with advanced age had more severe infections and thus will likely require higher levels of care.",coronavirus; infection; pandemic; replication; spread.,Ramamahesh Seeni;Tarek Firzli;Mark S Riddle;Charles Krasner;Sara Ashraf;Faisal Siddiqui

Actions are being implemented to keep health care systems from being overstretched and to curb the outbreak. Any policy responses aimed at slowing down the spread of the virus and mitigating its immediate effects on health care systems require a firm basis of information about the absolute number of currently infected people, growth rates, and locations/hotspots of infections. The only way to obtain this base of information is by conducting numerous tests in a targeted way. Currently, in Ghana, there is a centralized testing approach, that takes 4-5 days for samples to be shipped and tested at central reference laboratories with results communicated to the district, regional and national stakeholders. This delay in diagnosis increases the risk of ongoing transmission in communities and vulnerable institutions. We have validated, evaluated and deployed an innovative diagnostic tool on a mobile laboratory platform to accelerate the COVID-19 testing.

However, routine diagnosis by RT-qPCR is a limitation for many laboratories, mainly due to the infrastructure and/or disproportionate relationship between demand and supply of inputs. In this context, and to increase the diagnostic coverage of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we describe an alternative, sensitive and specific one-step end-point RT-PCR for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene. The performance of the RT-PCR was evaluated in 43 clinical samples, of which 10 and 33 were previously identified as negative and positive, respectively, by RT-qPCR. Among the positive samples, 15 and 18 were from asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, respectively. Here, 32/33 of the positive samples in the RT-qPCR, including from asymptomatic individuals, were found positive in the RT-PCR (Ct 15.94-34.92). The analytical sensitivity of the assay was about 7.15-9 copies of vRNA/μL, and nonspecific amplifications were not observed in SARS-CoV-2 negative samples. Importantly, the RT-PCR reactions were performed in a 10 μL final volume.

Samples were collected in a drive-through car line for symptomatic individuals (n = 380) and in the emergency department (ED) (n = 69). The percentages of positive and negative agreement of saliva compared to nasopharyngeal swab were 81.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.8% to 90.5%) and 99.8% (95% CI, 98.7% to 100%), respectively. The percent positive agreement increased to 90.0% (95% CI, 74.4% to 96.5%) when considering only samples with moderate to high viral load (cycle threshold [CT ] for the NP, ≤34). Pools of five saliva specimens were also evaluated on three platforms, bioMérieux NucliSENS easyMAG with ABI 7500Fast (CDC assay), Hologic Panther Fusion, and Roche Cobas 6800.

A baseline serological survey of COVID-19 antibodies is essential to accurately evaluate an epidemic outbreak. The primary purpose of this study was to determine pre-epidemic prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies among healthcare workers, using two laboratory-based quantitative tests. In addition, a point-of-care (POC) qualitative test, rapid, simple, and convenient for primary care clinics, was compared with the laboratory-based tests. All antibody tests were performed on serum from 1,000 healthcare workers (mean age, 40 ± 11 years) in Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital, May 29-31, 2020. A COVID-19 case was defined as showing positive results in both laboratory-based quantitative tests. None of 1,000 samples had positive results in both of the laboratory immunoassays. The POC test showed positive results in 33 of 1,000 samples (3.3%) (95% confidence interval:2.19-4.41), but no samples were simultaneously positive in both laboratory-based tests. In conclusion, COVID-19 cases were not serologically confirmed by a baseline control study of healthcare workers at our hospital in late May, 2020. Moreover, the POC qualitative test may offer no advantage in areas with very low prevalence of COVID-19, due to higher false-positive reactions compared with laboratory-based quantitative immunoassays.",COVID-19; Iwate; SARS-CoV-2; antibody test; seroprevalence.,Akihiro Nakamura;Ryoichi Sato;Sanae Ando;Natsuko Oana;Eiji Nozaki;Hideaki Endo;Yoshiharu Miyate;Jun Soma;Go Miyata

Point-of-care antigen tests (POCT) may provide an alternative to time-consuming PCR tests to rapidly screen for acute infections on site. Here, we evaluated two SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests: the STANDARD™ F COVID-19 Ag FIA (FIA) and the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (RAT). For diagnostic assessment, we used a large set of PCR-positive and PCR-negative respiratory swabs from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients and health care workers in the setting of two University Hospitals in Munich, Germany, i.e. emergency rooms, patient care units or employee test centers. For FIA, overall clinical sensitivity and specificity were 45.4% (n = 381) and 97.8% (n = 360), respectively, and for RAT, 50.3% (n = 445) and 97.7% (n = 386), respectively.

Rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 is vital to control the spreading of the disease, which, however, is challenged by limited detection capacity and low detection efficiency in many parts of the world. The pooling test may offer an economical and effective approach to increase the virus testing capacity of medical laboratories without requiring more laboratory resources such as laboratory workers, testing reagents, and equipment. In this study, the sample pools of 6 and 10 were detected by a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay targeting ORF1ab and N genes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Each pool consisted of five or nine negative SARS-CoV-2 samples and one positive counterpart with varying viral loads. Two different strategies of sample pooling were investigated and the results were compared comprehensively. One approach was to pool the viral transport medium of the samples in the laboratory, and the other was to pool swab samples during the collection process. For swab pooling strategy, qualitative results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, specific tests of ORF1ab and N genes, remained stable over the different pool sizes. Together, this study demonstrates that the swab pooling strategy may serve as an effective and economical approach for screening SARS-CoV-2 infections in large populations, especially in countries and regions where medical resources are limited during the pandemic and may thus be potential for clinical laboratory applications.",COVID-19; RT-PCR test; SARS-CoV-2; sample pooling strategy.,Fenghua Chen;Zhi Geng;Jian Wang;Wenbo Liuchang;Da Huang;Yuandong Xu;Zheng Wang;Lin Wang

Here, we report a stepwise protocol for an RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test for rapid and naked-eye molecular diagnosis of COVID-19. The test employs a unique dual-prong approach that integrates nucleic acid (NA) amplification and plasmonic sensing for point-of-care detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with a sample-to-assay response time of <1 h. The RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test utilizes plasmonic gold nanoparticles capped with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) as a colorimetric reporter to detect the amplified nucleic acid from the COVID-19 causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. The ASOs are specific for the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene, and binding of the ASOs to their target sequence results in the aggregation of the plasmonic gold nanoparticles. This highly specific agglomeration step leads to a change in the plasmonic response of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, when tested using clinical samples, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the test were found to be >98.4%, >96.6% and 100%, respectively, with a detection limit of 10 copies/μL. The test can easily be adapted to diagnose other viral infections with a simple modification of the ASOs and primer sequences. It also provides a low-cost, rapid approach requiring minimal instrumentation that can be used as a screening tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 at point-of-care settings in resource-poor situations. The colorimetric readout of the test can even be monitored using a handheld optical reader to obtain a quantitative response. Therefore, we anticipate that this protocol will be widely useful for the development of biosensors for the molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.",,Maha Alafeef;Parikshit Moitra;Ketan Dighe;Dipanjan Pan

Real-time massive SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing is key to tracking chains of transmission and estimating the origin of disease outbreaks. Yet no methods have simultaneously achieved high precision, simple workflow, and low cost. We developed a high-precision, cost-efficient SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing platform for COVID-19 genomic surveillance, CorvGenSurv (Coronavirus Genomic Surveillance). CorvGenSurv directly amplified viral RNA from COVID-19 patients' Nasopharyngeal/Oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swab specimens and sequenced the SARS-CoV-2 whole genome in three segments by long-read, high-throughput sequencing. Sequencing of the whole genome in three segments significantly reduced sequencing data waste, thereby preventing dropouts in genome coverage. We validated the precision of our pipeline by both control genomic RNA sequencing and Sanger sequencing. We produced near full-length whole genome sequences from individuals who were COVID-19 test positive during April to June 2020 in Los Angeles County, California, USA. These sequences were highly diverse in the G clade with nine novel amino acid mutations including NSP12-M755I and ORF8-V117F.

Here, we report the dynamic changes of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens in nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients and its association with the viral nucleic acid clearance and clinical outcomes. Eighty-five COVID-19 patients were enrolled for detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens, including 57 anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative cases and 28 antibody positive cases. The viral antigen could be detected in 52.63% (30/57) patients with SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the first 5 days after disease onset (p = 0.0018) and disappeared in about 8 days after disease onset. Viral antigens were highly detectable in patients with low Ct value (less than 30) of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCT assay, suggesting the expression of viral antigen was associated with high viral load. Furthermore, positive antigen detection indicated disease progression, nine cases with positive antigen (9/30, 30.0%), in contrast to two cases (2/27, 7.40%) (p = 0.0444) with negative antigen, which progressed into severe disease.

The cluster was identified while investigating a weak positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that was returned by a male in his 60s in September 2020. The PCR result, combined with a clear clinical and epidemiological history of a COVID-19 like illness in late February 2020, prompted serological testing. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected and supported historical infection. Serology was also reactive for five close contacts who had also experienced a COVID-19 like illness in February 2020. Combined case histories and investigations suggest that this local cluster was import related, with the index case identified as a family member visiting from Italy in February. Case investigation also suggests this cluster was active in New Zealand prior to any previously documented local cases, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 was present and local transmission was occurring earlier than initially suspected. A weak positive PCR result, six months after acute infection, supports international evidence that SARS-CoV-2 genetic material can be detected for several months after initial COVID-19 infection, and that this is not necessarily indicative of infectivity.",,Elizabeth Becker;Richard Vipond;Chris Mansell

A recently developed field-deployable clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) detection assay with lateral flow strips shows promise for point-of-care detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, the limit of detection of paper strip-based assays (10-100 copies/μL) is much lower than that of fluorescence-based detection methods. In this study, we developed an easy-readout and sensitive enhanced (ERASE) strip to visualize the results of CRISPR detection and improve the sensitivity to 1 copy/μL with an unambiguous easy-read result. Using 649 clinical samples from blind specimens collected from patients in China, we validated our ERASE assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection with 90.67% positive predictive agreement and 99.21% negative predictive agreement.

Using a new machine learning algorithm developed by us, we have reported a significantly higher number of predicted COVID-19 cases than the documented counts across the world. The sole reliance on confirmed symptomatic cases overlooking the symptomless COVID-19 infections and the dynamics of waning immunity may not provide 'true' spectrum of infection proportion, a key element for an effective planning and implementation of protection and prevention strategies. We and others have previously shown that strategic orthogonal testing and leveraging systematic data-driven modeling approach to account for asymptomatics and waning cases may situationally have a compelling role in informing efficient vaccination strategies beyond prevalence reporting. However, currently Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend serological testing either before or after vaccination to assess immune status. Given the 27% occurrence of breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated (FV) group with many being asymptomatics and still a larger fraction of the general mass remaining unvaccinated, the relaxed mask mandate and distancing by CDC can drive resurgence. Thus, we believe it is a key time to focus on asymptomatics (no symptoms) and oligosymptomatics (so mild that the symptoms remain unrecognized) as they can be silent reservoirs to propagate the infection. This perspective thus highlights the need for proactive efforts to reevaluate the current variables/strategies in accounting for symptomless and waning fractions.",COVID-19; asymptomatic; serology testing; vaccination; waning.,Madhusudhanan Narasimhan;Lenin Mahimainathan;Jungsik Noh;Alagarraju Muthukumar

Delay in diagnosis has facilitated the rapid spread of this novel virus throughout the world resulting in global mortality that will surpass 2.5 million people. Development of point-of-care diagnostic assays that can be performed in rural or decentralized health care centers to expand testing capacity is needed. We developed a qualitative test based on recombinase-polymerase-amplification coupled with lateral flow reading (RPA-LF) for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. The RPA-LF detected SARS-CoV-2 with a limit of detection of 35.4 viral cDNA nucleocapsid (N) gene copies/μL. Additionally, the RPA-LF was able to detect 0.25-2.5 copies/μL of SARS-CoV-2 N gene containing plasmid.

With the vaccine trials still in clinical phases, mitigation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) relies primarily on robust virus detection methods and subsequent quarantine measures. Hence, the importance of rapid, affordable and reproducible virus testing will serve the need to identify and treat infected subjects in a timely manner. Based on the type of diagnostic assay, the primary targets are viral genome (RNA) and encoded proteins. Currently, COVID-19 detection is performed using various molecular platforms as well as serodiagnostics that exhibit approximately 71% sensitivity. These methods encounter several limitations including sensitivity, specificity, availability of skilled expertise and instrument access. Saliva-based COVID-19 diagnostics are emerging as a superior alternative to nasal swabs because of the ease of sample collection, no interaction during sampling, and high viral titers during early stages of infection. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is detected in the environment as aerosols associated with suspended particulate matter. Designing virus detection strategies in diverse samples will allow timely monitoring of virus spread in humans and its persistence in the environment.

Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was one of the most quickly established methods of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection and is considered to be the gold standard. In this report, we share our experience of using two different testing platforms: the cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 test, an automated system that was recently granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA, and a laboratory-developed test based on the protocol from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC). There was an overall 96.2% agreement between the two platforms. However, the positive agreement between the two platforms was only 80.0%.

The primary detection technique for SARS-CoV-2, the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based approach, requires expensive reagents and equipment and skilled personnel. In addition, for SARS-CoV-2 detection, specimens are usually shipped to a designated laboratory for testing, which may extend the diagnosis and treatment time of patients with COVID-19. The latest research shows that clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based approaches can quickly provide visual, rapid, ultrasensitive, and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 at isothermal conditions. Therefore, CRISPR-based approaches are expected to be developed as attractive alternatives to conventional RT-PCR methods for the efficient and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2. Recent advances in the field of CRISPR-based biosensing technologies for SARS-CoV-2 detection and insights into their potential use in many applications are reviewed in this article.",2019-nCoV; COVID-19; CRISPR; SARS-CoV-2; diagnosis.,Wancun Zhang;Kangbo Liu;Pin Zhang;Weyland Cheng;Linfei Li;Fan Zhang;Zhidan Yu;Lifeng Li;Xianwei Zhang

Viral genomes can provide key insights into transmission chains and pathogenicity. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from thirty-two of the first SARS-CoV-2 positive cases (March 18-30) in Kingston Ontario, Canada. Viral genomes were sequenced using Ion Torrent (n = 24) and MinION (n = 27) sequencing platforms. SARS-CoV-2 genomes carried forty-six polymorphic sites including two missense and three synonymous variants in the spike protein gene. The D614G point mutation was the predominate viral strain in our cohort (92.6%). A heterozygous variant (C9994A) was detected by both sequencing platforms but filtered by the ARTIC network bioinformatic pipeline suggesting that heterozygous variants may be underreported in the SARS-CoV-2 literature. Phylogenetic analysis with 87,738 genomes in the GISAID database identified global origins and transmission events including multiple, international introductions as well as community spread. Reported travel history validated viral introduction and transmission inferred by phylogenetic analysis. Molecular epidemiology and evolutionary phylogenetics may complement contact tracing and help reconstruct transmission chains of emerging diseases. Earlier detection and screening in this way could improve the effectiveness of regional public health interventions to limit future pandemics.",,Calvin P Sjaarda;Nazneen Rustom;Gerald A Evans;David Huang;Santiago Perez-Patrigeon;Melissa L Hudson;Henry Wong;Zhengxin Sun;T Hugh Guan;Muhammad Ayub;Claudio N Soares;Robert I Colautti;Prameet M Sheth

To achieve high quality assurance, appropriate positive and negative controls are critical for disease detection using RT-PCR kits. In this study, we have found that commercial kits often adopt DNAs instead of RNAs as the positive controls, which can't report the kit problems in reverse transcription, thereby increasing risk of the false negative results when testing patient samples. To face the challenge, we have proposed and developed the chemically modified RNAs, such as phosphoroselenaote and phosphorothioate RNAs (Se-RNA and S-RNA), as the controls. We have found that while demonstrating the high thermostability, biostability, chemostability and exclusivity (or specificity), both Se-RNA and S-RNA can be fine templates for reverse transcription, indicating their potentials as both positive and negative controls for RT-PCR kits.",COVID-19; DNA- or RNA-Based positive and ngegative controls; Phosphoroselenaote RNA; Phosphorothioate RNA; RT-PCR.,Guangcheng Luo;Jun Zhang;Shun Zhang;Bei Hu;Lillian Hu;Zhen Huang

Real time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) is the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, this resource-intensive and relatively lengthy technique is not ideally suited for mass testing. While pooled testing offers substantial savings in cost and time, the size of the optimum pool that offers complete concordance with results of individualized testing remains elusive. To determine the optimum pool size, we first evaluated the utility of pool testing using simulated 5-sample pools with varying proportions of positive and negative samples. We observed that 5-sample pool testing resulted in false negativity rate of 5% when the pools contained one positive sample. We then examined the diagnostic performance of 4-sample pools in the operational setting of a diagnostic laboratory using 500 consecutive samples in 125 pools. With background prevalence of 2.4%, this 4-sample pool testing showed 100% concordance with individualized testing and resulted in 66% and 59% reduction in resource and turnaround time, respectively. Since the negative predictive value of a diagnostic test varies inversely with prevalence, we re-tested the 4-sample pooling strategy using a fresh batch of 500 samples in 125 pools when the prevalence rose to 12.7% and recorded 100% concordance and reduction in cost and turnaround time by 36% and 30%, respectively.

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been promptly applied to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 owing to its high amplification efficacy and less requirement of the thermal cycler. However, the vast majority of these LAMP-based assays depend on the non-specific detection of LAMP products, which can not discern the undesirable amplificons, likely to yield unreliable results. Herein, a sequence-specific LAMP assay was reported to detect SARS-CoV-2 using proofreading enzyme-mediated probe cleavage (named Proofman), which could realize real-time and visual detection without uncapping. This assay, introducing a proofreading enzyme and the fluorogenic probe to reverse-transcription LAMP (RT-Proofman-LAMP), can specifically detect the SARS-CoV-2 RNA with a detection limit of 100 copies. In addition to the real-time analysis, the assay is capable of endpoint visualization under a transilluminator within 50 min, providing a convenient reporting manner under the setting of point-of-care testing (POCT). In combination with different fluorophores, the one-pot multiplex assay was successfully achieved to detect multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2 and inner control simultaneously.

In this study, four rapid methods (ACE2-RBD inhibition assay, S1-IgG detection, RBD-IgG detection, and N-IgG detection) were established and evaluated based on chemiluminescence technology. For the first time, a broadly neutralizing antibody with high affinity was used as a standard for the quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies in human sera. Sera from COVID-19 convalescent patients (N = 119), vaccinated donors (N = 86), and healthy donors (N = 299) confirmed by microneutralization test (MNT) were used to evaluate the above methods. The result showed that the ACE2-RBD inhibition assay calculated with either ACE2-RBD binding inhibition percentage rate or ACE2-RBD inhibiting antibody concentration were strongly correlated with MNT (r ≥ 0.78, p < 0.0001) and also highly consistent with MNT (Kappa Value ≥ 0.94, p < 0.01). There was also a strong correlation between the two evaluation indices (r ≥ 0.99, p < 0.0001).

Here, we assessed the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related diagnostic workload during the onset of the pandemic in the central laboratory of Benin, Western Africa; characterized 12 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from returning travelers; and validated the Da An RT-PCR-based diagnostic kit that is widely used across Africa. We found a 15-fold increase in the monthly laboratory workload due to COVID-19, dealt with at the cost of routine activities. Genomic surveillance showed near-simultaneous introduction of distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages termed A.4 and B.1, including the D614G spike protein variant potentially associated with higher transmissibility from travelers from six different European and African countries during March-April 2020. We decoded the target regions within the ORF1ab and N genes of the Da An dual-target kit by MinION-based amplicon sequencing. Despite relatively high similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) within the ORF1ab target domain, no cross-detection of high-titered cell culture supernatants of HCoVs was observed, suggesting high analytical specificity. The Da An kit was highly sensitive, detecting 3.2 to 9.0 copies of target-specific in vitro transcripts/reaction. Although discrepant test results were observed in low-titered clinical samples, clinical sensitivity of the Da An kit was at least comparable to that of commercial kits from affluent settings. In sum, virologic diagnostics are achievable in a resource-limited setting, but unprecedented pressure resulting from COVID-19-related diagnostics requires rapid and sustainable support of national and supranational stakeholders addressing limited laboratory capacity.IMPORTANCE Months after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, case numbers from Africa are surprisingly low, potentially because the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests performed in Africa is lower than in other regions. Here, we show an overload of COVID-19-related diagnostics in the central laboratory of Benin, Western Africa, with a stagnating average number of positive samples irrespective of daily sample counts. SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance confirmed a high genomic diversity in Benin introduced by travelers returning from Europe and other African countries, including early circulation of the D614G spike mutation associated with potentially higher transmissibility. We validated a widely used RT-PCR kit donated by the Chinese Jack Ma Foundation and confirmed high analytical specificity and clinical sensitivity equivalent to tests used in affluent settings.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33379092/,Technical considerations to development of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact worldwide and has brought clinical assays both for acute diagnosis and prior exposure determination to the forefront. Serological testing intended for point-of-care or laboratory use can be used to determine more accurate individual and population assessments of prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2; improve our understanding of the degree to which immunity is conveyed to subsequent exposures; and quantify immune response to future vaccines. In response to this pandemic, initially more than 90 companies deployed serology assays to the U.S. market, many of which made overstated claims for their accuracy, regulatory approval status, and utility for intended purpose. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration subsequently instituted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) procedure requiring that manufacturers submit validation data, but allowing newly developed serological tests to be marketed without the usual approval process during this crisis. Although this rapid deployment was intended to benefit public health, the incomplete understanding of immune response to the virus and lack of assay vetting resulted in quality issues with some of these tests, and thus many were withdrawn after submission. Common assay platforms include lateral flow assays which can serve an important niche of low cost, rapid turnaround, and increased accessibility whereas established laboratory-based platforms based on ELISAs and chemiluminescence expand existing technologies to SARS-CoV-2 and can provide throughput and quantification capabilities. While most of the currently EUA assays rely on these well-established platforms, despite their apparent technical simplicity, there are numerous practical challenges both for manufacturers in developing and for end-users in running and interpreting such assays. Within are discussed technical challenges to serology development for SARS-CoV-2, with an emphasis on lateral flow assay technology.",COVID-19; Immunoassays; Lateral flow assay; Rapid diagnostics; SARS-CoV-2; Serological testing.,Emilie Ernst;Patricia Wolfe;Corrine Stahura;Katie A Edwards

Here we report two sensitive and automated testing-on-a-probe (TOP) biosensor assays for SARS-CoV-2 viral specific total antibodies (TAb) and surrogate neutralizing antibodies (SNAb), which are suitable for clinical use. The TOP assays employ an RBD-coated quartz probe using a Cy5-Streptavidin-polysacharide conjugate to improve sensitivity and minimize interference. Disposable cartridges containing pre-dispensed reagents require no liquid manipulation or fluidics during testing. The TOP-TAb assay exhibited higher sensitivity in the 0-7 DAOS window than a widely used FDA-EUA assay. The rapid and automated TOP-SNAb correlated well with two well-established SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization tests. The clinical utility of the TOP assays was demonstrated by evaluating early antibody responses in 120 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive adult hospitalized patients. Higher TAb and SNAb positivity rates and more robust antibody responses at patient's initial hospital presentation were seen in inpatients who survived COVID-19 than those who died in the hospital. Survival analysis using the Cox Proportional Hazards Model showed that patients who had negative TAb and/or SNAb at initial hospital presentation were at a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, TAb and SNAb levels at presentation were inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load based on concurrent RT-PCR testing.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33070955/,Comparative analysis of three laboratory based serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 in an Australian cohort,"Many unanswered questions remain regarding the role of SARS-CoV-2 serological assays in this unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. These include their utility for the diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, past infection or exposure, correlation with immunity and the effective duration of immunity. This study examined the performance of three laboratory based serological assays, EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA/IgG, MAGLUMI 2000 Plus 2019-nCov IgM/IgG and EDI Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG immunoassays. We evaluated 138 samples from a reference non-infected population and 71 samples from a cohort of 37 patients with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed positive by RT-PCR. The samples were collected at various intervals of 0-45 days post symptoms onset (PSO). Specificity and sensitivity of these assays was 60.9%/71.4% (IgA) and 94.2%/63.3% (IgG) for EUROIMMUN; 98.5%/18.4% (IgM) and 97.8%/53.1% (IgG) for MAGLUMI; and 94.9%/22.5% (IgM) and 93.5%/57.1% (IgG) for EDI, respectively. When samples collected ≥14 days PSO were considered, the sensitivities were 100.0 and 100.0%; 31.0 and 82.8%; 34.5 and 57.1%, respectively. Using estimated population prevalence of 0.1, 1, and 10%, the positive predictive value of all assays remained low.

It is accordingly important to develop accurate and rapid diagnostic methods. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method including reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most widely used assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Along with the RT-PCR method, digital PCR has emerged as a powerful tool to quantify nucleic acid of the virus with high accuracy and sensitivity. Non-PCR based techniques such as reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) are considered to be rapid and simple nucleic acid detection methods and were reviewed in this paper. Non-conventional molecular diagnostic methods including next-generation sequencing (NGS), CRISPR-based assays and nanotechnology are improving the accuracy and sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnosis. In this review, we also focus on standardization of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing and the activity of the National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) and highlight resources such as reference materials (RM) that provide the values of specified properties.

We have investigated the sensitivity and performance of different commercially available RT-qPCR kits in detecting SARS-CoV-2 using 80 extracted RNA and NSS from COVID-19 diagnosed patients. We evaluated the ability of each kit to detect viral RNA from both kit-extracted or directly from a pre-boiled NSS observing that direct RNA detection is possible when Ct values are lower than 30 with the three kits tested.

Serological assays are essential for community screening, assessing infection prevalence, aiding identification of infected patients, and enacting appropriate treatment and quarantine protocols in the battle against this rapidly expanding pandemic. Antibody detection by agglutination-PCR (ADAP) is a pure solution phase immunoassay that generates a PCR amplifiable signal when patient antibodies agglutinate DNA-barcoded antigen probes into a dense immune complex. Here, we present an ultrasensitive and high-throughput automated liquid biopsy assay based on the Hamilton Microlab ADAP STAR automated liquid-handling platform, which was developed and validated for the qualitative detection of total antibodies against spike protein 1 (S1) of SARS-CoV-2 that uses as little as 4 µL of serum. To assess the clinical performance of the ADAP assay, 57 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients and 223 control patients were tested. The assay showed a sensitivity of 98% (56/57) and a specificity of 99.55% (222/223). Notably, the SARS-CoV-2-negative control patients included individuals with other common coronaviral infections, such as CoV-NL63 and CoV-HKU, which did not cross-react. In addition to high performance, the hands-free automated workstation enabled high-throughput sample processing to reduce screening workload while helping to minimize analyst contact with biohazardous samples. Therefore, the ADAP STAR liquid-handling workstation can be used as a valuable tool to address the COVID-19 global pandemic.",PCR; agglutination; antibody; anti–spike protein; liquid handling.,Donna Grace Karp;Deanne Cuda;Devangkumar Tandel;Kenneth Danh;Peter V Robinson;David Seftel;Honglin Tian;Mark Pandori;Kevin W P Miller;Cheng-T Tsai

MATERIAL AND METHODS The medical records of 159 children who were admitted to our hospital from January 23 to March 20, 2020, were retrospectively analyzed. Samples from pharyngeal or/and anal swabs were subjected to reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 within 12 h of patient admission; a second RT-PCR test was done 24 h after the first test. RESULTS Of the 159 patients, 151 patients had epidemiological histories, 14 patients had cluster onset, and 8 patients had no epidemiological history but had symptoms similar to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The most common symptom was fever (n=125), followed by respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. A 7-year-old boy in a cluster family from Wuhan was confirmed with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection with ground-glass opacity shadows on his lung computed tomography scan, and his swab RT-PCR test had not turned negative until day 19 of his hospitalization. In patients who did not test positive for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus were observed. A total of 158 patients recovered, were discharged, and experienced no abnormalities during follow-up.

While most vaccines go through the designation and preparation stages, some of them are under evaluation for efficacy among animal models and clinical trials, and three approved vaccine candidates have been introduced for limited exploitation in Russia and China. An effective vaccine must induce a protective response of both cell-mediated and humoral immunity and should meet the safety and efficacy criteria. Although the emergence of new technologies has accelerated the development of vaccines, there are several challenges on the way, such as limited knowledge about the pathophysiology of the virus, inducing humoral or cellular immunity, immune enhancement with animal coronavirus vaccines, and lack of an appropriate animal model.

However, all laboratory tests are imperfect and have estimates of sensitivity and specificity less than 100%-in some cases, considerably less than 100%. That error will lead to biased prevalence estimates. If the true prevalence is low, possibly in the range of 1%-5%, then testing error will lead to a constant background of bias that most likely will be larger, and possibly much larger, than the true prevalence itself. As a result, what is needed is a method for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error. Methods are outlined in this article for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error both prospectively in studies being planned and retrospectively in studies that have been conducted. If used, these methods also would help harmonize study results within countries and worldwide. Adjustment can lead to more accurate prevalence estimates and to better policy decisions.

Clinicians should consider a test's characteristics, test timing in relation to symptom onset, and the pretest probability of disease when interpreting results. Molecular and antigen SARS-CoV-2 tests both have high specificity. However, antigen tests generally have lower sensitivity and thus greater potential for false-negative results. Pretest probability of disease should be based on a patient's exposure to someone with a confirmed or probable case, signs or symptoms of COVID-19, local or population-specific COVID-19 prevalence, and presence of an alternative diagnosis. Using a leaf plot is an efficient way to visualize posttest probability of disease based on estimated pretest probability and the test's sensitivity and specificity. A negative molecular or antigen test result might not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection when pretest probability is high, depending on the test's sensitivity. A symptom-based approach is preferred over a test-based approach for discontinuing isolation precautions for most patients with COVID-19 because prolonged shedding of viral RNA does not necessarily correlate with infectivity. Antibody tests might help identify past SARS-CoV-2 infection if performed two to four weeks after symptom onset; however, because of uncertainty about the extent and durability of postinfection or vaccine-induced immunity, they should not yet be used to infer immunity or guide discontinuation of personal protective measures.",,William D Nettleton

Beyond the health crisis, the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have serious global socio-economic consequences. It has also placed a significant pressure on the scientific community to understand the virus and its pathophysiology and rapidly provide anti-viral treatments and procedures in order to help the society and stop the virus spread. Here, we outline how advanced microscopy technologies such as high-throughput microscopy and electron microscopy played a major role in rapid response against SARS-CoV-2.

The asymptomatic carriers were not suspected of playing a significant role in the ongoing pandemic, and universal nucleic acid screening in close contacts of confirmed cases and asymptomatic carriers has been carried out in many medium- and high-risk areas for the spread of the virus. Recently, anal swabs for key population screening have been shown to not only reduce missed diagnoses but also facilitate the traceability of infectious sources. As a specimen for the detection of viruses, the goal of this paper is to briefly review the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 and the necessity of using anal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 screening to minimize transmission and a threat to other people with COVID-19.",anal swab; asymptomatic infections; close contact.; coronavirus disease 2019; nucleic acid; screening; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.,Yuliang Wang;Xiaobo Chen;Feng Wang;Jie Geng;Bingxu Liu;Feng Han

However, asymptomatic and presymptomatic patients remain undetected although the viral load may be high. In this retrospective cohort study, all hospitalized patients who received polymerase chain reaction (PCR) admission testing from March 26th until May 24th, 2020 were included. Data on COVID-19-specific symptoms and contact history to COVID-19 cases were retrospectively extracted from patient files and from contact tracing notes. The compliance to the universal testing protocol was high with 90%. Out of 6940 tested patients, 27 new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infections (0.4%) were detected. Seven of those COVID-19 cases (26% of all new cases) were asymptomatic and had no positive contact history, but were identified through a positive PCR test. The number needed to identify an asymptomatic patient was 425 in the first wave of the epidemic, 1218 in the low incidence phase. The specificity of the method was above 99.9%. Universal PCR testing was highly accepted by staff as demonstrated by high compliance.

Various detection approaches have been developed involving quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods, CRISPR-based systems, and direct targeting of specific coronavirus proteins. However, there have only been a few reports on the detection of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), the primer-independent RNA-replicable protein produced by the RNA genes of coronavirus. Here, we introduce a novel diagnostic methodology for COVID-19 using the RNA-directed and de novo RNA replicable function of RdRP. We devised an RNA platform for RdRP-induced transcription (RPRIT) that includes an RNA template that can be directly transcribed by RdRP. By utilizing RPRIT, the presence of RdRP can be readily confirmed within 30 min using isothermal incubation without PCR.

Reagent shortages may limit the expansion of testing required to scale back containment measures. The aims of this study were to investigate the viability of sample pooling as a strategy for increasing test throughput and conserving PCR reagents; and to report our early experience with pooling of clinical samples. A pre-implementation study was performed to assess the sensitivity and theoretical efficiency of two, four, and eight-sample pools in a real-time reverse transcription PCR-based workflow. A standard operating procedure was developed and implemented in two laboratories during periods of peak demand, inclusive of over 29,000 clinical samples processed in our laboratory. Sensitivity decreased (mean absolute increase in cycle threshold value of 0.6, 2.3, and 3.0 for pools of two, four, and eight samples, respectively) and efficiency increased as pool size increased. Gains from pooling diminished at high disease prevalence. Our standard operating procedure was successfully implemented across two laboratories. Increased workflow complexity imparts a higher risk of errors, and requires risk mitigation strategies. Turnaround time for individual samples increased, hence urgent samples should not be pooled.

Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is the most effective method to control disease spread and prevent further mortality. As such, a high-precision and rapid yet economic assay method is urgently required. Herein, we propose an innovative method to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using isothermal amplification of nucleic acids on a mesh containing multiple microfluidic pores. Hybridization of pathogen DNA and immobilized probes forms a DNA hydrogel by rolling circle amplification and, consequently, blocks the pores to prevent fluid movement, as observed. Following optimization of several factors, including pore size, mesh location, and precision microfluidics, the limit of detection (LOD) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined to be 0.7 aM at 15-min incubation.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33450867/,Overcoming Supply Shortage for SARS-CoV-2 Detection by RT-qPCR,"In February 2020, our laboratory started to offer a RT-qPCR assay for the qualitative detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. A few months after the assay was released to our patients, some materials, reagents, and equipment became in short supply. Alternative protocols were necessary in order to avoid stopping testing to the population. However, the suitability of these alternatives needs to be validated before their use. Here, we investigated if saliva is a reliable alternative specimen to nasopharyngeal swabs; if 0.45% saline is a reliable alternative to guanidine hydrochloride as a collection viral transport media; the stability of SARS-COV-2 in guanidine hydrochloride and in 0.45% saline for 10 and 50 days at room temperature; and if the primers/probe concentration and thermocycling times could be reduced so as to overcome the short supply of these reagents and equipment, without a significant loss of the assay performance. We found that saliva is not an appropriated specimen for our method-nasopharyngeal swabs perform better. Saline (0.45%) and guanidine hydrochloride have a similar SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic capability as tube additives. Reliable SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection can be performed after sample storage for 10 days at room temperature (18-23 °C) in both 0.45% saline and guanidine hydrochloride. Using synthetic RNA, and decreasing the concentration of primers by five-fold and probes by 2.5-fold, changed the assay limit of detection (LOD) from 7.2 copies/reaction to 23.7 copies/reaction and the subsequent reducing of thermocycling times changed the assay LOD from 23.7 copies/reaction to 44.2 copies/reaction. However, using real clinical samples with Cq values ranging from ~12.15 to ~36.46, the results of the three tested conditions were almost identical. These alterations will not affect the vast majority of diagnostics and increase the daily testing capability in 30% and increase primers and probe stocks in 500% and 250%, respectively. Taken together, the alternative protocols described here overcome the short supply of tubes, reagents and equipment during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, avoiding the collapse of test offering for the population: 105,757 samples were processed, and 25,156 SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics were performed from 9 May 2020 to 30 June 2020.",RT-qPCR; SARS-CoV-2; validation.,Gustavo Barcelos Barra;Ticiane Henriques Santa Rita;Pedro Góes Mesquita;Rafael Henriques Jácomo;Lídia Freire Abdalla Nery

However, hour-scale time-consumption is usually required to ensure the adequacy of immunobinding on expensive large instruments in hospitals, and the common false negative or positive results often occur in rapid on-site immunoassay (e.g. immunochromatography). We solved this dilemma by presenting a reciprocating-flowing immunobinding (RF-immunobinding) strategy. RF-immunobinding enabled the antibodies in fluid contacting with the corresponding immobilized antigens on substrate repeatedly during continuous reciprocating-flowing, to achieve adequate immunobinding within 60 s.

Saliva droplets containing SARS-COV-2 are a major vector for COVID-19 infection, making saliva a promising alternative for COVID-19 testing using nasopharyngeal swab samples. To diagnose COVID-19 patients in the field, a point-of-care test (POCT) using saliva was conceptualized. We have developed a simple method for extracting RNA from saliva samples using semi-alkaline proteinase, a sputum homogenizer typically used for preparing samples for tuberculosis testing, and a subsequent simple heating step with no need for centrifugation or RNA extraction. Further, we newly developed a triplex reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification approach (RT-LAMP) which utilizes colorimetric readout using a heat block, with results evaluated with the unaided eye. In 44 clinical patients suspected of having COVID-19 infection, the test took 45 min, and resulted in a diagnostic sensitivity of 82.6% (19/23) and diagnostic specificity of 100% (21/21), compared to the reference standard.

The worldwide urge for new diagnostic tools to control the pandemic has led to a quick incorporation in clinical practice of the recently developed serological assays. However, as only few comparative studies have been published, there is a lack of data about the diagnostic accuracy of currently available assays. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy to detect Ig G, Ig M+A, and/or IgA anti SARS-CoV-2 of 10 different assays: lateral flow card immunoassays, 4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and 3 chemiluminescent particle immunoassays (CMIA).

Serology testing may better evaluate the actual magnitude of the spread of infection in the population. This is the first nationwide seroprevalence study conducted in Israel. It is one of the most widespread to be conducted thus far, and the largest per-country population size. The survey was conducted between June 28 and September 14, 2020 and included 54,357 patients who arrived at the Health Maintenance Organizations to undergo a blood test for any reason. A patient was considered seropositive after two consecutive positive results with two different kits (Abbott and DiaSorin).The overall seroprevalence was 3.8% (95%CI 3.7-4.0), males higher than females [4.9% (95%CI 4.6-5.2) vs. 3.1% (95%CI 2.9-3.3) respectively]. Adolescents had the highest prevalence [7.8% (95%CI 7.0-8.6)] compared to other age groups. Participants who had undergone RT-PCR testing had a tenfold higher risk to be seropositive. The prevalence-to-incidence ratio was 4.5-15.7.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33436939/,Digital droplet PCR accurately quantifies SARS-CoV-2 viral load from crude lysate without nucleic acid purification,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus motivates diverse diagnostic approaches due to the novel causative pathogen, incompletely understood clinical sequelae, and limited availability of testing resources. Given the variability in viral load across and within patients, absolute viral load quantification directly from crude lysate is important for diagnosis and surveillance. Here, we investigate the use of digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 viral load measurement directly from crude lysate without nucleic acid purification. We demonstrate ddPCR accurately quantifies SARS-CoV-2 standards from purified RNA and multiple sample matrices, including commonly utilized universal transport medium (UTM). In addition, we find ddPCR functions robustly at low input viral copy numbers on nasopharyngeal swab specimens stored in UTM without upfront RNA extraction. We also show ddPCR, but not qPCR, from crude lysate shows high concordance with viral load measurements from purified RNA. Our data suggest ddPCR offers advantages to qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection with higher sensitivity and robustness when using crude lysate rather than purified RNA as input. More broadly, digital droplet assays provide a potential method for nucleic acid measurement and infectious disease diagnosis with limited sample processing, underscoring the utility of such techniques in laboratory medicine.",,Harish N Vasudevan;Peng Xu;Venice Servellita;Steve Miller;Leqian Liu;Allan Gopez;Charles Y Chiu;Adam R Abate

Understanding the potential sources of bias and methods for alleviating biases in these studies is important for informing their design and analysis. Confounding by individual-level risk factors in observational studies like these is relatively well appreciated. Here, we show how geographic structure and the underlying, natural dynamics of epidemics can also induce noncausal associations. We take the approach of simulating serological studies in the context of an uncontrolled or controlled epidemic, under different assumptions about whether prior infection does or does not protect an individual against subsequent infection, and using various designs and analytical approaches to analyze the simulated data.

However, this test takes considerable time before test results become available, thereby delaying patients from being diagnosed, treated, and isolated immediately. Rapid antigen tests could overcome this problem. In the first study, clinical performances of five rapid antigen tests were compared to RT-qPCR in upper respiratory specimens from 40 patients with positive and 40 with negative RTq-PCR results. In the second study, the rapid antigen test with one of the best test characteristics (Romed) was evaluated in a large prospective collection of upper respiratory specimens from 900 different COVID-19-suspected patients (300 emergency room patients, 300 nursing home patients, and 300 health care workers). Test specificities ranged from 87.5 to 100.0%, and test sensitivities from 55.0 to 80.0%. The clinical specificity of the Romed test was 99.8% (95% CI 98.9-100). Overall clinical sensitivity in the study population was 73.3% (95% CI 67.9-78.2), whereas sensitivity in the different patient groups varied from 65.3 to 86.7%.

The identification of these patients is crucial in order to prevent virus circulation. No reliable data on the sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are available because of the lack of a shared reference standard to identify SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The aim of our study was to collect data on patients with a known diagnosis of COVID-19 who underwent serial testing to assess NPS sensitivity. Methods: The study was a multi-center, observational, retrospective clinical study with consecutive enrollment. We enrolled patients who met all of the following inclusion criteria: clinical recovery, documented SARS-CoV-2 infection (≥1 positive rRT-PCR result) and ≥1 positive NPS among the first two follow-up swabs. A positive NPS not preceded by a negative nasopharyngeal swab collected 24-48 h earlier was considered a true positive. A negative NPS followed by a positive NPS collected 24-48 h later was regarded as a false negative. The primary outcome was to define sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection with NPS. Results: Three hundred and ninety three NPS were evaluated in 233 patients; the sensitivity was 77% (95% CI, 73 to 81%). Sensitivity of the first follow-up NPS (n = 233) was 79% (95% CI, 73 to 84%) with no significant variations over time.

As cats are popular pets and susceptible to Coronavirus, we investigated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in shelter cats housed in Dutch animal shelters during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this large-scale cross-sectional study, serum samples of shelter cats were collected during the second wave of human COVID-19 infections in The Netherlands. Seroprevalence was determined by using an indirect protein-based ELISA validated for cats, and a Virus Neutralization Test (VNT) as confirmation. To screen for feline SARS-CoV-2 shedding, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs of cats positive for ELISA and/or VNT were analyzed using PCR tests. In 28 Dutch animal shelters, 240 shelter cats were convenience sampled. Two of these cats (0.8%; CI 95%: 0.1-3.0%) were seropositive, as evidenced by the presence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. The seropositive animals tested PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34556690/,A new qualitative RT-PCR assay detecting SARS-CoV-2,"The world is facing an exceptional pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. To allow the diagnosis of COVID-19 infections, several assays based on the real-time PCR technique have been proposed. The requests for diagnosis are such that it was immediately clear that the choice of the most suitable method for each microbiology laboratory had to be based, on the one hand, on the availability of materials, and on the other hand, on the personnel and training priorities for this activity. Unfortunately, due to high demand, the shortage of commercial diagnostic kits has also become a major problem. To overcome these critical issues, we have developed a new qualitative RT-PCR probe. Our system detects three genes-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N)-and uses the β-actin gene as an endogenous internal control. The results from our assay are in complete agreement with the results obtained using a commercially available kit, except for two samples that did not pass the endogenous internal control. The coincidence rate was 0.96. The LoD of our assay was 140 cp/reaction for N and 14 cp/reaction for RdRp and E. Our kit was designed to be open, either for the nucleic acid extraction step or for the RT-PCR assay, and to be carried out on several instruments. Therefore, it is free from the industrial production logics of closed systems, and conversely, it is hypothetically available for distribution in large quantities to any microbiological laboratory. The kit is currently distributed worldwide (called MOLgen-COVID-19; Adaltis).

Accordingly, microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) have emerged as promising diagnostic tools. Among the extensive efforts to improve the performance and usability of diagnostic tools, biosensing mechanisms based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) have shown great promise because of their label-free operation and high sensitivity. However, the method to improve EIS biosensing on μPADs is less explored. Here, we present an experimental approach to enhancing the performance of paper-based EIS biosensors featuring zinc oxide nanowires (ZnO NWs) directly grown on working electrodes (WEs). Through a comparison of different EIS settings and an examination of ZnO-NW effects on EIS measurements, we show that ZnO-NW-enhanced WEs function reliably with Faradaic processes utilizing iron-based electron mediators. We calibrate paper-based EIS biosensors with different morphologies of ZnO NWs and achieve a low limit of detection (0.4 pg ml-1) in detecting p24 antigen as a marker for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Through microscopic imaging and electrochemical characterization, we reveal that the morphological and the electrochemical surface areas of ZnO-NW-enhanced WEs indicate the sensitivities and sensing ranges of the EIS nanobiosensors. Finally, we report that the EIS nanobiosensors are capable of differentiating the concentrations (blank, 10 ng ml-1, 100 ng ml-1, and 1 μg ml-1) of IgG antibody (CR3022) to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum samples, demonstrating the efficacy of these devices for COVID-19 diagnosis.

They hold similar potential to advance COVID-19 control and prevention, but SARS-CoV-2 viral load tests are not yet widely available. SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic tests, which typically employ real-time RT-PCR, yield semiquantitative results only. Droplet digital RT-PCR (RT-ddPCR) offers an attractive platform for SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification. Eight primer/probe sets originally developed for real-time RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests were evaluated for use in RT-ddPCR; three were identified as the most efficient, precise, and sensitive for RT-ddPCR-based SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification. For example, the analytical efficiency for the E-Sarbeco primer/probe set was approximately 83%, whereas assay precision, measured as the coefficient of variation, was approximately 2% at 1000 input copies/reaction. Lower limits of quantification and detection for this primer/probe set were 18.6 and 4.4 input SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/reaction, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral loads in a convenience panel of 48 COVID-19-positive diagnostic specimens spanned a 6.2log10 range, confirming substantial viral load variation in vivo. RT-ddPCR-derived SARS-CoV-2 E gene copy numbers were further calibrated against cycle threshold values from a commercial real-time RT-PCR diagnostic platform.

The target of neutralising antibodies is usually located in the Envelope protein on the viral surface, which mediates cell entry. As such, presentation of the Envelope protein on a lentiviral particle represents a convenient alternative to handling of a potentially high containment virus or for those viruses with no established cell culture system. The flexibility, relative safety and, in most cases, ease of production of lentiviral pseudotypes, have led to their use in serological assays for many applications such as the evaluation of candidate vaccines, screening and characterization of anti-viral therapeutics, and sero-surveillance. Above all, the speed of production of the lentiviral pseudotypes, once the envelope sequence is published, makes them important tools in the response to viral outbreaks, as shown during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In this review, we provide an overview of the landscape of the serological applications of pseudotyped lentiviral vectors, with a brief discussion on their production and batch quality analysis. Finally, we evaluate their role as surrogates for the real virus and possible alternatives.",lentivirus; pseudotype; serology; vector.,Kamilla Toon;Emma M Bentley;Giada Mattiuzzo

Alaska includes many remote and isolated villages with small populations (ranging from 15 to >1,000 persons) that are accessible only by air from larger communities. Until rapid point-of-care testing became widely available, a primary challenge in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in rural Alaska was slow turnaround times for SARS-CoV-2 test results, attributable to the need to transport specimens to testing facilities. To provide more timely test results and isolation of cases, the Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporation (YKHC) introduced Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag rapid antigen test (BinaxNOW) on November 9, 2020, in the rural Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region in southwestern Alaska. To evaluate the impact of implementing antigen testing, YKHC reviewed the results of 54,981 antigen and molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 performed in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta during September 15, 2020-March 1, 2021. Introduction of rapid, point-of-care testing was followed by a more than threefold reduction in daily SARS-CoV-2 case rates during approximately 1 month before the introduction of COVID-19 vaccination. The median turnaround time for SARS-CoV-2 test results decreased by >30%, from 6.4 days during September 15-November 8, 2020, to 4.4 days during November 9, 2020-March 1, 2021 (p<0.001). Daily incidence decreased 65% after the introduction of BinaxNOW, from 342 cases per 100,000 population during the week of November 9 to 119 during the week of December 13 (p<0.001). These findings indicate that point-of-care rapid antigen testing can be a valuable tool in reducing turnaround times in rural communities where local access to laboratory-based nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is not readily available and could thereby reduce transmission by facilitating rapid isolation of infected persons, contact tracing, and implementation of local mitigation strategies.",,Ellen Hodges;Brian Lefferts;Elizabeth Bates;Christine Desnoyers;Dana Bruden;Michael Bruce;Joseph McLaughlin

Our paper aims to compare the clinical sensitivity of different commercial RT-qPCR (Genesig, 1copy, DNA-Techonolgy and Charité primer-probe sets), isothermal PCR (Ustar Isothermal Amplification-Real Time Fluorescent Assay) and immunochromatographic antigen detection (BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag) assays developed to use in laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19. A total of 119 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from symptomatic patients. A subset of samples, positive with two RT-qPCR assays were then tested with isothermal PCR and rapid antigen tests. Of the 119 specimens, 65 were positive by at least two PCR assays. All PCR assays showed substantial or perfect match, although some variations in the clinical performance was observed. Of the 37 and 32 remnant nasopharyngeal samples positive by RT-qPCR, respectively, three were positive by the BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag and 14 were detected by the isothermal amplification assay. In conclusion, in the clinical settings we recorded that each of the RT-qPCR assays was superior to other test formats, in particular, the routine use of the DNA-technology assay is recommended. Although alternative recommendations exist, we belive that the use of isothermal amplifiaction assays and antigen rapid tests for COVID-19 diagnosis can only serve as adjuncts while awaiting the PCR result because of their high false-negative rate.",COVID-19; Laboratory diagnostics; RT-qPCR; SARS CoV-2.,Bence Kenyeres;Noel Ánosi;Krisztián Bányai;Mária Mátyus;László Orosz;Andrea Kiss;Beatrix Kele;Katalin Burián;György Lengyel

Recommendations from the WHO COVID Emergency Committee continue to support strengthening COVID surveillance systems, including timely access to effective diagnostics. Questions were raised about the validity of considering the RT-PCR as the gold standard in COVID-19 diagnosis. It has been suggested that a variety of methods should be used to evaluate advocated tests. Dogs had been successfully trained and employed to detect diseases in humans. Here we show that upon training explosives detection dogs on sniffing COVID-19 odor in patients' sweat, those dogs were able to successfully screen out 3249 individuals who tested negative for the SARS-CoV-2, from a cohort of 3290 individuals. Additionally, using Bayesian analysis, the sensitivity of the K9 test was found to be superior to the RT-PCR test performed on nasal swabs from a cohort of 3134 persons. Given its high sensitivity, short turn-around-time, low cost, less invasiveness, and ease of application, the detection dogs test lends itself as a better alternative to the RT-PCR in screening for SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals.",,Mohammed Hag-Ali;Abdul Salam AlShamsi;Linda Boeijen;Yasser Mahmmod;Rashid Manzoor;Harry Rutten;Marshal M Mweu;Mohamed El-Tholoth;Abdullatif Alteraifi AlShamsi

Thus, as the creation and translation of effective COVID-19 vaccines continues at an unprecedented speed, the development of fast and effective methods to measure neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 will become increasingly important to determine long-term protection against infection for both previously infected and immunized individuals.

The aims of this study were to investigate antibody levels in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, to examine the relationship between antibody levels and virus load, and to evaluate the performance of 2 different commercial kits. A total of 103 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the study. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum samples taken from patients were investigated simultaneously with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA ELISAs (Euroimmun) and COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG/IgM (Deep Blue) kits. No positivity was detected with any of the test kits in 18 (17.4%) of the 103 samples. In symptomatic patients, 100% of IgM and IgA tests were found to be positive in the group sampled after 10 days, while 100% of IgG tests were found positive after 20 days. The sensitivity of the Deep Blue COVID-19 IgG antibody kit was calculated as 81.48% and the specificity was 97.96%. While there was no statistically significant difference between the PCR CT and ELISA OD values, a positive correlation was found between the ELISA OD values and the days since the date of symptom initiation. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid antibody test used in this study were found to be quite high. In conditions where ELISA tests cannot be applied, it is thought that it can give an idea in terms of the presence of antibodies as a simple and fast test.

Herein, we present a sensitive biosensor strategy depended on botulinum neurotoxin type A light chain (BoNT/A LC) activated complex assay (BACA). BoNT/A LC, the surrogate of BoNT/A which embodying the most potent biological poisons, could serve as an ultrasensitive signal reporter with high signal-to-noise ratio to avoid common strong background response, poor stability and low intensity of current biosensor methods. A nanoparticle hybridization system, involving specific binding probes that recognize pathogenic 16S rRNAs or SARS-CoV-2 gene site, was developed to measure double-stranded biotinylated target DNA containing a single-stranded overhang using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based assay and colorimetric method. The method is validated widely by six different bacteria strains and severe acute respiratory related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid, demonstrating a single cell or 1 aM nucleic acid detecting sensitivity. This detection strategy offers a solution for general applications and has a great prospect to be a simple instrument-free colorimetric tool, especially when facing public health emergency.",Bacterial diagnostic; Biosensors; Botulinum toxin; Colorimetric detection; Fluorescence resonance energy transfer; SARS-CoV-2.,Fengge Song;Yuanyuan Shen;Yangdao Wei;Chunrong Yang;Xiaolin Ge;Aimin Wang;Chaoyang Li;Yi Wan;Jinghong Li
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34406838/,Saliva is Comparable to Nasopharyngeal Swabs for Molecular Detection of SARS-CoV-2,"The continued need for molecular testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the potential for self-collected saliva as an alternative to nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs for sample acquisition led us to compare saliva to NP swabs in an outpatient setting without restrictions to avoid food, drink, smoking, or tooth-brushing. A total of 385 pairs of NP and saliva specimens were obtained, the majority from individuals presenting for initial evaluation, and were tested on two high-sensitivity reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) platforms, the Abbott m2000 and Abbott Alinity m (both with limits of detection [LoD] of 100 copies of viral RNA/ml). Concordance between saliva and NP swabs was excellent overall (Cohen's κ = 0.93) for both initial and follow-up testing, for both platforms, and for specimens treated with guanidinium transport medium as preservative as well as for untreated saliva (κ = 0.88 to 0.95). Viral loads were on average 16× higher in NP specimens than saliva specimens, suggesting that only the relatively small fraction of outpatients (∼8% in this study) who present with very low viral loads (<1,600 copies/ml from NP swabs) would be missed by testing saliva instead of NP swabs when using sensitive testing platforms. Special attention was necessary to ensure leak-resistant specimen collection and transport. The advantages of self-collection of saliva, without behavioral restrictions, will likely outweigh a minor potential decrease in clinical sensitivity in individuals less likely to pose an infectious risk to others for many real-world scenarios, especially for initial testing. IMPORTANCE In general, the most accurate COVID-19 testing is hands-on and uncomfortable, requiring trained staff and a ""brain-tickling"" nasopharyngeal swab. Saliva would be much easier on both fronts, since patients could collect it themselves, and it is after all just spit. However, despite much interest, it remains unclear how well saliva performs in real-world settings when just using it in place of an NP swab without elaborate or cumbersome restrictions about not eating/drinking before testing, etc. Also, almost all studies of COVID-19 testing, whether of NP swabs, saliva, or otherwise, have been restricted to reporting results in the abstruse units of ""CT values,"" which only mean something in the context of a specific assay and testing platform. Here, we compared saliva versus NP swabs in a real-world setting without restriction and report all results in natural units-the amount of virus being shed-showing that saliva is essentially just as good as NP swabs.",COVID-19; NP swab; SARS-CoV-2; limit of detection; saliva.,Cody Callahan;Sarah Ditelberg;Sanjucta Dutta;Nancy Littlehale;Annie Cheng;Kristin Kupczewski;Danielle McVay;Stefan Riedel;James E Kirby;Ramy Arnaout
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33493896/,Entropy-driven amplified electrochemiluminescence biosensor for RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2 detection with self-assembled DNA tetrahedron scaffolds,"Dependable, specific and rapid diagnostic methods for severe acute respiratory syndrome β-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) detection are needed to promote public health interventions for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Herein, we have established an entropy-driven amplified electrochemiluminescence (ECL) strategy to detect the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of SARS-CoV-2 known as RdRp-COVID which as the target for SARS-CoV-2 plays an essential role in the diagnosis of COVID-19. For the construction of the sensors, DNA tetrahedron (DT) is modified on the surface of the electrode to furnish robust and programmable scaffolds materials, upon which target DNA-participated entropy-driven amplified reaction is efficiently conducted to link the Ru (bpy)32+ modified S3 to the linear ssDNA at the vertex of the tetrahedron and eventually present an ""ECL on"" state. The rigid tetrahedral structure of the DT probe enhances the ECL intensity and avoids the cross-reactivity between single-stranded DNA, thus increasing the sensitivity of the assays. The enzyme-free entropy-driven reaction prevents the use of expensive enzyme reagents and facilitates the realization of large-scale screening of SARS-CoV-2 patients. Our DT-based ECL sensor has demonstrated significant specificity and high sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 with a limit of detection (LOD) down to 2.67 fM. Additionally, our operational method has achieved the detection of RdRp-COVID in human serum samples, which supplies a reliable and feasible sensing platform for the clinical bioanalysis.",DNA tetrahedron; Electrochemiluminescence sensor; Entropy-driven reaction amplification; RdRp-COVID; SARS-CoV-2.,Zhenqiang Fan;Bo Yao;Yuedi Ding;Jing Zhao;Minhao Xie;Kai Zhang

In order to investigate the longitudinal serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 natural infection and vaccination, a large-scale, multi-year serosurveillance program entitled SPARTA (SARS SeroPrevalence and Respiratory Tract Assessment) was initiated at 4 locations in the U.S. The serological assay presented here measuring IgG binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) detected antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination with a 95.5% sensitivity and a 95.9% specificity. We used this assay to screen more than 3100 participants and selected 20 previously infected pre-immune and 32 immunologically naïve participants to analyze their antibody binding to RBD and viral neutralization (VN) responses following vaccination with two doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 or the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine. Vaccination not only elicited a more robust immune reaction than natural infection, but the level of neutralizing and anti-RBD antibody binding after vaccination is also significantly higher in pre-immune participants compared to immunologically naïve participants (p<0.0033). Furthermore, the administration of the second vaccination did not further increase the neutralizing or binding antibody levels in pre-immune participants (p=0.69). However, ~46% of the immunologically naïve participants required both vaccinations to seroconvert.",SARS-CoV-2; antibody response; coronavirus; immunization; neutralization; pre-immune; vaccination.,David Forgacs;Hyesun Jang;Rodrigo B Abreu;Hannah B Hanley;Jasper L Gattiker;Alexandria M Jefferson;Ted M Ross

Here, we describe a molecular nanotechnology that enables direct and sensitive detection of viral RNA targets in native clinical samples. The technology, termed catalytic amplification by transition-state molecular switch (CATCH), leverages DNA-enzyme hybrid complexes to form a molecular switch. By ratiometric tuning of its constituents, the multicomponent molecular switch is prepared in a hyperresponsive state-the transition state-that can be readily activated upon the binding of sparse RNA targets to turn on substantial enzymatic activity. CATCH thus achieves superior performance (~8 RNA copies/μl), direct fluorescence detection that bypasses all steps of PCR (<1 hour at room temperature), and versatile implementation (high-throughput 96-well format and portable microfluidic assay). When applied for clinical COVID-19 diagnostics, CATCH demonstrated direct and accurate detection in minimally processed patient swab samples.",,Noah R Sundah;Auginia Natalia;Yu Liu;Nicholas R Y Ho;Haitao Zhao;Yuan Chen;Qing Hao Miow;Yu Wang;Darius L L Beh;Ka Lip Chew;Douglas Chan;Paul A Tambyah;Catherine W M Ong;Huilin Shao

Here we tested the neutralizing activity of infected and/or vaccinated individuals against pseudoviruses expressing the spike of the original SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (WH1), the D614G mutant and the B.1.1.7 variant. Our data show that parameters of natural infection (time from infection and nature of the infecting variant) determined cross-neutralization. Uninfected vaccinees showed a small reduction in neutralization against the B.1.1.7 variant compared to both the WH1 strain and the D614G mutant.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33289117/,Over 90% of clinical swabs used for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics contain sufficient nucleic acid concentrations,"During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), reliable diagnostics are absolutely indispensable. Molecular SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics based on nucleic acids (NA) derived from oro- or nasopharyngeal swabs constitute the current gold standard. Given the importance of test results, it is crucial to assess the quality of the underlying swab samples and NA extraction procedures. We determined NA concentrations in clinical samples used for SARS-CoV-2 testing applying an NA-specific dye. In comparison to cut-offs defined by SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, internal positive controls, and references from a federal laboratory, 90.85% (923 of 1016) of swabs contained NA concentrations enabling SARS-CoV-2 recognition. Swabs collected by local health authorities and the central emergency department either had significantly higher NA concentrations or were less likely to exhibit insufficient quality, arguing in favor of sampling centers with routined personnel. Interestingly, samples taken from females had significantly higher NA concentrations than those from males. Among eight longitudinal patient sample sets with intermitting negative quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results, two showed reduced NA concentrations in negative specimens. The herein described fluorescence-based NA quantification approach is immediately applicable to evaluate swab qualities, optimize sampling strategies, identify patient-specific differences, and explain some peculiar test results including intermittent negative samples with low NA concentrations.",COVID-19; RT-qPCR diagnostics; SARS-CoV-2; intermittent negative; nucleic acid quantification; swab quality control.,Robin L Klingen;Benjamin Katschinski;Olympia E Anastasiou;R Stefan Ross;Ulf Dittmer;Vu Thuy Khanh Le-Trilling;Mirko Trilling
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34431689/,Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-Based Detection Using Saliva or Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimens in Asymptomatic Populations,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged clinical diagnostic operations due to supply shortages and high staffing needs to collect nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples. Saliva is an easily accessible alternative specimen type to overcome some of these challenges. In this study, we first used paired saliva and NP swab specimens (n = 128) to compare test performance characteristics with three RNA extraction platforms, i.e., Maxwell RSC (Promega), MagNA Pure 96 (Roche), and KingFisher Flex (Thermo Fisher Scientific), together with two PCR chemistries, i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (2019-nCoV) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) quantitative PCR (qPCR) probe assay (Integrated DNA Technologies) and TagPath COVID-19 combination kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). This study demonstrated that both saliva and NP swab specimens performed well, with 97% agreement when tested by the CDC qPCR chemistry using Maxwell and MagNA Pure RNA extraction platforms. We then compared 12 weeks of saliva and NP swab testing results using two independent asymptomatic populations, including a community surveillance program using saliva samples only (n = 466) and preoperative screening using NP swab samples only (n = 8,461). The positive detection rates among participants with either saliva or NP swab samples were 1.07% and 1.12%, respectively, which confirms the low pretest probabilities for COVID-19 infections in asymptomatic populations. Notably, there was no increased proportion of low-titer cases (inconclusive results) reported in the asymptomatic groups, compared with the all-comers groups (0.21% and 0.66%, respectively, in the community population and 0.25% and 0.49%, respectively, in the preoperative population); this suggests that low-viral-titer carriers can be found similarly in both groups with saliva or NP swab specimens. In summary, saliva can be considered a good alternative for noninvasive but well-instructed self-collection. IMPORTANCE Our study shows that saliva is a noninvasive respiratory secretion sample type that contains equal or more host materials (RNase P), compared with those contained in the corresponding NP swab specimens, in 103 paired samples. SARS-CoV-2 detection with two RNA extraction platforms, Maxwell and MagNA Pure, with CDC qPCR chemistry showed similar test sensitivities for paired specimens. We then analyzed SARS-CoV-2 detections rates in two independent groups of asymptomatic participants, i.e., a group at a community screening station with supervised saliva collection only (n = 466) and a preoperative screening group (n = 8,461) with NP swabbing only. Similar detection rates of 1.07% for the community group and 1.12% for the preoperative group supported the similar test performances in these groups predicted to have low pretest probabilities of infection. With mindful preparation, saliva can be considered for schools and clinical participants when adequate collection education can be provided and compliance can be established.",SARS-CoV-2; asymptomatic; saliva.,Guang Fan;Xuan Qin;Daniel N Streblow;Cristina Magallanes Hoyos;Donna E Hansel

Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is currently the standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Although various nucleic acid-based assays have been developed to aid the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 patient samples, the objective of this study was to develop a diagnostic test that can be completed in 30 minutes without having to isolate RNA from the samples. Here, we present an RNA amplification detection method performed using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) reactions to achieve specific, rapid (30 min), and sensitive (<100 copies) fluorescent detection in real-time of SARS-CoV-2 directly from patient nasopharyngeal swab (NP) samples. When compared to RT-qPCR, positive NP swab samples assayed by fluorescent RT-LAMP had 98% (n = 41/42) concordance and negative NP swab samples assayed by fluorescent RT-LAMP had 87% (n = 59/68) concordance for the same samples. Importantly, the fluorescent RT-LAMP results were obtained without purification of RNA from the NP swab samples in contrast to RT-qPCR. We also show that the fluorescent RT-LAMP assay can specifically detect live virus directly from cultures of both SARS-CoV-2 wild type (WA1/2020), and a SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant strain with equal sensitivity to RT-qPCR.

A methodology is proposed for the determination of maximum pool size and adjustments of cut-off values of cycle threshold (Ct in RT-qPCR pool testing, to compensate for the dilution caused by pooling. The trade-off between pool size and test sensitivity is stated explicitly. The procedure was designed to ensure that samples that would be detectable in individual testing remain detectable in pool testing. The proposed relaxation in cut-off is dependent on the pool size, allowing a relatively tight correction to avoid loss of detection of positive samples. The methodology was evaluated in a study of pool testing of adults attending a public emergency care unit, reference for COVID-19 in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and presenting flu-like symptoms. Even samples on the edge of detectability in individual testing were detected correctly. The proposed procedure enhances the consistency of RT-qPCR pool testing by enforcing that the scales of detectability in pool processing and in individual sample processing are compatible. This may enhance the contribution of pool testing to large-scale testing for COVID-19.",COVID-19; RT-qPCR; SARS-CoV-2; pool testing.,Murilo S Costa;Hugo I Sato;Raissa P Rocha;Alex F Carvalho;Nathalia S Guimarães;Elaine L Machado;Claudia R L Alves;Santuza M R Teixeira;Ricardo H C Takahashi;Unaí Tupinambás;Flávio G da Fonseca

Although multiple diagnostic methods utilize nasopharyngeal specimens, saliva specimens represent an attractive alternative as they can rapidly and safely be collected from different populations. While saliva has been described as an acceptable clinical matrix for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, evaluations of analytic performance across platforms for this specimen type are limited. Here, we used a novel sensitive RT-PCR/MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry-based assay (Agena MassARRAY®) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva specimens. The platform demonstrated high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when compared to matched patient upper respiratory specimens. We also evaluated the analytical sensitivity of the platform and determined the limit of detection of the assay to be 1562.5 copies/ml. Furthermore, across the five individual target components of this assay, there was a range in analytic sensitivities for each target with the N2 target being the most sensitive. Overall, this system also demonstrated comparable performance when compared to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva by the cobas® 6800/8800 SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR Test (Roche). Together, we demonstrate that saliva represents an appropriate matrix for SARS-CoV-2 detection on the novel Agena system as well as on a conventional real-time RT-PCR assay.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33768365/,Spike vs nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection: application in nasopharyngeal swab specimens,"Public health experts emphasize the need for quick, point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection as an effective strategy for controlling virus spread. To this end, many ""antigen"" detection devices were developed and commercialized. These devices are mostly based on detecting SARS-CoV-2's nucleocapsid protein. Recently, alerts issued by both the FDA and the CDC raised concerns regarding the devices' tendency to exhibit false positive results. In this work, we developed a novel alternative spike-based antigen assay, comprising four high-affinity, specific monoclonal antibodies, directed against different epitopes on the spike's S1 subunit. The assay's performance was evaluated for COVID-19 detection from nasopharyngeal swabs, compared to an in-house nucleocapsid-based assay, composed of novel antibodies directed against the nucleocapsid. Detection of COVID-19 was carried out in a cohort of 284 qRT-PCR positive and negative nasopharyngeal swab samples. The time resolved fluorescence (TRF) ELISA spike assay displayed very high specificity (99%) accompanied with a somewhat lower sensitivity (66% for Ct < 25), compared to the nucleocapsid ELISA assay which was more sensitive (85% for Ct < 25) while less specific (87% specificity). Despite being outperformed by qRT-PCR, we suggest that there is room for such tests in the clinical setting, as cheap and rapid pre-screening tools. Our results further suggest that when applying antigen detection, one must consider its intended application (sensitivity vs specificity), taking into consideration that the nucleocapsid might not be the optimal target. In this regard, we propose that a combination of both antigens might contribute to the validity of the results. Schematic representation of sample collection and analysis.

CRISPR-Cas systems have been harnessed to develop sensitive and specific platforms for nucleic acid detection. These detection platforms take advantage of CRISPR enzymes' RNA-guided specificity for RNA and DNA targets and collateral trans activities on single-stranded RNA and DNA reporters. Microbial genomes possess an extensive range of CRISPR enzymes with different specificities and levels of collateral activity; identifying new enzymes may improve CRISPR-based diagnostics. Here, we identified a new Cas13 variant, which we named as miniature Cas13 (mCas13), and characterized its catalytic activity. We then employed this system to design, build, and test a SARS-CoV-2 detection module coupling reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) with the mCas13 system to detect SARS-CoV-2 in synthetic and clinical samples. Our system exhibits sensitivity and specificity comparable to other CRISPR systems. This work expands the repertoire and application of Cas13 enzymes in diagnostics and for potential in vivo applications, including RNA knockdown and editing.

We report an aptamer-based SARS-CoV-2 salivary antigen assay employing only low-cost reagents ($3.20/test) and an off-the-shelf glucometer. The test was engineered around a glucometer as it is quantitative, easy to use, and the most prevalent piece of diagnostic equipment globally, making the test highly scalable with an infrastructure that is already in place. Furthermore, many glucometers connect to smartphones, providing an opportunity to integrate with contact tracing apps, medical providers, and electronic health records. In clinical testing, the developed assay detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in patient saliva across a range of viral loads - as benchmarked by RT-qPCR - within 1 h, with 100% sensitivity (positive percent agreement) and distinguished infected specimens from off-target antigens in uninfected controls with 100% specificity (negative percent agreement).

We also performed a bridging study comparing the RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay with the new Abbott Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay. A number of standards, reference materials, and commercially available controls were used for the analytical verification to confirm the limit of detection, linearity, and reproducibility. We used nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens collected in saline for the clinical verification and bridging studies. Overall, we found 91.2% positive percent agreement (PPA; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 76.2 to 98.14%) and a 100% negative percent agreement (NPA; 95% CI = 97.97 to 100%) between the results of the RealTime SARS-CoV-2 and CDC tests with 217 NP specimens (P = 0.13).

Limitations of the gold standard qRT-PCR for diagnosis of this infection includes need for expensive equipment, specialized molecular laboratory, and experienced staff. Currently, CRISPR-based diagnostic method was approved by the U.S. FDA for rapid detection. Several studies developed SARS-CoV-2 detection based on CRISPR-Cas12a platform; however, the validations with RNA extracted from clinical specimens were limited. Therefore, this study evaluated the clinical performance of previously described CRISPR-Cas12a based diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV-2. According to the results, the CRISPR-Cas12a assays on N1 and S genes provided diagnostic accuracy (≥ 95 %) comparable to the qRT-PCR results. The assays with E, N2 and S genes yielded acceptable sensitivity of detection (≥ 95 %) whereas N1 and S genes provided outstanding specificity of detection (100 %). Preferably, multiple target genes should be detected by using CRISPR-Cas12a to ensure the most effective SARS-CoV-2 detection.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34087339/,Comparison of eleven in vitro diagnostic assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA,"Transmission mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 requires the availability of accurate and sensitive detection methods. There are several commercial ad hoc molecular diagnostic kits currently on the market, many of which have been evaluated by different groups. However, in low resource settings the availability and cost of these commercial kits can be a limiting factor for many diagnostic laboratories. In such cases alternatives need to be identified. With this in mind, eight commercial reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) master mixes from Applied Biosystems (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Bio-Rad, Biotech Rabbit, Promega, Qiagen, QuantaBio, Invitrogen (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Takara using the same commercial primer and probe mix [LightMix® Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene mix (TIB MolBiol, Germany)] were evaluated. Three ad hoc molecular diagnostic kits [GeneFinder™ COVID-19 Plus RealAmp kit (Osang Healthcare); genesig® Real-Time PCR Coronavirus COVID-19 (Primerdesign); and ViroReal® Kit SARS-CoV-2 & SARS-CoV (Ingenetix)] were also included in the study. The limit of detection was calculated for each assay using serial dilutions of a defined clinical sample. The performances of the assays were compared using a panel of 178 clinical samples and their analytical specificity assessed against a panel of human betacoronaviruses. Inter assay agreement was assessed using statistical tests (Bland-Altman, Fleiss-Kappa and Cohen's Kappa) and was shown to be excellent to good in all cases.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33924636/,Deepening of In Silico Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 Detection RT-qPCR Assays in the Context of New Variants,"For 1 year now, the world is undergoing a coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The most widely used method for COVID-19 diagnosis is the detection of viral RNA by RT-qPCR with a specific set of primers and probe. It is important to frequently evaluate the performance of these tests and this can be done first by an in silico approach. Previously, we reported some mismatches between the oligonucleotides of publicly available RT-qPCR assays and SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected from GISAID and NCBI, potentially impacting proper detection of the virus. In the present study, 11 primers and probe sets investigated during the first study were evaluated again with 84,305 new SARS-CoV-2 unique genomes collected between June 2020 and January 2021. The lower inclusivity of the China CDC assay targeting the gene N has continued to decrease with new mismatches detected, whereas the other evaluated assays kept their inclusivity above 99%. Additionally, some mutations specific to new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern were found to be located in oligonucleotide annealing sites. This might impact the strategy to be considered for future SARS-CoV-2 testing. Given the potential threat of the new variants, it is crucial to assess if they can still be correctly targeted by the primers and probes of the RT-qPCR assays. Our study highlights that considering the evolution of the virus and the emergence of new variants, an in silico (re-)evaluation should be performed on a regular basis. Ideally, this should be done for all the RT-qPCR assays employed for SARS-CoV-2 detection, including also commercial tests, although the primer and probe sequences used in these kits are rarely disclosed, which impedes independent performance evaluation.",COVID-19; RT-qPCR; SARS-CoV-2; WGS data; bioinformatics tool; detection; in silico specificity evaluation; mismatches; primers and probes; variants.,Mathieu Gand;Kevin Vanneste;Isabelle Thomas;Steven Van Gucht;Arnaud Capron;Philippe Herman;Nancy H C Roosens;Sigrid C J De Keersmaecker

One clear difference between these pandemics has been the ability to test for the presence of the virus or for evidence of infection. This review examined the performance characteristics of sample types via PCR detection of the virus, of antibody testing, of rapid viral antigen detection kits and computerised tomography (CT) scanning. It was found that combined detection approaches, such as the incorporation of CT scans, may reduce the levels of false negatives obtained by PCR detection in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, while sputum and oral throat washing sample types should take precedence over swabbing when available. Rt-PCR assays for detection of the virus remain the gold-standard method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and can be used effectively on pooled samples for widespread screening. The novel Oxford antibody assay was found to have the highest sensitivity and specificity of four currently available commercial antibody kits but should only be used during a specific timeframe post-symptom onset. Further research into transmission modes between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients is needed. Analysis of the performance characteristics of different sampling and detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 showed that timing of sampling and testing methods used can greatly influence the rate of false-positive and false-negative test results, thereby influencing viral spread.",COVID-19; Rt-PCR; SARS-CoV-2; antibody tests; antigen tests; asymptomatic; detection methods; diagnosis; sampling; symptomatic.,Daniel Keaney;Shane Whelan;Karen Finn;Brigid Lucey

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33851739/,Comparison of saliva with oral and nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 detection on various commercial and laboratory-developed assays,"The accurate laboratory detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a crucial element in the fight against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing on combined oral and nasopharyngeal swab (ONPS) suffers from several limitations, including the need for qualified personnel, the discomfort caused by invasive nasopharyngeal sample collection, and the possibility of swab and transport media shortage. Testing on saliva would represent an advancement. The aim of this study was to compare the concordance between saliva samples and ONPS for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 on various commercial and laboratory-developed tests (LDT). Individuals were recruited from eight institutions in Quebec, Canada, if they had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected on a recently collected ONPS, and accepted to provide another ONPS, paired with saliva. Assays available in the different laboratories (Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2, Cobas® SARS-CoV-2, Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct, Allplex™ 2019-nCoV, RIDA®GENE SARS-CoV-2, and an LDT preceded by three different extraction methods) were used to determine the concordance between saliva and ONPS results. Overall, 320 tests were run from a total of 125 saliva and ONPS sample pairs. All assays yielded similar sensitivity when saliva was compared to ONPS, with the exception of one LDT (67% vs. 93%). The mean difference in cycle threshold (∆C t ) was generally (but not significantly) in favor of the ONPS for all nucleic acid amplification tests. The maximum mean ∆C t was 2.0, while individual ∆C t varied importantly from -17.5 to 12.4.

Contact tracing and surveillance are important to locate cases in the community, including asymptomatic individuals. Diagnosis of COVID-19 depends on the detection of viral RNA, viral antigen, or indirectly, viral antibodies. Molecular diagnosis, using real time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the common standard method; however, it is not widely available in Indonesia and requires a high standard laboratory. Rapid, point-of-care antibody testing has been widely used as an alternative; however, interpretation of the results is not simple and now it is no longer used by the Indonesian government as a screening test for people travelling between locations. Thus, the rapid antigen detection test (Ag-RDT) is used by the Indonesian government as a screening test for travellers. As a result, many people buy the kit online and perform self-Ag-RDT at home. This raises the question of how safe and accurate it is to perform self-Ag-RDT at home. Before a test is applied, it is suggested to research its sensitivity and specificity, as compared to gold standard, and its limitations.

Standard molecular diagnostic laboratory equipment, and commercially available centrifugal filters, RNA isolation kits and SARS Cov2 PCR tests were used. The basic idea was to combine and concentrate several samples to the maximal volume, which can be extracted with the single extraction column. Out of 16 tested pools, 12 were positive with cycle threshold (Ct) values within 0.5 and 3.01 Ct of the original individual specimens. The analysis of 112 specimens determined that 12 pools were positive, followed by identification of 6 positive individual specimens among the 112 tested. This testing was accomplished with the use of 16 extractions/PCR tests, resulting in saving of 96 reactions but adding the 40 centrifugal filters.

While RT-PCR tests performed in centralized laboratories remain the gold standard, rapid point-of-care antigen tests might provide faster results. However, they are associated with markedly reduced sensitivity. Bedside breath gas analysis of volatile organic compounds detected by ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) may enable a quick and sensitive point-of-care testing alternative. In this proof-of-concept study, we investigated whether gas analysis by IMS can discriminate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from other respiratory viruses in an experimental set-up. Repeated gas analyses of air samples collected from the headspace of virus-infected in vitro cultures were performed for 5 days. A three-step decision tree using the intensities of four spectrometry peaks correlating to unidentified volatile organic compounds allowed the correct classification of SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus-NL63, and influenza A virus H1N1 without misassignment when the calculation was performed with data 3 days post infection. The forward selection assignment model allowed the identification of SARS-CoV-2 with high sensitivity and specificity, with only one of 231 measurements (0.43%) being misclassified. Thus, volatile organic compound analysis by IMS allows highly accurate differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 from other respiratory viruses in an experimental set-up, supporting further research and evaluation in clinical studies.",,M Feuerherd;A-K Sippel;J Erber;J I Baumbach;R M Schmid;U Protzer;F Voit;C D Spinner

The sensitivity of these tests heavily depends on the viral load, extrapolated by the threshold cycle (Ct). It is therefore essential to verify their performance before their inclusion in routine. The Coronavirus Ag Rapid Test Cassette Bio-Rad, the GSD NovaGen SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Antigen Rapid Test, and the Aegle Coronavirus Ag Rapid Test Cassette were evaluated on 199 samples: 150 fresh samples from the routine and positive in quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), nine fresh samples negative in RT-qPCR, and 40 frozen samples, taken before the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 but positive for other respiratory viruses. Positive RT-qPCR samples were categorized according to their Ct: Ct < 20 (18.7%), ≥ 20-< 25 (27.3%), ≥ 25-< 30 (18.7%), ≥ 30-35 (17.3%), and > 35 (18.0%).

Among samples with previously diagnosed viruses, seven false-positive results were found with GSD NovaGen only (specificity 85.7%). Equivalent, high sensitivities were observed with the highest viral load samples. The GSD NovaGen assay showed less specificity.

Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS, n = 220) were tested by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and with the LAMP assay. For RT-PCR, NA were investigated. For LAMP, NA from 26 NPS in viral transport medium (VTM) were tested. The other 194 NPS were analyzed directly without prior NA extraction (140 samples in VTM; 54 dry swab samples stirred in phosphate buffered saline). Ten NPS were tested directly by LAMP using a sous-vide cooking unit. The isothermal assay demonstrated excellent specificity (100%) but moderate sensitivity (68.8%), with a positive predictive value of 1 and a negative predictive value of 0.65 for direct testing of NPS in VTM. The use of dry swabs, even without NA extraction, improved the analytical sensitivity; up to 6% of samples showed signs of inhibition. LAMP could be performed successfully with a sous-vide cooking unit. This technique is very fast, requires little laboratory resources, and can replace rapid antigen tests or verify reactive rapid tests on-site.",COVID-19; LAMP; RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2; direct testing; loop-mediated isothermal amplification; nucleic acids.,Olympia E Anastasiou;Caroline Holtkamp;Miriam Schäfer;Frieda Schön;Anna Maria Eis-Hübinger;Andi Krumbholz

The relevance and importance of mass diagnosis in order to find the asymptomatic individuals is widely recognized as a mandatory tool to reinforce the control measures for monitoring virus circulation and reduce the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we described quickness and cheaper strategies of direct RT-qPCR (in the absence of RNA isolation) and compared the results to those obtained using standard RNA isolation procedure. The tests varied using pure, diluted samples, combined with Proteinase K (PK) or Lysis Buffer. Our findings showed consistently that PK pre-treated samples in the absence of RNA extraction procedures presents similar results to those obtained by standard RNA isolation procedures. On average, 16 samples extracted with the MagMAX™ CORE Kit, take around 2 h, costing an average of USD 5, the pre-treatment of samples using PK, on the other hand, would cut the value to less than USD 0.30 and reduce the time of procedure in more than 1 ½ hours.

Important respiratory viruses that will need to be closely monitored during this time include SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and influenza B. The epidemiology of these viruses is very similar in terms of susceptible populations, mode of transmission, and the clinical syndromes, thus the etiological agent will be difficult to differentiate without target specific assays. The availability of a sensitive and specific multiplex assay that can simultaneously detect all these targets will be valuable. Here we report the validation of a real-time reverse transciptase-PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and influenza B. This multiplex assay is comparable to its singleplex counterparts with a limit-of-detection being less than 5 copies/reaction, 100 % specificity, over seven logs of dynamic range, less than 1 % coefficientof variation showing high precision, and equivalent accuracy using patient samples.

Recently, we reported the development of a Bioelectric Recognition Assay-based biosensor able to detect the SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein expressed on the surface of the virus in just three minutes, with high sensitivity and selectivity. The working principle was established by measuring the change of the electric potential of membrane-engineered mammalian cells bearing the human chimeric spike S1 antibody after attachment of the respective viral protein. In the present study, we applied the novel biosensor to patient-derived nasopharyngeal samples in a clinical set-up, with absolutely no sample pretreatment. More importantly, membrane-engineered cells were pre-immobilized in a proprietary biomatrix, thus enabling their long-term preservation prior to use as well as significantly increasing their ease-of-handle as test consumables. The plug-and-apply novel biosensor was able to detect the virus in positive samples with a 92.8% success rate compared to RT-PCR. No false negative results were recorded.

Early and accurate identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is fundamental to combat the disease. Among the current diagnostic tests, real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the most reliable and frequently used method. Herein, we discuss the interpretation of RT-qPCR results relative to viral infectivity. Although nasopharyngeal swab samples are often used for RT-qPCR testing, they require collection by trained medical staff. Saliva samples are emerging as an inexpensive and efficient alternative for large-scale screening. Pooled-sample testing of saliva has been applied for mass screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Current policies recommend isolating people with borderline cycle threshold (Ct) values (35<Ct <40), despite these Ct values indicating minimal infection risk. We propose the new concept of a ""social cut-off"" Ct value and risk stratification based on the correlation of Ct with infectivity. We also describe the experience of RT-qPCR screening of saliva samples at our institution.

Articles were screened for relevance, then data were extracted, analysed, and synthesised.ResultsOf the 160 studies included for qualitative analysis, 84% (n = 135) investigated duration of positive RT-PCR tests only, 5% (n = 8) investigated duration of successful viral isolations, while 11% (n = 17) included measurements on both. There was significant heterogeneity in reported data. There was a prolonged time to viral clearance when deduced from RT-PCR tests compared with viral isolations (median: 26 vs 9 days).DiscussionFindings from this review support a minimum 10-day period of isolation but certain cases where virus was isolated after 10 days were identified.

We carried out a direct comparison of the analytical sensitivities of 14 conventional and three rapid RT-PCR assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The comparison was performed utilizing a certified reference material for SARS-CoV-2 RNA that was serially two-fold diluted in RNA storage solution. Our results show that the analytical sensitivities of the 17 assays varied within an 8-fold range (100-800 copies/mL). Moreover, a trend with some rapid assays yielding slightly higher analytical sensitivities (2- to 4-fold) compared with conventional assays was observed. We conclude that most of the RT-PCR assays can be used for routine COVID-19 diagnosis, but some assays with the poorest analytical sensitivities may lead to false-negative results when used to identify asymptomatic individuals who can carry a low viral load but still be infectious. These findings should be kept in mind when selecting high-sensitivity and rapid assays.",Analytical sensitivity; False-negative; Limit of detection; Reverse transcription PCR; SARS-CoV-2.,Xueliang Wang;Zhongqiang Huang;Jian Song;Yanqun Xiao;Hualiang Wang
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34373145/,Characteristics of US Blood Donors Testing Reactive for Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Prior to the Availability of Authorized Vaccines,"In the United States, many blood collection organizations initiated programs to test all blood donors for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, as a measure to increase donations and to assist in the identification of potential donors of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP). As a result, it was possible to investigate the characteristics of healthy blood donors who had previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2. We report the findings from all blood donations collected by the American Red Cross, representing 40% of the national blood supply covering 44 States, in order to characterize the seroepidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection among blood donors in the United States, prior to authorized vaccine availability. We performed an observational cohort study from June 15th to November 30th, 2020 on a population of 1.531 million blood donors tested for antibodies to the S1 spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2 by person, place, time, ABO group and dynamics of test reactivity, with additional information from a survey of a subset of those with reactive test results. The overall seroreactivity was 4.22% increasing from 1.18 to 9.67% (June 2020 - November 2020); estimated incidence was 11.6 per hundred person-years, 1.86-times higher than that based upon reported cases in the general population over the same period. In multivariable analyses, seroreactivity was highest in the Midwest (5.21%), followed by the South (4.43%), West (3.43%) and Northeast (2.90%). Seroreactivity was highest among donors aged 18-24 (Odds Ratio 3.02 [95% Confidence Interval 2.80-3.26] vs age >55), African-Americans and Hispanics (1.50 [1.24-1.80] and 2.12 [1.89-2.36], respectively, vs Caucasian). Group O frequency was 51.5% among nonreactive, but 46.1% among seroreactive donors (P< .0001). Of surveyed donors, 45% reported no COVID-19-related symptoms, but 73% among those unaware of testing. Signal levels of antibody tests were stable over 120 days or more and there was little evidence of reinfection. Evaluation of a large population of healthy, voluntary blood donors provided evidence of widespread and increasing SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and demonstrated that at least 45% of those previously infected were asymptomatic. Epidemiologic findings were similar to those among clinically reported cases.",Antibodies; Blood Group O; Blood donors; COVID-19; Demographics; Incidence; SARS-CoV-2; Symptoms.,Roger Y Dodd;Bryan R Spencer;Meng Xu;Gregory A Foster;Paula Saá;Jaye P Brodsky;Susan L Stramer
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34378966/,Precision Response to the Rise of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 Variant of Concern by Combining Novel PCR Assays and Genome Sequencing for Rapid Variant Detection and Surveillance,"SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) have emerged as a global threat to the COVID-19 pandemic response. We implemented a combined approach to quickly detect known VOCs while continuously monitoring for evolving mutations of the virus. To rapidly detect VOCs, two real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assays were designed and implemented, targeting the spike gene H69/V70 deletion and the N501Y mutation. The H69/V70 deletion and N501Y mutation assays demonstrated accuracies of 98.3% (95% CI 93.8 to 99.8) and 100% (95% CI 96.8 to 100), limits of detection of 1,089 and 294 copies/ml, and percent coefficients of variation of 0.08 to 1.16% and 0 to 2.72% for the two gene targets, respectively. No cross-reactivity with common respiratory pathogens was observed with either assay. Implementation of these tests allowed the swift escalation in testing for VOCs from 2.2% to ∼100% of all SARS-CoV-2-positive samples over 12 January to 9 February 2021, and resulted in the detection of a rapid rise of B.1.1.7 cases within the province of Alberta, Canada. A prospective comparison of the VOC assays to genome sequencing for the detection of B.1.1.7, combined detection of P.1 and B.1.351, and wild-type (i.e., non-VOC) lineages showed sensitivities of 98.2 to 100%, specificities of 98.9 to 100%, positive predictive values of 76.9% to 100%, and negative predictive values of 96 to 100%. Variant screening results inform sampling strategies for regular surveillance by genome sequencing, thus allowing rapid identification of known VOCs while continuously monitoring the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the province. IMPORTANCE Different strains, or variants, of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19) have emerged that have higher levels of transmission, less susceptibility to our immune response, and possibly cause more severe disease than previous strains of the virus. Rapid detection of these variants of concern is important to help contain them and prevent them from spreading widely within the population. This study describes two newly developed tests that are able to identify and differentiate the variants of concern from regular strains of SARS-CoV-2.

High-throughput detection methods for nucleic acids are emergently desired. Here, we show high-sensitivity and high-throughput metasurface fluorescence biosensors that are applicable for nucleic acid targets. The all-dielectric metasurface biosensors comprise silicon-on-insulator nanorod array and have prominent electromagnetic resonances enhancing fluorescence emission. For proof-of-concept experiment on the metasurface biosensors, we have conducted fluorescence detection of single-strand oligoDNAs, which model the partial sequences of SARS-CoV-2 RNA indicated by national infection institutes, and succeeded in the high-throughput detection at low concentrations on the order of 100 amol/mL without any amplification technique.

Following a proof-of-concept study conducted by Public Health Command-Pacific, Public Health Command-Europe was the first public health laboratory to offer the capability to assess for SARS-CoV-2 in pooled samples, followed closely by the Army Public Health Center (APHC) at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD, paralleling the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from China to Europe to the continental US. The APHLs have selected pool sizes of up to 10 samples per pool based on the best evidence available at the time of method development and validation. Real-Time quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) assays using RNA extracts from pooled nasopharyngeal swabs preserved in viral transport media were selected to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2. The rapid development of initial surveillance testing capabilities depended on existing equipment in each laboratory, with a plan to implement full operational capability using additional staff and common high-throughput platforms. APHL Enterprise has successfully used existing resources to begin to address the changing and complex needs for COVID-19 testing within the Army population.

The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the most used technique in virus detection. However, possible false-negative and false-positive results produce misleading consequences, making it necessary to improve existing methods. Here, we developed a multiplex rRT-PCR diagnostic method, which targets two viral genes (RdRP and E) and one human gene (RP) simultaneously. The reaction was tested by using pseudoviral RNA and human target mRNA sequences as a template. Also, the protocol was validated by using 14 clinical SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. The results are in good agreement with the CDC authorized Cepheid`s Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic system (100%). Unlike single gene targeting strategies, the current method provides the amplification of two viral regions in the same PCR reaction. Therefore, an accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assay was provided, which allows testing of 91 samples in 96-well plates in per run.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34004070/,A Multiplex One-Step RT-qPCR Protocol to Detect SARS-CoV-2 in NP/OP Swabs and Saliva,"Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has spread extensively throughout the world, with more than 117 million reported cases and 2.6 million deaths (Johns Hopkins coronavirus resource center, https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). Detecting the virus is the first step in diagnosing the infection, followed by quarantine to prevent transmission. Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs (NP/OP) and saliva are two specimen types that are most often analyzed to detect SARS-CoV-2 by molecular tests that detect viral RNA or by antigen/antibody tests that detect viral proteins and/or the host immune response against the virus. Compared to antigen/antibody tests, molecular tests are highly sensitive and specific for detecting the virus. A significant drawback is that specimen collection requirements are specific to each test and cannot be interchanged with another test. Some tests are qualified to be used on NP swabs or saliva, but not both specimen types. Even with NP swabs, a test may be qualified to detect the virus only with swabs collected in viral transport medium (VTM) but not in other media. These restrictive pre-analytic steps are disadvantageous in that a lab would have to develop and validate different tests for SARS-CoV-2 depending on the specimen type and collection media, with added setup cost, infrastructure, and training requirements. To overcome these problems, we developed and validated a cost-effective multiplex reverse-transcription real-time PCR assay that can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in different specimen types. The assay is highly sensitive and specific, can be used to detect the virus in saliva as well as NP swabs collected in different media such as VTM, saline, and commercial preservative fluid, and serves as one test for all applications. The protocol also describes an optimal laboratory setup and unidirectional workflow for detecting SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. © 2021 The Authors. Current Protocols published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34354202/,Real-time SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic and variants tracking over multiple candidates using nanopore DNA sequencing,"Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus responsible for a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is accountable for a major pandemic situation. The emergence of the B.1.1.7 strain, as a highly transmissible variant has accelerated the world-wide interest in tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants' occurrence. Similarly, other extremely infectious variants, were described and further others are expected to be discovered due to the long period of time on which the pandemic situation is lasting. All described SARS-CoV-2 variants present several mutations within the gene encoding the Spike protein, involved in host receptor recognition and entry into the cell. Hence, instead of sequencing the whole viral genome for variants' tracking, herein we propose to focus on the SPIKE region to increase the number of candidate samples to screen at once; an essential aspect to accelerate diagnostics, but also variants' emergence/progression surveillance. This proof of concept study accomplishes both at once, population-scale diagnostics and variants' tracking. This strategy relies on (1) the use of the portable MinION DNA sequencer; (2) a DNA barcoding and a SPIKE gene-centered variant's tracking, increasing the number of candidates per assay; and (3) a real-time diagnostics and variant's tracking monitoring thanks to our software RETIVAD. This strategy represents an optimal solution for addressing the current needs on SARS-CoV-2 progression surveillance, notably due to its affordable implementation, allowing its implantation even in remote places over the world.",,François Stüder;Jean-Louis Petit;Stefan Engelen;Marco Antonio Mendoza-Parra

Several sample-to-answer platforms, including Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Xpert Xpress), have received emergency use authorization for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection as a point of care test in the United States. However, their application niche is unclear when compared with real-time RT-PCR assays cleared by the National Medical Products Administration in China. In this study, the clinical performance, sensitivity, and workflow of Xpert Xpress and two real-time RT-PCR kits (BioGerm kit and Sansure kit) were evaluated by the specimens from 86 symptomatic patients. The positive percent agreement of Xpert Xpress was 100% compared with 96.15% for the BioGerm kit and 90% for the Sansure kit. The negative percent agreement was 100% for all three assays. The limit of detection is 100 copies/mL for Xpert Xpress and 500 copies/mL for the BioGerm kit and Sansure kit. By serially diluting five positive specimens, the Xpert Xpress had better detection capability. In the workflow and throughput analysis, the turnaround time was 51 minutes for Xpert Xpress, 150 minutes for the BioGerm kit, and 210 minutes for the Sansure kit.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34493744/,Implementation of an efficient SARS-CoV-2 specimen pooling strategy for high throughput diagnostic testing,"The rapid identification and isolation of infected individuals remains a key strategy for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Frequent testing of populations to detect infection early in asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals can be a powerful tool for intercepting transmission, especially when the viral prevalence is low. However, RT-PCR testing-the gold standard of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis-is expensive, making regular testing of every individual unfeasible. Sample pooling is one approach to lowering costs. By combining samples and testing them in groups the number of tests required is reduced, substantially lowering costs. Here we report on the implementation of pooling strategies using 3-d and 4-d hypercubes to test a professional sports team in South Africa. We have shown that infected samples can be reliably detected in groups of 27 and 81, with minimal loss of assay sensitivity for samples with individual Ct values of up to 32. We report on the automation of sample pooling, using a liquid-handling robot and an automated web interface to identify positive samples. We conclude that hypercube pooling allows for the reliable RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, at significantly lower costs than lateral flow antigen (LFA) tests.",,Lavanya Singh;Ugochukwu J Anyaneji;Wilfred Ndifon;Neil Turok;Stacey A Mattison;Richard Lessells;Ilya Sinayskiy;Emmanuel J San;Houriiyah Tegally;Shaun Barnett;Trevor Lorimer;Francesco Petruccione;Tulio de Oliveira

Commercial one-step master mixes-which include both a reverse transcriptase and a thermostable polymerase and thus allow performing both the RT and qPCR steps consecutively in a sealed well-are key reagents for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing; yet, these are typically expensive and have been affected by supply shortages in periods of high demand. As an alternative, we describe here how to express and purify Taq polymerase and M-MLV reverse transcriptase and assemble a homemade one-step RT-qPCR master mix. This mix can be easily assembled from scratch in any laboratory equipped for protein purification. We also describe two simple alternative methods to prepare clinical swab samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by RT-qPCR: heat-inactivation for direct addition, and concentration of RNA by isopropanol precipitation. Finally, we describe how to perform RT-qPCR using the homemade master mix, how to prepare in vitro-transcribed RNA standards, and how to use a fluorescence imager for endpoint detection of RT-PCR amplification in the absence of a qPCR machine In addition to being useful for diagnostics, these versatile protocols may be adapted for nucleic acid quantification in basic research. © 2021 The Authors.

This observational study was conducted in a Model 4 tertiary referral center in Ireland. All patients referred for SARS-CoV-2 assessment over a 4-week period were included. Patient demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities, medications, and outcomes (including length of stay, discharge, and mortality) were collected. Two hundred and seventy-nine patients were assessed. These patients were predominantly female (62%) with a median age of 50 years (SD 16.9). Nineteen (6.8%) patients had SARS-CoV-2 detected. Dysgeusia was associated with a 16-fold increased prediction of SARS-CoV-2 positivity (p = .001; OR, 16.8; 95% CI, 3.82-73.84). Thirteen patients with SARS-COV-2 detected (68.4%) were admitted, in contrast with 38.1% (99/260) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 non-detectable or not tested (p = .001). Female patients were more likely to be hospitalized (p = .01) as were current and ex-smokers (p = .05).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33640656/,Emulsion-based isothermal nucleic acid amplification for rapid SARS-CoV-2 detection via angle-dependent light scatter analysis,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, an ongoing global health crisis, has revealed the need for new technologies that integrate the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR tests with a faster time-to-detection. Here, an emulsion loop-mediated isothermal amplification (eLAMP) platform was developed to allow for the compartmentalization of LAMP reactions, leading to faster changes in emulsion characteristics, and thus lowering time-to-detection. Within these droplets, ongoing LAMP reactions lead to adsorption of amplicons to the water-oil interface, causing a decrease in interfacial tension, resulting in smaller emulsion diameters. Changes in emulsion diameter allow for the monitoring of the reaction by use of angle-dependent light scatter (based off Mie scatter theory). Mie scatter simulations confirmed that light scatter intensity is diameter-dependent and smaller colloids have lower intensity values compared to larger colloids. Via spectrophotometers and fiber optic cables placed at 30° and 60°, light scatter intensity was monitored. Scatter intensities collected at 5 min, 30° could statistically differentiate 10, 103, and 105 copies/μL initial concentrations compared to NTC. Similarly, 5 min scatter intensities collected at 60° could statistically differentiate 105 copies/μL initial concentrations in comparison to NTC. The use of both angles during the eLAMP assay allows for distinction between high and low initial target concentrations. The efficacy of a smartphone-based platform was also tested and had a similar limit of detection and assay time of less than 10 min. Furthermore, fluorescence-labeled primers were used to validate target nucleic acid amplification. Compared to existing LAMP assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection, these times-to-detections are very rapid.",COVID-19; Emulsion; Interfacial tension; Loop-mediated isothermal amplification; Mie scatter; SARS-CoV-2.,Alexander S Day;Tiffany-Heather Ulep;Babak Safavinia;Tyler Hertenstein;Elizabeth Budiman;Laurel Dieckhaus;Jeong-Yeol Yoon
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33635936/,Extraction-free protocol combining proteinase K and heat inactivation for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR,"Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is the gold-standard technique for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection in nasopharyngeal swabs specimens. The analysis by RT-qPCR usually requires a previous extraction step to obtain the purified viral RNA. Unfortunately, RNA extraction constitutes a bottleneck for early detection in many countries since it is expensive, time-consuming and depends on the availability of commercial kits. Here, we describe an extraction-free protocol for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR from nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples in saline solution. The method includes a treatment with proteinase K followed by heat inactivation (PK+HID method). We demonstrate that PK+HID improves the RT-qPCR performance in comparison to the heat-inactivation procedure. Moreover, we show that this extraction-free protocol can be combined with a variety of multiplexing RT-qPCR kits. The method combined with a multiplexing detection kit targeting N and ORF1ab viral genes showed a sensitivity of 0.99 and a specificity of 0.99 from the analysis of 106 positive and 106 negative clinical samples.

The glucose test strip permits the collection, shipment, and analysis of 0.6 μL of whole blood easily obtainable from a simple finger prick. The NIA platform achieves high throughput, high sensitivity, and specificity based on the analysis of 289 human serum samples, and negligible reagent consumption.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33730407/,"A simple, safe and sensitive method for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation and RNA extraction for RT-qPCR","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created an urgent need for diagnostic tests to detect viral RNA. Commercial RNA extraction kits are often expensive, in limited supply, and do not always fully inactivate the virus. Together, this calls for the development of safer methods for SARS-CoV-2 extraction that utilize readily available reagents and equipment present in most standard laboratories. We optimized and simplified a RNA extraction method combining a high molar acidic guanidinium isothiocyanate (GITC) solution, phenol and chloroform. First, we determined the GITC/RNA dilution thresholds compatible with an efficient two-step RT-qPCR for B2M mRNA in nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swab samples. Second, we optimized a one-step RT-qPCR against SARS-CoV-2 using NP and OP samples. We furthermore tested a SARS-CoV-2 dilution series to determine the detection threshold. The method enables downstream detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR with high sensitivity (~4 viral RNA copies per RT-qPCR). The protocol is simple, safe, and expands analysis capacity as the inactivated samples can be used in RT-qPCR detection tests at laboratories not otherwise classified for viral work. The method takes about 30 min from swab to PCR-ready viral RNA and circumvents the need for commercial RNA purification kits.",RNA extraction; RT-qPCR; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR; clinical microbiology; molecular microbiology; rapid diagnostic methods; virology; virus inactivation.,Lelde Kalnina;Àngels Mateu-Regué;Stephanie Oerum;Annemette Hald;Jan Gerstoft;Henrik Oerum;Finn Cilius Nielsen;Astrid K N Iversen

SARS-CoV-2-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), which can identify SARS-CoV-2 from common human coronaviruses, are considered to extensively apply to developing rapid and reliable antigen assays. In this study we generated a rabbit MAb (RAb) detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP), which has cross-reaction with SARS-CoV-1 NP, but not with NPs of MERS and common human CoVs (OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1). With truncated NP fragments and synthesized peptides, the linear epitope detected by RAb was mapped in peptide N4-8, 393-407 amino acid residue (TLLPAADLDDFSKQL) of SARS-CoV-2 NP. This epitope N4-8 was highly conserved in SARSr-CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and bat CoV RaTG13 strain. However, the corresponding peptide of bat SARSr-CoV BtKY72 strain could not be recognized by RAb, which indicates amino acid D399 may be critical for N4-8 epitope detected by RAb.

Saliva could be a potential alternative specimen source for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR).Aim. To compare the detection efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva and oro-nasopharyngeal swab (ONPS) specimens.Methodology. Patients recruited from hospital provided paired saliva and ONPS specimens. We performed manual or automated RT-PCR with prior proteinase K treatment without RNA extraction using the Seegene Allplex 2019 nCoV assay.Results. Of the 773 specimen pairs, 165 (21.3 %) had at least one positive sample. Additionally, 138 specimens tested positive by both sampling methods. Fifteen and 12 cases were detected only by nasopharyngeal swab and saliva, respectively. The sensitivity of ONPS (153/165; 92.7 %; 95 % CI: 88.8-96.7) was similar to that of saliva (150/165; 90.9 %; 95 % CI: 86.5-95.3; P=0.5).

Statistical modelling generated optimised assay cut-off thresholds. Sensitivity of Euroimmun-anti-S1-IgA was 64.8%, specificity 93.3% (manufacturer's cut-off); for Euroimmun-anti-S1-IgG, sensitivity was 77.2/79.8% (manufacturer's/optimised cut-offs), specificity 98.0/97.8%; Roche-anti-N sensitivity was 85.5/88.6%, specificity 99.8/99.7%. In true-positives, mean and median Euroimmun-anti-S1-IgA and -IgG titres decreased 30/90 days after RT-PCR-positivity, Roche-anti-N titres decreased significantly later. Virus-neutralisation was 80.6% sensitive, 100.0% specific (≥1:5 dilution). Neutralisation surrogate tests (GeneScriptcPass, Mikrogen-recomLine-RBD) were >94.9% sensitive and >98.1% specific. Optimised cut-offs improved test performances of several tests. Confirmatory testing with virus-neutralisation might be complemented with GeneScriptcPassTM or recomLine-RBD for certain applications.

PCR and serological testing was performed on 394 individuals. SARS-CoV-2-IgG seroprevalence was 42.9% (95% CI 38.1-47.8%), 40.6% (95% CI 35.9-45.5%), and 42.4% (95% CI 37.6-47.3%) using the CL-900i, VidasIII, and Elecsys assays, respectively.

Among all individuals, 12.5% (95% CI 9.6-16.1%) had current infection, as assessed by PCR. Of these, only 34.7% (95% CI 22.9-48.7%) were seropositive by at least one assay. A total of 216 individuals (54.8%; 95% CI 49.9-59.7%) had evidence of ever infection using antibody testing and/or PCR during or prior to this study. Of these, only 78.2%, 74.1%, and 77.3% were seropositive in the CL-900i, VidasIII, and Elecsys assays, respectively.

Whether the use of disinfectants affect the results of viral nucleic acid amplification is unknown. We examined the impact of different hypochlorous acid (HOCl) concentrations on the quantitative results of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We also explored the mechanisms and models of action of chlorine-containing disinfectants that affected the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The results showed that different HOCl concentrations and different action times had an impact on the SARS-CoV-2 results. High concentrations of ambient HOCl have a greater impact than low concentrations, and this effect will increase with the extension of the action time and with the increase in ambient humidity. Compared with the enzymes or the extracted RNA required for RT-PCR, the impact of HOCl on the SARS-CoV-2 detection is more likely to be caused by damage to primers and probes in the PCR system. The false negative result still existed after changing the ambient disinfectant to ethanol but not peracetic acid. The use of HOCl in the environment will have an unpredictable impact on the nucleic acid test results of SARS-CoV-2. In order to reduce the possibility of false negative of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test and prevent the spread of epidemic disease, environmental disinfectants should be used at the beginning and end of the experiment rather than during the experimental operation.",Disinfectant; Hypochlorous acid; Nucleic acid amplification testing; SARS-CoV-2.,Xiuzhi Duan;Xuchu Wang;Yiyi Xie;Pan Yu;Tingting Zhuang;Yingzhi Zhang;Liuyu Fang;Ying Ping;Weiwei Liu;Zhihua Tao
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34003878/,Pool testing on random and natural clusters of individuals: Optimisation of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in the presence of low viral load samples,"Facing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic requires intensive testing on the population to early identify and isolate infected subjects. During the first emergency phase of the epidemic, RT-qPCR on nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, which is the most reliable technique to detect ongoing infections, exhibited limitations due to availability of reagents and budget constraints. This stressed the need to develop screening procedures that require fewer resources and are suitable to be extended to larger portions of the population. RT-qPCR on pooled samples from individual NP swabs seems to be a promising technique to improve surveillance. We performed preliminary experimental analyses aimed to investigate the performance of pool testing on samples with low viral load and we evaluated through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations alternative screening protocols based on sample pooling, tailored to contexts characterized by different infection prevalence. We focused on the role of pool size and the opportunity to develop strategies that take advantage of natural clustering structures in the population, e.g. families, school classes, hospital rooms. Despite the use of a limited number of specimens, our results suggest that, while high viral load samples seem to be detectable even in a pool with 29 negative samples, positive specimens with low viral load may be masked by the negative samples, unless smaller pools are used. The results of MC simulations confirm that pool testing is useful in contexts where the infection prevalence is low. The gain of pool testing in saving resources can be very high, and can be optimized by selecting appropriate group sizes. Exploiting natural groups makes the definition of larger pools convenient and potentially overcomes the issue of low viral load samples by increasing the probability of identifying more than one positive in the same pool.",,Michela Baccini;Emilia Rocco;Irene Paganini;Alessandra Mattei;Cristina Sani;Giulia Vannucci;Simonetta Bisanzi;Elena Burroni;Marco Peluso;Armelle Munnia;Filippo Cellai;Giampaolo Pompeo;Laura Micio;Jessica Viti;Fabrizia Mealli;Francesca Maria Carozzi

In this study, a high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MMIA) was developed for the receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (N) that was more sensitive than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (98% versus 87%). The MMIA was then applied and validated in 264 first responders in Colorado using serum and dried blood spot (DBS) eluates, compared to ELISA, and evaluated for neutralizing antibodies. Four percent (11/264) of first responders were seropositive in July to August 2020. Serum and DBS were highly correlated for anti-RBD and anti-N antibodies (R = 0.83, P < 0.0001 and R = 0.87, P < 0.0001, respectively) by MMIA. The MMIA accurately predicted SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies using DBS (R = 0.76, P = 0.037). On repeat antibody testing 3 months later, anti-RBD IgG decreased less rapidly than anti-N IgG measured by MMIA, with a median change in geometric median fluorescence intensity of 62% versus 79% (P < 0.01) for anti-RBD and anti-N IgG, respectively. This novel MMIA using DBS could be scalable for rapid and affordable SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance in the United States and globally.",COVID-19 antibody testing; SARS-CoV-2 infection serological testing; dried blood spot testing; enzyme immunoassay; immunological surveillance.,Jonathan S Schultz;Mary K McCarthy;Cody Rester;Katherine R Sabourin;Kyle Annen;Melkon DomBourian;Elan Eisenmesser;Ashley Frazer-Abel;Vijaya Knight;Thomas Jaenisch;Thomas E Morrison;Rosemary Rochford;Ross M Kedl
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34370919/,"[A proposal for the management of health surveillance and monitoring procedures in relation to the risks posed by SARS-COV-2 to hospital and nursing home workers, based on strategies implemented in the facilities of the Fondazione Opera San Camillo]","This paper describes how the health surveillance protocols adopted in hospitals and nursing homes have changed in response to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its risks. These changes concern assessments that must be performed with urgency, to detect potential cases and symptoms that may indicate contagion and to protect vulnerable and hypersensitive workers. Besides, these changes have been implemented in order to regulate how the appointed occupational physician should perform everyday tasks, particularly in regard to preventive visits, periodic visits, office visits, and visits meant to authorize one's return to the workplace. This paper recommends that both preventive visits and periodic visits should include rapid antigen swab tests to screen for SARS-CoV-2 (which, if positive, should be confirmed by molecular tests) and serologic tests to detect IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Since this phase involves great risks for healthcare facilities, this paper proposes that swab testing should be performed every month and that serologic testing should be performed every three months (depending on whether the first test detects the presence of IgG antibodies). By combining antigen and molecular swab tests, healthcare professionals can diagnose workers with SARS-CoV-2 and identify positive asymptomatic cases. Because of its costs and its long turnaround times for results, molecular swab testing is recommended only when one needs to confirm a positive antigen swab test result. Serologic testing should be used alongside swab testing, to acquire data concerning the immunity of workers.",,Gianni Saretto;Carla Bozzi

The protocol used Charité's nucleocapsid (Sarbeco-N) and NIID nucleocapsid (NIID-N2) assays. During the following months, SARS-CoV-2 spread and caused a global pandemic, and various SARS-CoV-2 sequences were registered in public databases, such as the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). In this study, we evaluated the S2 assay (NIID-S2) that was newly developed to replace the Sarbeco-N assay and the performance of the NIID-N2 and NIID-S2 assays, referring to mismatches in the primer/probe targeted region. We found that the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the NIID-S2 set were comparable to those of the NIID-N2 assay, and the detection rate for clinical specimens was identical to that of the NIID-N2 assay. Furthermore, among the available sequences (approximately 192,000), the NIID-N2 and NIID-S2 sets had 2.6% and 1.2% mismatched sequences, respectively, although most of these mismatches did not affect the amplification efficiency, except the 3' end of the NIID-N2 forward primer. These findings indicate that the previously developed NIID-N2 assay is suitable for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 with support from the newly developed NIID-S2 set.",coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); real-time RT-PCR; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).,Kazuya Shirato;Yuriko Tomita;Hiroshi Katoh;Souichi Yamada;Shuetsu Fukushi;Shutoku Matsuyama;Makoto Takeda

Diagnostic laboratories are expected to provide appropriate testing with maximum accuracy. Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) is the diagnostic standard. However, only a handful of studies have reviewed their performance in clinical settings. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of the overall analytical matrix including the extraction kit (BD MAX, Promega, Qiagen), the PCR instrument (Agilent Mx3005 P, BD MAX, Qiagen Rotor-Gene, Roche Cobas z 480) and the RT-PCR assay (Altona Diagnostics, CerTest Biotec, R-Biopharm AG) using predefined samples from proficiency testing organizers. The greatest difference of the cycle threshold values between the matrices was nine cycles. One borderline sample could not be detected by three out of twelve analytical matrices and yielded a false negative result. We therefore conclude that diagnostic laboratories should take the complete analytical matrix in addition to the performance values published by the manufacturer for a respective RT-PCR kit into account. With limited resources laboratories have to validate a wide range of kits to determine appropriate analytical matrices for detecting SARS-CoV-2 reliably.

While cases continue to rise, there is an urgent need to deploy sensitive and rapid testing in order to identify potential outbreaks before there is an opportunity for further community spread. Currently, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is considered the gold standard for diagnosing an active infection, using a nasopharyngeal swab; however, it can take days after symptoms develop to properly identify and trace the infection. While many civilian jobs can be performed remotely, the Department of Defense (DOD) is by nature a very fluid organization which requires in-person interaction and a physical presence to maintain effectiveness.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33640711/,RNase in the saliva can affect the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by real-time one-step polymerase chain reaction using saliva samples,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a single-stranded RNA virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019, which spread worldwide immediately after the first patient infected with this virus was discovered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specimens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 include saliva, nasopharyngeal swabs, and lower respiratory tract-derived materials such as sputum. Initially, nasopharyngeal swab specimens were applied mainly to the PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. There was a risk of infection to healthcare workers due to coughing or sneezing by the subjects at the time of sample collection. In contrast, saliva specimens have a low risk of droplet infection and are easy to collect, and their application to PCR testing has been promoted. In this study, we have determined the detection limit of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples and examined the effects of storage temperature and storage time of saliva samples on the PCR detection results. As a result, 5 × 103 copies of SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in 1 mL phosphate-buffered saline, whereas 5 × 104 copies of SARS-CoV-2 were needed in 1 mL saliva to detect the virus by real-time one-step PCR. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 (5 × 103 copies/mL) could be detected in saliva supplemented with an RNase inhibitor. Concerning the saliva samples supplemented with an RNase inhibitor, the optimal temperature for sample storage was -20 °C, and PCR detection was maintained within 48 h without problems under these conditions.

In this study, SARS-CoV-2 detectability by RT-PCR was assessed after prolonged unfrozen storage or repetitive freeze-thawing of SARS-CoV-2 samples. SARS-CoV-2-positive patient swabs stored in viral transport medium were exposed to different temperatures (4°C, 25°C, and 35°C) and to repetitive freeze-thawing, to assess the effect of storage conditions on RT-PCR detection. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was still reliably detected by RT-PCR after 21 days of storage in viral transport medium, even when the samples had been stored at 35°C. The maximum observed change in cycle threshold value per day was 0.046 (±0.019) at 35°C, and the maximum observed change in cycle threshold value per freeze-thaw cycle per day was 0.197 (±0.06).

A novel in-house Coronavirus protein microarray showed differing SARS-CoV-2 protein reactivities and helped define likely true positives vs. suspected false positives. Our study demonstrates the utility of routine screening of asymptomatic HCWs, which may help to identify a significant proportion of infections.",,Victor H Ferreira;Andrzej Chruscinski;Vathany Kulasingam;Trevor J Pugh;Tamara Dus;Brad Wouters;Amit Oza;Matthew Ierullo;Terrance Ku;Beata Majchrzak-Kita;Sonika T Humar;Ilona Bahinskaya;Natalia Pinzon;Jianhua Zhang;Lawrence E Heisler;Paul M Krzyzanowski;Bernard Lam;Ilinca M Lungu;Dorin Manase;Krista M Pace;Pouria Mashouri;Michael Brudno;Michael Garrels;Tony Mazzulli;Myron Cybulsky;Atul Humar;Deepali Kumar
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34379377/,Early Identification of SARS-CoV-2 Emergence in the Department of Defense via Retrospective Analysis of 2019-2020 Upper Respiratory Illness Samples,"The first U.S. case of non-travel-related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was detected in late February 2020 in California, but the prevailing delay in diagnostic testing and initial stringent testing criteria made it difficult to identify those who could have acquired the virus through community spread. The emergence of the virus in the western Pacific region in late 2019 and the global distribution of Department of Defense (DoD) personnel present the risk that DoD members may have been exposed and contracted the virus earlier then U.S. detections. Here, a retrospective study from residual samples collected from a global DoD Respiratory Surveillance Program was conducted to establish a tentative timeline of when this virus began circulating in the DoD population. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed and the specimen collection dates of positive results were compared to the dates of the first infections previously identified in respective states and counties. Twenty-four positive samples were identified out of approximately 7,000 tested. Although this retrospective testing found early cases in 8 locations, there were no results indicative of circulation before late February.",,Richard R Chapleau;Monica Christian;Benjamin Connors;Christa Premo;Tim C Chao;Juan Rodriguez;Shana Huntsberger;Jennifer Meyer;Amanda Javorina;Kenney Reynolds;David Riddle;Mark Lisanby;Clarise Starr
