https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30228871/,Understanding myocardial infarction,"Over the last 40 years, our understanding of the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction has evolved and allowed new treatment strategies that have greatly improved survival. Over the years, there has been a radical shift in therapy from passive healing of the infarction through weeks of bed rest to early discharge usually within 2 to 3 days as a result of immediate reperfusion strategies and other guideline-directed medical therapies. Nevertheless, challenges remain. Patients who develop cardiogenic shock still face a high 30-day mortality of at least 40%. Perhaps even more important is how do we identify and prevent patients from developing myocardial infarction in the first place? This article discusses these milestones of therapy and considers important issues for progress in the future.",CAD; Myocardial Infarction; cardiogenic shock.,Moussa Saleh;John A Ambrose

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31902409/,Acute Myocardial Infarction in Young Individuals,"Globally, cardiovascular disease remains a major cause of adverse outcomes in young individuals, unlike its decline in other age groups. This group is not well studied and has a unique risk profile with less traditional cardiovascular risk factors compared with older populations. Plaque rupture still remains the most common etiology of myocardial infarction, but unique syndromes such as plaque erosion, coronary microvascular dysfunction, spontaneous coronary artery dissection, and coronary spasm related to drug use are more prevalent in this age group. Such diversity of diagnosis and presentation, along with therapeutic implications, underscore the need to study the profile of myocardial infarction in young persons. We searched PubMed for articles published from 1980 to 218 using the terms acute myocardial infarction, young, plaque rupture, plaque erosion, spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), coronary vasospasm, variant or Prinzmetal angina, drug-induced myocardial infarction, myocarditis, coronary embolism, microvascular dysfunction, MINOCA, and myocardial infarction in pregnancy and reviewed all the published studies. With the data from this search, we aim to inform readers of the prevalence, risk factors, presentation, and management of acute myocardial infarction in young patients and elaborate on special subgroups with diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25638347/,Myocardial Infarction: Symptoms and Treatments,"Myocardial infarction (MI) is a term used for an event of heart attack which is due to formation of plaques in the interior walls of the arteries resulting in reduced blood flow to the heart and injuring heart muscles because of lack of oxygen supply. The symptoms of MI include chest pain, which travels from left arm to neck, shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, vomiting, abnormal heart beating, anxiety, fatigue, weakness, stress, depression, and other factors. The immediate treatment of MI include, taking aspirin, which prevents blood from clotting, and nitro-glycerin to treat chest pain and oxygen. The heart attack can be prevented by taking an earlier action to lower those risks by controlling diet, fat, cholesterol, salt, smoking, nicotine, alcohol, drugs, monitoring of blood pressure every week, doing exercise every day, and loosing body weight. The treatment of MI includes, aspirin tablets, and to dissolve arterial blockage injection of thrombolytic or clot dissolving drugs such as tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase or urokinase in blood within 3 h of the onset of a heart attack. The painkillers such as morphine or meperidine can be administered to relieve pain. Nitroglycerin and antihypertensive drugs such as beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers may also be used to lower blood pressure and to improve the oxygen demand of heart. The ECG, coronary angiography and X-ray of heart and blood vessels can be performed to observe the narrowing of coronary arteries.

As with any MI subtype, there must be clinical evidence of myocardial ischemia to make the diagnosis. This condition is increasingly diagnosed due to the increasing sensitivity of cardiac troponin assays and is associated with adverse short-term and long-term prognoses. Limited data exist defining optimal management strategies because T2MI is a heterogeneous entity with varying etiologies and triggers. Thus, these patients require individualized care. A major barrier is the absence of a uniform definition that can be operationalized with high reproducibility. This document provides a synthesis of the data about T2MI to assist clinicians' understanding of its pathobiology, when to deploy the diagnosis, and its associated treatments.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31082987/,Type 2 myocardial infarction: a grim diagnosis with different shades of gray,": Type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) is commonly encountered in daily practice. Its incidence can range between 5 and 35% among all cases of MI. It is caused by disorders that result in supply-demand mismatch, which leads to myocardial ischemia and necrosis. Therefore, unsurprisingly, it is frequently diagnosed in critically ill patients and those with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) and multiple comorbidities. Though it can occur in the absence of CAD, the presence of coronary blood flow-limiting stenoses can allow even minor insults to disturb the already fine supply-demand balance. Generally, type 2 MI may be associated with higher mortality; however, some data suggest it may have different severities, and outcome is better in patients with type 2 MI of milder severity. Nonetheless, regardless of the causes (ischemic or nonischemic), troponin elevation is associated with worse outcome. Differentiating type 2 MI from other causes of myocardial necrosis, mainly type 1 MI and myocardial injury, remains a clinical challenge. Different diagnostic tools can be utilized to aid in reaching an accurate diagnosis. These can include contrast echocardiography, computed tomography, MRI, radionuclide imaging, coronary angiography, and intracoronary imaging. However, each comes with its own limitations and results should be interpreted with caution and in clinical context. Management of type 2 MI is uncertain because of paucity of data. Evidence-based therapies of type 1 MI are frequently used, though this may be harmful sometimes. Therefore, clinical judgment should be used, and management and therapies should be tailored to each individual case.",,Ali Dahhan

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33305709/,Myocardial Infarction with and without ST-segment Elevation: a Contemporary Reappraisal of Similarities and Differences,"Understanding the similarities and differences between myocardial infarction with or without ST-segment elevation is an essential step for proper patients' management in current practice. Both syndromes are caused by critical stenosis or total occlusion of coronary arteries (mostly due to thrombosis on atherosclerotic plaque), and manifest with a similar clinical presentation. Recent epidemiologic studies show that the relative incidence of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) moves in an opposite fashion (decreasing and increasing respectively), with a prognosis that is worse at short-term follow-up for STEMI but comparable at long-term. Current management differs, as for STEMIs, immediate reperfusion is recommended, while for NSTEMIs, risk stratification is mandatory in order to stratify patients' risk, and then decide the timing for coronary angiography. Periprocedural and technical aspects of the interventional management, as well as antithrombotic medications, are for the most similarly implemented in the two types of MI, with routine radial access, DES implant, and novel P2Y12 inhibitors representing the standard of care in both cases. The following review article aims to compare the two types of MI, with and without persistent STsegment elevation. The main purpose is to explore their similarities and differences and address areas of uncertainty with regards to clinical presentation, therapeutic management, and prognosis. The identification of high-risk NSTEMI patients is important as they may require an individualised approach that can substantially overlap with current STEMI recommendations, and their mortality remains high if their management is delayed.",Acute myocardial infraction; ECG; NSTEMI; STEMI; de winter`s pattern; wellen`s syndrome..,Andreas Mitsis;Felice Gragnano
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2198094/,Myocardial infarction in women,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in the United States regardless of gender. Women infrequently present with myocardial infarction as the initial presentation of coronary heart disease and have unrecognized infarctions more frequently than men. Myocardial infarction in women has a similar clinical presentation as in men, with the exception of an increased incidence of non-Q wave myocardial infarctions. Complications of acute infarction in women are probably similar although the majority of data has been drawn from studies involving predominantly men. Women do however experience more strokes and have less postinfarction pericarditis than their male counterparts. Left ventricular function remains the key prognostic determinant in both sexes. Recurrent infarction is increased in women with resultant elevated mortality rates. However, complex ventricular ectopy following myocardial infarction is not predictive of cardiovascular mortality in women. Early and late survival is decreased in women, an effect probably related to the increase in mean age of women as compared with men. Overall, gender distinctions are not usually made in the majority of studies involving myocardial infarction. As epidemiologic, pathophysiologic and clinical factors may be different regarding heart disease in women, further research in this important area is warranted.",,R C Hendel

Women will more often have angina preceding their first myocardial infarct, but have more unrecognized infarctions than men. Women will be older, have more concomitant disease and present later in the course of their acute myocardial infarction. Although myocardial infarction may have similar clinical presentations in men and women, there are some important differences such as an increased incidence of non Q-wave myocardial infarctions in women, and the higher rate of complication and immortality from a myocardial infarct. Women develop less collateral cardiac vessels, which may explain the increased rate of hemodynamic complications after a myocardial infarct. Both early and late survival rates are also affected by the advanced mean age of women when they do present with a myocardial infarct. There is less data regarding treatment modalities based upon gender differences but in general, it appears that women benefit from established treatment modalities in the acute setting and subsequent to the event. It has been determined that there are epidemiologic differences, but pathophysiologic and clinical factors specific to women in this setting have yet to be determined.",,M A Mendelson;R C Hendel
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26101067/,Galectin-3 and post-myocardial infarction cardiac remodeling,"This review summarizes the current literature regarding the involvement and the putative role(s) of galectin-3 in post-myocardial infarction cardiac remodeling. Post-myocardial infarction remodeling is characterized by acute loss of myocardium, which leads to structural and biomechanical changes in order to preserve cardiac function. A hallmark herein is fibrosis formation, both in the early and late phase following acute myocardial infarction. Galectin-3, a β-galactoside-binding lectin, which is a shared factor in fibrosis formation in multiple organs, has an established role in cardiac fibrosis in the setting of pressure overload, neuro-endocrine activation and hypertension, but its role in post- myocardial infarction remodeling has received less attention. However, accumulative experimental studies have shown that myocardial galectin-3 expression is upregulated after myocardial infarction, both on mRNA and protein level. This already occurs shortly after myocardial infarction in the infarcted and border zone area, and also at a later stage in the spared myocardium, contributing to tissue repair and fibrosis. This is associated with typical aspects of fibrosis formation, such as apposition of matricellular proteins and increased factors of collagen turnover. Interestingly, myocardial fibrosis in experimental post-myocardial infarction cardiac remodeling could be attenuated by galectin-3 inhibition. In clinical studies, circulating galectin-3 levels have been shown to identify patients at risk for new-onset heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Circulating galectin-3 levels also predict progressive left ventricular dilatation after myocardial infarction. From literature we conclude that galectin-3 is an active player in cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction. Future studies should focus on the dynamics of galectin-3 activation after myocardial infarction, and study the possibilities to target galectin-3.",Biomarker; Fibrosis; Galectin-3; Heart failure; Myocardial infarction; Remodeling.,Wouter C Meijers;A Rogier van der Velde;Domingo A Pascual-Figal;Rudolf A de Boer

In December, 2013 a new modification of certain health and health insurance related acts such as Act XLVII/1997 regulated the operation of National Myocardial Infraction Registry. At present 65 institutions provide data regularly. The number of patients with myocardial infarction in the database was 24308 in January 1, 2014. The authors summarize the data which accumulated during almost four years of functioning of the National Myocardial Infarction Registry Program. The incidence of myocardial infarction was defined by reviewing the number of pre hospital and hospital cases in five districts of the capital and Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg County of Hungary. Reviewing the records patients with ST-elevation and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction revealed that treatment of 91% of ST-elevation patients occurred in hospitals with cardiac catheterization laboratory, and 82% of patients had primary percutaneous coronary intervention. In-hospital, 30-day and 1-year mortality were defined for patients treated for both types of myocardial infarction.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19775916/,Myocardial infarction: a paradigm of success in modern medicine,"Hospital mortality for acute myocardial infarction declined from 30% to 10% in the last 30 years, thanks to coronary care units and early revascularization with thrombolysis, angioplasty, and stent implantation. Pathologists played a major role by establishing plaque rupture and coronary thrombosis as the major cause of acute myocardial infarction and by discovering that ischemic myocardium necrosis progresses from endocardium to epicardium as a ""wave front"" phenomenon, with potential reversible injury if the reperfusion is accomplished within 3 h. Long-term mortality following myocardial infarction is mostly due to sudden electrical death, which may be prevented by pharmacologic (antiarrhythmic drugs) and nonpharmacologic (implantable cardioverter defibrillator, pacemaker) therapy. Ventricular assist devices may support the left ventricle as a bridge to transplantation. Long-term mortality at distance from acute myocardial infarction declined from 10% to 2% per year. Despite these indisputable achievements, there are still pending questions: in vivo identification of vulnerable plaque, mechanisms of thrombosis by plaque erosion, prompt treatment on the spot of instantaneous cardiac arrest by external defibrillation, adverse effect of myocardial reperfusion, fate of bare- and drug-eluting coronary stents.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17235264/,"Postoperative myocardial infarction: pathophysiology, new diagnostic criteria, prevention","With the introduction of biomarkers like troponin I (cTnI), our ability to identify and quantify myocardial infarction in the postoperative period has been greatly enhanced. Even small elevations of cTnI should be considered as a myocardial infarction. Small increases in cTnI postoperatively have indeed been found to be associated with worse short and long-term outcomes, the higher the cTnI level the worse the outcome. Studies undertaken in the 1980s when postoperative myocardial infarction (PMI) was detected by means of electrocardiogram recordings every 12 hours following operation suggested that this complication occurred on the second or third postoperative day. More recent studies where postoperative myocardial necrosis has been detected by repeated troponin dosages have revealed that, in fact, postoperative myocardial infarction appears much earlier between 12 and 32 hour after the end of surgery. Two types of PMI were identified based on intense troponin surveillance. They stem from two different major pathophysiological mechanisms. One seems to be related to plaque-vulnerability, while the other may be due to the effects of prolonged ischemia. The postoperative period should be regarded as a vulnerable period' that acts synergistically with both plaque and patient vulnerabilities in the development of PMI. Monitoring troponin levels in the postoperative period following surgery enables the identification of patients with myocardial damage and the institution of early aggressive intervention (e.g., intensive beta blockers therapy, adequate analgesia, correction of anemia) in order to prevent the evolution of PMI during this golden period' that lasts about two days. In patients that are prone to develop PMI, and especially in those who are prone to develop PMI related to plaque rupture, prevention can be achieved by better preoperative identification of the vulnerable plaque, and by a better plaque stabilization, either metabolically (e.g., statins) or by actual coronary stenting. Further understanding of the mechanisms underlying PMI, as well as their early identification, may contribute to the reduction of the incidence of PMI and its associated morality in the future.",,S Longhitano;P Coriat;F Agrò

Myocardial necrosis is usually confirmed and quantified by myocardial enzyme release in plasma. However, over 10% of patients treated with reperfusion therapy fail to develop an enzyme rise, but do exhibit transient ECG changes, which are consistent with an aborted myocardial infarction. The earlier the reperfusion therapy is instituted, the higher the incidence of aborted infarction. Treatment within an hour after symptom onset may result in 25% of aborted infarction and is in combination with complete (70%) ST-segment resolution associated with better survival. This endpoint is easy to define and occurs promptly in time. The faster that effective treatment is initiated, the more likely aborted infarction will occur.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3538802/,Assessment for prognosis during and after myocardial infarction. A plea for a stratified approach,"Right after the first signs and symptoms of acute myocardial infarctions the prognosis is determined by the interventions which are carried out at that time. Preservation of as much myocardial tissue is the key element. Early deobstruction and reperfusion of the myocardium at jeopardy can lead to limitation of the ultimate infarct size, improved ventricular function and a halving of the 1-year mortality. Early supportive therapy with beta-blockade and calcium antagonists may enhance this effect. Data in 533 patients randomized to either a reperfusion strategy or to conventional therapy, combined with those from the recent literature on thrombolysis and early beta-blockade, provide the basis for this point of view. Once infarction is unavoidable and in the process of completion, probably 3-4 h after onset of symptoms, only supportive therapy is recommended, which will hardly change the outcome except for interventions during clinical care such as defibrillation. In 351 other survivors of myocardial infarction the value of clinical variables, a symptom-limited bicycle stress test at discharge, radionuclide ventriculography and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram was compared in predicting 1-year survival. A history of previous myocardial infarction and heart failure during the current episode proved to be the strongest clinical predictors of death. Similarly, a low ejection fraction (less than 40%) and an insufficient blood pressure rise during stress testing (less than 30 mm Hg) identified a high risk group. Stress-test-induced angina and ST depression as well as ventricular arrhythmias from 24-hour electrocardiography were less good as predictors. In these patients treatment should be individualized and may require arteriography. Patients eligible for and completing a normal bicycle stress test after myocardial infarction proved to be a low risk group, which may constitute 65% of the total, seen in tertiary referral centers and even more in community hospitals. They neither require therapy nor further investigation. A subgroup with an intermediate risk can be identified when clinical variables, stress testing and/or resting radionuclide ventriculography are abnormal. This group requires 'tailored' therapy. Therefore, after infarction recovery, we recommend a pre-discharge stress test routinely to complement the clinical evaluation, since it also provides information on physical capacity, the indication of arrhythmias and the presence of myocardial ischemia. Thus, optimal management of acute myocardial infarction requires a stratified approach, which does not require expensive testing procedures.",,P G Hugenholtz;P Fioretti;M L Simoons;P W Serruys;J R Roelandt

While one approach has been to develop therapies to reduce lethal myocardial cell reperfusion injury, this concept has not translated to the clinics, and several recent negative clinical trials raise the question of whether reperfusion injury is important in humans undergoing reperfusion for acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. Therapy aimed at reducing myocardial cell death while the myocytes are still ischemic is more likely to further reduce myocardial infarct size. Developing new therapies to further reduce left ventricular remodeling after the acute event is another approach to preserving structure and function of the heart after infarction. Such therapy may include chronic administration of pharmacologic agents and/or therapies developed from the field of regenerative cardiology, including cellular or non-cellular materials such as extracellular matrix. The optimal therapy will be to administer agents that both reduce myocardial infarct size in the acute phase of infarction as well as reduce adverse left ventricular remodeling during the chronic or healing phase of myocardial infarction.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21424345/,"Pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of infarction-related cardiogenic shock","Cardiogenic shock is characterized by inadequate tissue perfusion due to cardiac dysfunction, and it is often caused by acute myocardial infarction. The mortality rate in patients with cardiogenic shock is still very high (i.e., 50-60%). The pathophysiology of cardiogenic shock involves a vicious spiral circle: ischemia causes myocardial dysfunction, which in turn aggravates myocardial ischemia. Myocardial stunning and/or hibernating myocardium can enhance myocardial dysfunction, thus, worsening the cardiogenic shock. Low perfusion pressures with global ischemia leads to multiorgan dysfunction. Ischemia and reperfusion can result in systemic inflammation or within the first few days sepsis due to the translocation of bacteria or bacterial toxins from the intestines, which can result in increased mortality. The key to an optimal treatment of cardiogenic shock patients is a structured approach: (1) rapid diagnosis and prompt initiation of therapy to increase blood pressure and augment cardiac output with subsequently improved perfusion. (2) Rapid coronary revascularization is of critical importance. Using this approach, mortality can be reduced. In many hospitals, initial stabilization is achieved by intraaortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP). However, evidence for improved survival from randomized studies on the use of IABP in combination with PCI is lacking.

This stratification has important clinical and prognostic utility. Coronary angiography during acute non-Q-wave compared with Q-wave infarction shows much higher infarct-related artery patency rates (about 75 vs. 10%) and increased coronary collateralization. Culprit legion morphology in non-Q-wave infarction commonly is complex. The frequent demonstration of recurrent clinical ischemia, or residual thallium-201 uptake abnormalities, and metabolic activity on persistent emission tomography suggest the presence of viable myocardium in the distribution of the non-Q-wave infarction usually represents 20-25% of acute myocardial infarctions. The University of California San Diego Collaborative Postinfarction Database and other large studies have found non-Q-wave infarctions to be more common in patients with a history of previous infarction and congestive heart failure, although their mortality during acute hospitalization is lower. However, in long-term followup to one year and beyond, non-Q-wave infarct mortality rates equal those of Q-wave infarction.

NSTEMI patients are increasing in numbers worldwide, among which an approximately 30% are associated with a total occlusion of a coronary artery. This review summarizes recent evidence in epidemiology, clinical, laboratory, ECG and prognostic characteristics of this NSTEMI sub-group. Patients with a diagnosis of NSTEMI and a total occluded coronary artery (TOCA) represent a sub-group of NSTEMI patients with total occlusion of coronary arteries and associated high-risk that are frequently not managed according to a STEMI-like pathway. The present review echoes a call for action in changing our everyday clinical practice. Therefore, we propose a new triage algorithm by which recognition of high-risk features in NSTEMI patients is central in order to identify STEMI 'equivalents' among NSTEMI patients in terms of similar pathology and high-risk who may benefit from immediate invasive strategy (<2 h).",Immediate invasive strategy; Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction; ST elevation myocardial infarction equivalent; Total occlusion.,Dimitrios Tziakas;George Chalikias;Rasha Al-Lamee;Juan Carlos Kaski

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1104166/,Applications of echocardiography in acute myocardial infarction,"Echocardiography has many attributes that are desirable for diagnostic and research studies in acute myocardial infarction patients. It does not alter the physiologic state being evaluated, is relatively inexpensive, and does not interfere with other hospital procedures. For these reasons, the test may be repeated frequently and used to monitor the changes after acute infarction. Useful information about left ventricular volume, diastolic pressure, and segmental wall motion may be obtained. Because echocarciographic estimates of stroke volume, ejection fraction, and velocity of circumferential fiber shortening are based on motion seen in only one ""ice-pick"" view of the heart, it is likely that they will be less reliable in patients with asynergy of contraction. Although a definite diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction cannot be made by echocardiography, abnormalities of wall motion may occur very early and support a clinical impression of infarction. An echocardiogram may also reveal changes suggesting ischemia or infarction (abnormal motion) in patients who have atypical chest pain and no other objective evidence of coronary artery disease.",,B C Corya

In parallel, the management of these patients developed steadily throughout this time and into the early years of the 21st century. From humble beginnings involving oxygen therapy, bed rest and analgesia, the relative merits of different strategies to open 'infarct-related arteries' (IRAs) are now being debated: pharmacological reperfusion, mechanical reperfusion or a combination of both these modalities. The current understanding of the process of thrombotic occlusion of the coronary artery has led to the appreciation of the importance of not simply opening the IRA, but also maintaining its patency once opened. Considerable attention is now being afforded to the significant minority of patients who do not achieve early, complete myocardial reperfusion, despite restoration of adequate flow down the epicardial IRA. Those patients who fail to achieve myocardial reperfusion, either due to late presentation or failure of reperfusion therapy, and are left with permanent myocardial scarring can now be considered.

Review of the data indicates that the controversy is more apparent than real. The pathophysiologic factor discriminating best between non-Q-wave and Q-wave infarction is the incidence rate of total occlusion of the infarct-related artery, approximately 30% in non-Q-wave infarction and 80% in Q-wave infarction. Patients with non-Q-wave infarction have a higher incidence of pre-existing angina than patients with Q-wave infarction; they also have lower peak creatine kinase levels, higher ejection fractions and lower wall-motion abnormality scores, which suggests a smaller area of acute infarction damage. However, patients with non-Q-wave infarction have a significantly shorter time to peak creatine kinase level and more heterogeneous ventriculographic and electrocardiographic infarct patterns. The in-hospital death rate is lower in non-Q-wave than in Q-wave infarction (approximately 12% v. 19%). The long-term death rates are similar for the two groups (27% and 23%), but the incidence of subsequent coronary events is higher among patients with non-Q-wave infarction; in particular, reinfarction is an important predictor of risk of death. Most of the differences in biologic and clinical variables between the two types of acute infarction can be related to a lower incidence of total occlusion, earlier reperfusion or better collateral supply in non-Q-wave infarction.

Older infarction patients are more likely to be female and to have a history of heart failure, but they are less likely to have a family history of myocardial infarction, elevated cholesterol, or to smoke. Older patients will frequently have unrecognized or silent myocardial infarctions or, when present, symptoms will be atypical. Instead of chest pain, older patients may have shortness of breath or neurological symptoms, such as confusion. Also, older infarction patients will delay longer in seeking medical assistance after onset of symptoms, and often will not demonstrate ST elevation or Q waves on their electrocardiograms. Not infrequently, older infarction patients will demonstrate major complications such as heart failure or right ventricular infarction on hospital admission, and their presenting complaints will reflect these complications.

One of the postulated mechanisms through which these determinants have been linked to health and illness is their relationship to social support. The health determinant, social isolation or lack of a social support network (SSN), and its effects on premature mortality after acute myocardial infarction mandate further scrutiny by the cardiovascular community for several reasons. First, as a predictor of 1-year mortality, low SSN is equivalent to many of the classic risk factors, such as elevated cholesterol level, tobacco use, and hypertension. Second, treatment of acute myocardial infarction is costly. Because low social support is associated with an increased 1-year mortality, neglecting the role of the SSN may diminish the possible gains accrued during acute-phase treatment. Therefore, lack of an SSN should be considered a risk factor for subsequent morbidity and mortality after a myocardial infarction. Finally, cardiac rehabilitation programs and other extant prevention strategies can be better used to reduce mortality after myocardial infarction.

Pathophysiology, clinical relevance, and importance for regenerative therapy after myocardial infarction]","The coronary microcirculation does not only control perfusion of the myocardium, but also plays an important role for the manifestation of ischemic heart disease throughout all stages of the disease. Risk factors for coronary artery disease are associated with a reduced endothelium-dependent blood flow regulation, which not only may aggravate myocardial ischemia but also determines blood flow-induced shear stress exposed to the vascular wall, modulating the vascular milieu (e. g., by controlling nitric oxide bioactivity) and thereby altering progression of atherosclerosis in conductance vessels. Furthermore, generally impaired microvascular function is predictive of cardiovascular events, e. g., after percutaneous coronary interventions or after an acute myocardial infarction. In the latter case, thrombotic embolism from ruptured plaques in the conductance vessels as well as inflammation and reperfusion injury are the essential components of the microvascular disorder. Interestingly, therapeutic strategies which improve microvascular dysfunction, such as statins in stable coronary artery disease or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors during acute myocardial infarction, are associated with an improved long-term prognosis. These facts give promise for new therapeutic principles: experimental data demonstrate, that the therapeutic application of stem or progenitor cells after an acute myocardial infarction induces growth of new microvessels (neovascularization) and thereby improves microvascular perfusion, which may favorably alter infarct expansion and remodeling. First clinical data, demonstrating indeed an improved coronary blood flow regulation after progenitor cell therapy in patients with ischemic heart disease, have to be established by further clinical trials.",,Volker Schächinger;Andreas M Zeiher

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6338085/,Hypertension and myocardial infarction,"Because hypertension and myocardial infarction are closely linked in several ways, a better understanding of this relation leads to more effective prophylaxis and management. Management should be directed at three different areas: 1) the prevention of a first myocardial infarction, 2) the prevention of complications after an infarction, and 3) the management of hypertension during evolution of an acute infarction. There is good evidence that beta-receptor blocking agents are beneficial to long-term management. When therapy is required in the acute situation, arteriolar vasodilators are to be avoided and combined arteriolar/venular dilators are the drugs of choice.",,F G Dunn
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8653254/,Advances in the early diagnosis and management of acute myocardial infarction,The effective early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction still rests primarily on the clinical history and the electrocardiogram. ST segment elevation is specific though sometimes short lived and less than ideally sensitive; but with bundle branch block it defines a population that benefits importantly from thrombolysis. Novel electrode configurations can further enhance diagnosis but have not become popular. Biochemical markers are rarely of help in the first four hours and cardiac scanning is impractical for routine care. Computerised diagnostic systems show promise in prototype but are not widely available. Early management involves reestablishing coronary flow by thrombolytic and antithrombotic agents and reducing myocardial oxygen requirement by analgesics and beta blockers. Nitrates and magnesium have limited roles. Immediate access to defibrillation and advanced life support is mandatory. Diagnosis and management can only begin after help has been sought. Public alertness to the symptoms of myocardial infarction and a coordinated response by health care personnel are fundamental to successful care.,,R Vincent
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1836091/,Ventricular enlargement and remodeling following acute myocardial infarction: mechanisms and management,"Severe myocardial ischemia, when sustained, leads to a predictable sequence of events, including myocardial necrosis, expansion of the infarct, and later its replacement by scar tissue. The nonischemic tissue sustains ventricular function, but it frequently adapts to the extra load placed on it by dilating. The enlargement and remodeling of the left ventricle may lead to ventricular failure and arrhythmias. Rational management to prevent these complications includes restoration of the patency of the occluded vessel and ventricular unloading. These two interventions may be useful both early and late in the course of infarction.",,E Braunwald;M A Pfeffer

Two thirds had a history of hypertension known before infarction. The systolic and diastolic blood pressures measured at 3 months and 1 yr after infarction increased with age. There was no difference between patients with and without hypertension with respect to a number of different variables recorded during the hospital period, nor in multiple risk according to a logistic function. There was no difference in death rate between the two groups. However, the rate of non-fatal reinfarction was significantly higher among the hypertensive patients.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7919591/,Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction,"A number of new techniques have been shown to be superior to creatine kinase and the 12-lead ECG for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. Myoglobin and heart fatty acid-binding protein are more sensitive than creatine kinase for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction; myoglobin is also a superior marker for estimating infarct size. Cardiac troponin is a protein specific for the myocardium. It can be used to differentiate myocardial necrosis when creatine kinase levels are elevated from other clinical conditions. Body surface potential mapping and vectorcardiography are better for localizing the site of acute myocardial infarction than the standard 12-lead ECG. Although echocardiography is frequently used for evaluating infarct remodeling, in the future it could be replaced by ultrafast computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Two excellent techniques for the determination of myocardial viability are late thallium redistribution imaging and positron-emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose.",,C Murray;J S Alpert

In the Clinic of Cardiosurgery of Kaunas University of Medicine (since January 2001 till July 2003) 82 patients with acute myocardial infarction underwent surgery. Patients were operated on the 1(st)-21(st) day after myocardial infarction. Among 82 operated patients with acute myocardial infarction, 64 (78%) underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and 18 (22%) - coronary artery bypass grafting with mitral valve repair. Ten patients (55.6%) were in NYHA functional class II and 44.4% - in NYHA functional class III. Before myocardial infarction ischemic heart disease was diagnosed in 12 (66.7%) patients; 8 (44.4%) patients had a history of myocardial infarction. Patients were not operated during the first 24 hours of myocardial infarction.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1725051/,Pathophysiologic factors influencing prognosis after myocardial infarction,"The major determinants of outcome after surviving the acute phase of myocardial infarction include the extent of cumulative myocardial damage, infarct type and location, ventricular electrical instability, the extent of residual jeopardized ischemic myocardium, rheologic conditions, and neurohumoral factors. These several factors are intimately related to each other, yet each contributes prognostic information. Patients with multiple myocardial infarctions are at considerably greater mortality risk than those with first infarctions. Patients with first infarctions are approximately 2 years younger, have less advanced coronary disease, have less left ventricular dysfunction, and have a better outcome than those with one or more prior infarctions. Recently, the importance of nonfatal reinfarction as a time-dependent predictor of subsequent cardiac death has been appreciated. The relative contribution of nonfatal reinfarction to the risk of cardiac death is highest in patients with a first myocardial infarction. These findings indicate that prevention of further myocardial damage (reinfarction), optimization of left ventricular function, and reduction in myocardial ischemia should improve prognosis after myocardial infarction.",,A J Moss

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7919592/,Thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction,"Thrombolytic therapy has revolutionized the treatment of acute myocardial infarction by reducing mortality and preserving left ventricular function. It is relatively safe and cost-effective. However, it is currently underused in most countries. Patients in whom thrombolysis is indicated include those with ST elevation on the electrocardiogram or bundle branch block pattern who present within 12 hours of myocardial infarction; the indications should be widened to include the elderly, patients who have undergone nontraumatic cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and women during menstruation. The risk-benefit ratio should be assessed for the individual patient. Prehospital thrombolytic treatment has been shown to be feasible with the support of well-trained staff and resuscitation equipment, and may be cost-effective in communities with time delays before hospitalization greater than 1 hour. The most important strategy is to shorten the ""door to needle"" time in hospital. The importance of full infarct-related artery flow (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] grade 3 flow) for preservation of ventricular function and survival has been documented in the second Thrombolysis Trial of Eminase in Acute Myocardial Infarction (TEAM 2) and the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) studies. Aspirin and heparin are beneficial adjunctive regimens to thrombolytic therapy but optimal epicardial reperfusion is achieved in only about half of patients.

We defined self-reported myocardial infarction with electro-cardiographic evidence as ""typical myocardial infarction."" We defined self-reported myocardial infarction without electrocardiographic evidence, but verified with additional clinical information, as ""non-Q-wave myocardial infarction."" Finally, we defined myocardial infarction detected by electrocardiogram that was not self-reported as ""silent myocardial infarction,"" after verification of absence of symptoms. Overall, the prevalence of typical myocardial infarction was 4.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.5-4.9], of non-Q-wave myocardial infarction 2.8% (95% CI = 2.2-3.4), and of silent myocardial infarction 3.9% (95% CI = 3.2-4.5). Silent myocardial infarction was more prevalent in women, hypertensives, cigarette smokers, and those with higher post-load blood glucose. Self-reported myocardial infarction without electrocardiographic characteristics could be verified as myocardial infarction by means of additional clinical information in 56% of the cases. We conclude that myocardial infarction occurs frequently in the elderly without typical symptoms or electrocardiographic changes.

The new definition has multiple medical, epidemiological, social, occupational and other implications. As many as 30% of patients previously diagnosed with unstable angina now receive the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. These additional patients change the epidemiology of acute myocardial infarction. New approaches to issues of insurance and employment following myocardial infarction are necessary following the introduction of the new definition. A few aspects of the new definition of myocardial infarction remain controversial, especially those regarding mild myocardial damage following percutaneous coronary intervention.

The easiest measurable index of autonomic activity is heart rate variability, which can be assessed in a number of different ways. Where heart rate variability is low after myocardial infarction, long-term survival is considerably reduced, independent of other known risk factors.

Methods: The rats were divided into control group (n=23) and model group (n=107), the rat hearts were scanned by the laser doppler perfusion imager before and after operation respectively, and the data was analyzed to acquire the rate of surface blood flow change of the heart. Myocardial infarction size of model group was detected by NBT. Model group were divided into three subgroups of mild myocardial infarction, moderate myocardial infarction and severe myocardial infarction according to the myocardial infarction size, and an analysis was made on the correlativity between rate of surface blood flow change of the heart and myocardial infarction size. Results: Myocardial infarction size was highly correlated to the rate of surface blood flow change of the heart in model group (r=0.849 6, P<0.000 1). There was no significant correlation between infarction size and heart blood flow in the mild myocardial infarction subgroup (r=-0.133 6, P>0.05), while the correlation in moderate myocardial infarction was significant (r=0.721 7, P<0.000 1), and the highest correlation was shown in severe myocardial infarction subgroup (r=0.910 2, P<0.000 1). Conclusion: The heart surface blood flow has a close relationship with the myocardial infarction size in rat, so the change of heart blood perfusion can beused as an effective reference to establish and identify rat myocardial infarction model.",,Q Lei;C Chen;X L Wu;W J Chen;T Yi;M D Ma;Y He;X R Shui;S A Huang;C Chen;W Lei

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8665367/,Triggering of acute myocardial infarction,"The mechanisms of acute coronary artery disease onset are receiving increasing attention. Study of these mechanisms has been stimulated by the finding that the onset of acute myocardial infarction is more likely during the morning hours after awakening, suggesting that activities of the patient often trigger the event. Triggering may occur when stressors placed on the body produce hemodynamic, vasoconstrictive, and prothrombotic forces-acute risk factors-that can cause disruption of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque leading to thrombosis. Insight into triggering and plaque vulnerability may lead to a new approach in the prevention of acute myocardial infarction.",,N I Kondo;J E Muller

A number of observational studies suggest that patients who survive a first myocardial infarction have a halved risk of dying or of recurrence as compared to those who continue to smoke. Presently it is estimated that about 80% of smokers surviving a myocardial infarction quit smoking in short time.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2867883/,Early use of beta-adrenergic-blocking agents in acute myocardial infarction,"Of recent interest is the acute use of beta-adrenergic-blocking agents in patients who have suffered an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Acute use of beta-blockers refers to initiation of therapy within hours following the onset of symptoms suggestive of AMI. The proposed goal of therapy is to alter the infarction process to improve mortality. Because of the hyperadrenergic activity present in patients during an infarction, beta-blockers are theoretically an attractive therapeutic intervention because of their sympatholytic properties. Acute use of beta-blockers has been shown to limit infarct size, as determined by cardiac enzyme activity, and reduce the incidence of major ventricular arrhythmias. Beta-blockers may also prevent infarction in patients with symptoms suggestive of infarction. However, the acute use of beta-adrenergic-blocking agents has not been shown to reduce short-term (less than or equal to 30 d) mortality. In view of this fact, the acute use of beta-adrenergic-blocking agents cannot be recommended.",,V F Mauro;F P Zeller
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8139631/,Right ventricular infarction,"Right ventricular infarction complicates up to half of inferior left ventricular infarctions. The term represents a spectrum of disease from mild, asymptomatic right ventricular dysfunction to cardiogenic shock, and it includes transient ischemic myocardial dysfunction as well as myocardial necrosis. Right ventricular infarction is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, and its presence defines a high-risk subgroup of patients with inferior left ventricular infarction. Diagnosis of this condition requires a high degree of suspicion based on clinical findings and the early recording of the electrocardiogram through right precordial leads, as well as elevated right-sided filling pressures out of proportion to left-sided filling pressures. The proper management of right ventricular infarction requires sustaining adequate right ventricular preload with volume loading and maintenance of atrioventricular synchrony, reduction of right ventricular afterload (particularly when left ventricular dysfunction is present), and inotropic support of the right ventricle. Early reperfusion with fibrinolytic therapy or direct angioplasty is also warranted. Survivors of right ventricular infarction generally have a restoration of normal right ventricular function with resolution of hemodynamic abnormalities.",,J W Kinch;T J Ryan

However, image quality is often degraded by ghost artifacts from blood flow, and respiratory and cardiac contractile motion. To enhance the usefulness of this technique for detailed characterization of infarction, a velocity-compensated spin-echo pulse sequence was tested by imaging a flow phantom, 6 normal subjects and 17 patients with acute myocardial infarction. After preliminary studies were performed in 7 patients to determine optimal imaging parameters, a standardized imaging protocol was used in the next 10. The location of myocardial infarction identified by the electrocardiogram and coronary anatomy was correctly identified in 10 of 10 patients. Distribution of the injury within the left ventricle was clearly visualized, and showed that patients often had a mixture of transmural and nontransmural injury. Heterogenous distribution of signal intensity within the infarction suggested the presence of hemorrhage. Papillary muscle involvement was readily apparent. Signal intensity of the infarction (brightest segment) was increased by 89 +/- 31% compared with the mean of the remote segments. The myocardial/skeletal muscle ratio was significantly (p less than 0.001) increased for the infarction segments compared with that for remote myocardium, allowing quantitative analysis of segmental signal intensity. The MRI wall motion study obtained as part of this protocol demonstrated wall thickening in 58% of the infarction segments and in 6 of 10 patients. This finding suggested the presence of reversibly injured myocardium. In conclusion, the results demonstrate the potential of MRI for detailed tissue characterization after acute myocardial infarction.",,D L Johnston;R E Wendt 3rd;S L Mulvagh;H Rubin

Thallium SPECT is to be preferred in this indication even if new tracers could be promising: fatty acids, 18Fluorodesoxyglucose imaged by PET or SPECT cameras.

The right ventricular ejection fraction did not differ significantly between the groups, but left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly depressed after anterior myocardial infarction. There was evidence of right ventricular dilatation and impaired transit in the group with inferior infarction. Five patients with anterior infarction and six with inferior infarction had abnormal right ventricular ejection fractions. Right ventricular wall motion abnormalities affected the septal wall in the group with anterior infarction and the free wall in the group with inferior infarction. The relation between right and left ventricular ejection fractions was markedly different in the two groups. In the group with anterior infarction there was a significant linear relation between right and left ventricular ejection fraction, whereas in the group with inferior infarction there was not. Thus right ventricular dysfunction commonly occurs after both anterior and inferior myocardial infarction. Right and left ventricular impairment are related after anterior myocardial infarction, but are independent after inferior myocardial infarction. Finally, the different effects of anterior and inferior myocardial infarction on right ventricular function may be explained by differences in septal and free wall involvement.",,J L Caplin;D S Dymond;W D Flatman;R A Spurrell

However, a simple and early predictor for the subsequent development of myocardial infarction during the ischemic phase is of significant value for the identification of ischemic patients at high risk. The present study was undertaken by using non-human primate model of myocardial ischemic infarction to fulfill this gap. Twenty male Rhesus monkeys at age of 2-3 years old were subjected to left anterior descending artery ligation. This ligation was performed at varying position along the artery so that it produced varying sizes of myocardial infarction at the late stage. The ECG recording was undertaken before the surgical procedure, at 2 h after the ligation, and 8 weeks after the surgery for each animal. The correlation of the changes in the ECG waves in the early or the late stage with the myocardial infarction size was analyzed. The R wave depression and the QT shortening in the early ischemic stage were found to have an inverse correlation with the myocardial infarction size. At the late stage, the R wave depression, the QT prolongation, the QRS score, and the ST segment elevation were all closely correlated with the developed infarction size. The poor R wave progression was identified at both the early ischemic and the late infarction stages. Therefore, the present study using non-human primate model of myocardial ischemic infarction identified the decreases in the R wave and the QT interval as early predictors of myocardial infarction. Validation of these parameters in clinical studies would greatly help identifying patients with myocardial ischemia at high risk for the subsequent development of myocardial infarction.",,Xiaorong Sun;Jindan Cai;Xin Fan;Pengfei Han;Yuping Xie;Jianmin Chen;Ying Xiao;Y James Kang

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7503618/,[Impact of controlling risk factors after myocardial infarction],"The relative risks of each factors and the benefits of their reduction after myocardial infarction are comparable to those observed in primary prevention. However, because of an overexposure to the risk, the absolute gains are five times greater. The impact of diet is one of the most important: in addition to the limitation of polyunsaturated fats and global calory intake, especially in cases of central obesity, the increase in dietary alpha-linolenic acid and in omega-3, has been shown to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and mortality by up to 70%. Supplements of vitamins A and E could be useful. After infarction, the risks of an ex-smoker decrease rapidly by half and become comparable to those of non-smokers in 2 to 3 years. Physical exercise reduces cardiovascular mortality by 20-25% and contributes to better control of risk factors. The management of some psycho-physiological factors (reaction to stress, hostility) also gives encouraging results). A 10% reduction in total cholesterol leads to a 20% or more decrease in coronary events and a 10% reduction in mortality with a marked dose-response effect inciting to the reduction of its level to under 2 g/l. The progression of atherosclerosis delayed; early lesions, with the greatest risk of rupture and thrombosis, are stabilised and may even regress. A low HDL-c concentration should lead to more energetic reduction of LDL-c and control of smoking, obesity and sedentarity.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3967404/,Significance of the Q wave in acute myocardial infarction,"Acute myocardial infarction may be associated with the development of Q waves on the electrocardiogram (ECG), or with changes limited to the ST segment or T wave. The ECG changes do not accurately differentiate transmural from nontransmural infarction. However, the presence or absence of a Q wave does correlate with some aspects of the clinical course of patients after myocardial infarction, and is therefore of prognostic value. Q-wave infarctions are more likely to be complicated by congestive heart failure during hospitalization. The in-hospital mortality is also higher after a Q-wave infarction than after a non-Q infarction. Both of these findings are probably due to the association of a Q wave with a larger mass of infarcted myocardium. The long-term mortality, however, is the same for Q-wave and non-Q-wave infarctions. This is probably due to an increased late mortality after non-Q infarctions, related in part to a higher rate of reinfarction. The differences between Q-wave and non-Q-wave infarctions are not due to obvious differences in extent and location of coronary artery obstructions. However, there may be differences in the collateral circulation, with more extensive collaterals associated with non-Q infarcts. Appreciation of the prognostic significance of the ECG changes in acute myocardial infarction may help direct the evaluation and management of the patient after myocardial infarction.",,R K Goldberg;P E Fenster

The widespread use of intravenous thrombolytic therapy during the early hours of myocardial infarction has resulted in a decreasing incidence of shock with first myocardial infarctions. Three mechanisms bring about cardiogenic shock: (1) extensive aggregate systolic left ventricular dysfunction, (2) extensive right ventricular infarction, and (3) mechanical defects of the left and/or right ventricles attendant to ischemic dysfunction or rupture. To permit survival in cardiogenic shock, even with maximally aggressive therapy, diagnostic evaluation must be carried out concurrently with clinical stabilization of the patient. IABC is the mainstay for supporting the patient in shock during further efforts at diagnosis and definitive therapy.

(2) When a healed myocardial infarct at a specific location is recognized with electrocardiographic criteria, it is likely that there are unrecognized infarcts involving other areas of the left ventricle. (3) Infarctions involving the lateral and inferobasal areas are frequently unrecognized. (4) The electrocardiogram is more likely to miss myocardial infarcts in patients with multiple, than in those with single, electrocardiographically diagnosed infarcts. (5) Apical myocardial infarction does not appear to have specific electrocardiographic findings, other than those related to general infarct localization by electrocardiogram, particularly in patients with anteroseptal or anterolateral infarction. (6) Abnormal Q waves, generally thought to indicate transmural myocardial infarction, are frequently found in subendocardial infarction.

Furthermore, they less frequently present with typical symptoms and a typical electrocardiogram pattern. Whereas age is the most important predictor for mortality after AMI, the relationship between age and morbidity is more complex. Treatment of elderly patients with AMI is very similar to treatment of younger patients. However, the risk of intolerability to various drugs increases with age, and in many instances doses have to be adjusted. In many trials, the number of lives saved with various interventions seem, if anything, to be more numerous among the elderly. However, it should be remembered that experience with various treatments in the elderly (patients aged > 80 years) is limited. Whether experiences with people aged up to 80 years can be extrapolated to higher age groups is debatable.

The traditional electrocardiographic labels imply a level of precision that is unwarranted and so obscure real, often clinically important differences that exist among patients. We believe the electrocardiogram becomes more powerful when it is used with other noninvasive tests, and all such tests are best interpreted within rather than removed from the clinical context. We suggest as well that frequently after infarction, zones of viable muscle exist that are still vulnerable to ischemia. These zones may lie within or be remote from the actual infarct region, and noninvasive tests should be milked for clues that these regions are present, for while there is little to be done for necrotic tissue after infarction, there is considerable therapy available, both medical and surgical, to rescue tissue at risk of ischemia after infarction.",,J Ferguson;R Lisbona;D Rahal;J P Beaudry;A Sniderman

However benefits of other therapies should not be overlooked. General care measures should include: close supervision, bed rest, liquid diet, analgesics, reduction of anxiety, oxygen therapy, intravenous heparin and aspirin, monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate. beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, combined or not with thrombolytic therapy, are also available to reduce the rate of mortality and morbidity.

The medical records were analyzed of 139 patients discharged from San Francisco General Hospital after recovery from an acute myocardial infarction between July 1978 and September 1981. Multivariate stepwise discriminant analysis of 20 variables contributing to sudden and total death identified complex ventricular ectopic rhythm as the most important variable, followed by age. Failure to receive chronic long-acting nitrates was an independent variable contributing to total mortality but not to sudden death, while the presence of an initial anterior myocardial infarction and impaired left ventricular function were independent variables contributing to sudden death but not to total mortality.

All patients underwent paired baseline (before angioplasty) and predischarge quantitative tomographic perfusion imaging with technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi techniques for assessment of the initial area at risk and final infarct size. The myocardial salvage index was defined as the proportion of jeopardized myocardium that was salvaged.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11475986/,[Secondary prevention in acute myocardial infarction],"Myocardial infarction is still one of the main causes of mortality and morbidity in Western countries. The advances made in the last 30 years have made it possible to reduce mortality significantly (which is currently below two digits) as well as morbidity. The subject of secondary prevention of myocardial infarction gains particular significance in this context since 10 to 15% of the patients who survive the hospital phase of myocardial infarction die during the first year following discharge and, of these deaths, half occur in the first three months. Therefore, it is necessary to make an early definition of the risk of another coronary event, that is, to make a risk stratification. This should occur throughout hospitalization and should be complete at the time of discharge, never beyond the first weeks of evolution. Bearing in mind the age, sex, coronary risk factors, ischemia persistence, the degree of left ventricular dysfunction and the presence of malignant disrhythmias, there are three risk levels: high; intermediate; and low. An overall approach to secondary prevention of infarction should take into account that, apart from the factors of such high prognostic value (Chapter II) assessed in the definition of risk groups, the measures to reduce reinfarction and sudden death (Chapter III) and the control of the risk factors for heart disease (Chapter IV) should also be considered. The principal late complications of infarction with significant prognostic influence are described in Chapter III: left ventricular dysfunction; rhythm disturbances and residual ischemia. The diagnostic criteria and therapeutic objectives are considered in each of the groups with relevance to consolidated advances according to the modern concept of evidence based medicine, according to international regulations. The grading of scientific evidence into three distinct categories (A, B and C), based on five levels of evidence classified from I to V, is presented accordingly in relation to the therapeutic proposals. Chapter III deals with a set of therapeutic interventions used in secondary prevention because they reduce reinfarction and sudden death: platelet antiaggregants; anticoagulants; Beta blockers; calcium channel blockers; antioxidants and nitrates. A concept of particular clinical significance is presented for each of these groups of drugs. The last part contains an eminently clinical overall review of the principal advances in coronary risk factor control, new therapeutic acquisitions in atherosclerotic disease with natural relevance to hypolipidemic agents and statins, which apart from controlling the plasmatic levels of cholesterol, also stabilize the atherosclerotic plaque and reduce acute coronary events significantly. Apart from dyslipidemia, the classic risk factors are: smoking; hypertension; obesity; diabetes and sedentary life. In each case, reference is made to the general measures and specific approaches, as well as the pharmacological therapy according to evidence based medicine. The recommended attitudes are pointed out. The role of cardiac rehabilitation and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy are also discussed in the last part of these recommendations, in which the on-going controversy regarding hormone replacement therapy is pointed out in view of the results of more recent clinical trials.",,R Ferreira;D Ferreira;M J Correia;M E De Sá;J V De Sousa;J V Sousa;M G Tavares

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1725050/,Why do patients die after myocardial infarction?,"Death during and following myocardial infarction can arise from a number of different causes. Some of them, such as early ventricular fibrillation and cardiac rupture, seem unrelated to infarct size. However, deaths occurring later during the course of infarction do seem to be related to the extent of myocardial damage and to such phenomena as infarct extension and expansion, and the mechanisms involved include cardiac failure and shock, and late arrhythmias. Preventive measures must be directed at the various mechanisms involved. Thrombolytic drugs, by limiting infarct size, prevent death from several causes, whereas beta-blockers seem mainly to operate by preventing early rupture, reinfarction, and late ventricular fibrillation. Aspirin prevents reinfarction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may prove to have a beneficial role in the early phase by unloading the heart and later by preventing infarct expansion and subsequent cardiac failure.",,D G Julian

Cine MRI provides a reliable analysis of regional and global disturbances of cardiac wall motion with a high temporal and spatial resolution. Tagging techniques permit the noninvasive labelling of parts of the myocardium and the identification of three-dimensional patterns of contraction. Myocardial perfusion and disturbed wall motion under pharmacologic stress can be reliably assessed by MRI as well.

Occlusion was maintained for 60 to 240 min before reperfusion to produce nontransmural lesions of various sizes. Electrocardiographic data were registered from 84 torso electrodes by body surface mapping techniques before and 1 week after infarction. Infarct size was quantitated by computer analysis of heart slices stained with triphenyl tetrazolium chloride. Six dogs did not develop infarction. Of the remaining 24, 10 did and 14 did not develop significant changes in body surface Q wave duration and width. The incidence of Q wave changes was not different in dogs with nontransmural and those with transmural lesions. Infarct size (expressed as a percentage of the left ventricle infarcted), the percentage of endocardium subjacent to infarction, the average depth of necrosis, the percent of the four outer fifths of the ventricular wall infarcted, and the duration of occlusion were significantly (p less than .05) greater in dogs with than in those without Q wave changes. Logistic regression modeling demonstrated that only two anatomic parameters--percentage of left ventricle infarcted and average lesion depth--significantly and independently predicted Q wave development. A model including only these two variables accurately classified all 24 cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,D M Mirvis;L Ingram;M K Holly;J L Wilson;K B Ramanathan

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2743624/,Delay time in suspected acute myocardial infarction and the importance of its modification,This paper summarizes the present knowledge of delay time in suspected acute myocardial infarction. More than 50% of deaths in acute myocardial infarction occur outside of the hospital setting. Recent experiences indicate that early and even late mortality can be dramatically reduced by intervention in the early phase. This points up the importance of bringing patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction to the hospital as early in the course of MI as possible. The predominating cause of delay is the time it takes for the patient to decide to go to hospital regardless of a previous history of cardiovascular disease. Patients arriving in hospital in later stages of MI are at a very high risk of mortality. Therefore one of the most important problems to be resolved is how to reduce delay time in suspected acute myocardial infarction. Such efforts have been surprisingly few. Limited experiences indicate that public education can reduce delay time dramatically.,,J Herlitz;M Blohm;M Hartford;A Hjalmarsson;S Holmberg;B W Karlson

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18225436/,"[Myocardial infarction with ""angiographycally normal coronary arteries"" myth or reality?]","The leading cause of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with coronary heart disease is plaque rupture. Between 6% and 12% of AMI patients have angiographically normal coronary arteries. However, new procedures have demonstrated the limits of coronarography and challenged the existence of this situation. Angiograms may fail to detect minimal lesions whereas, in many cases, intravascular sonography reveals small atherosclerotic plaques. With the development of intravascular sonography and multislice computed tomography, the prevalence of myocardial infarction with normal coronary arteries has fallen to about 1%. Myocardial infarction with normal coronary arteries may be due to coronary vasospasm, hypercoagulable states, intense sympathetic stimulation, non atherosclerotic coronary disease, alcohol or cocaine abuse, and systemic diseases. In a series of 1205 AMI patients, we found no significant coronary disease in 45 patients, but intravascular sonography showed minimal intracoronary plaque in 21 of these cases. The 24 patients without significant lesions were young, had no risk factors for AMI without a prodrome, low peak creatine release, a small reduction in the left ventricular ejection fraction after thrombolysis or angioplasty, and good outcome at 26 months. The mechanisms of AMI in these 24 patients were coronary spasm, myocardial bridge, a prothrombotic state, contraceptive pill usage, and drug or alcohol abuse. The diferential diagnoses of these cases of AMI are acute myocarditis and stress cardiomyopathy, and apical left ventricular ballooning. Initial management is the same as for ""conventional"" AMI, including pain relief nitrates, antiplatelet agents, heparin, thrombolysis or angioplasty in the acute phase, and ACE inhibitors. Patients with spasm should receive calcium antagonists rather than beta-blockers. The prognosis of these patients is better than that of patients with atherosclerotic lesions. They nonetheless need close follow-up and strict secondary prevention measures, including smoking cessation and prevention of dyslipidemia and diabetes.",,Jean-Paul Bounhoure;Horma Ouldzen;Didier Carrié;Marie-Jeanne Alibelli;Jacques Puel

Beliefs about myocardial infarction may influence coping with the illness, expectations for recovery, patients' reactions to subsequent cardiac events, morbidity and compliance rates and attendance at rehabilitation courses. This qualitative study explores patients' interpretation of the symptoms of myocardial infarction and their personal theories about the illness. Data collection was undertaken in a coronary care unit, using semi-structured interviews with 50 patients. Ethnographic content analysis was used to develop an insightful description of commonalties in the data. Major categories from the data included: providing a historical context, the metaphor of a heart attack, labelling of symptoms and making sense of the illness experience. Interventions to increase participation in rehabilitation programmes need to take into consideration patients' theories about their illness.",,Lee-Anne Gassner;Sandra Dunn;Neil Piller

Two important indexes of ischemia-induced damage (infarction size and arrhythmias) were determined by computerized planimetry and ECG analysis, respectively. Honey (1% and 2%) reduced infarct size from 23±3.1% (control) to 9.7±2.4 and 9.5±2.3%, respectively (P<0.001). At the ischemia, honey (1%) significantly reduced (P<0.05) the number and duration of ventricular tachycardia (VT). Honey (1% and 2%) also significantly decreased number of ventricular ectopic beats (VEBs). In addition, incidence and duration of reversible ventricular fibrillation (Rev VF) were lowered by honey 2% (P<0.05). During reperfusion, honey produced significant reduction in the incidences of VT, total and Rev VF, duration and number of VT. The results showed cardioprotective effects of prolonged pre-treatment of rats with honey following myocardial infarction.

If persons with AMI are to benefit from emergency thrombolytic therapy, angioplasty, and other interventions, they may require emergency transfer within hours to one of the 10% of hospitals that provide these services. We report our experience with the emergency aeromedical treatment and transfer for acute intervention of 104 consecutive patients with suspected AMI. Between May 1983 and December 1984, 104 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction were transported by an aeromedical team, including a physician and nurse, for emergency cardiac evaluation. AMI was confirmed in 94 (90%), and emergency intervention was carried out in 75 of 104 (72%). Ninety patients (87%) survived to be discharged from the hospital. There were no deaths during transport. Complications requiring treatment occurred in 13 (12%) of the patients during transport; physician skill or judgment was exercised in 27 of 104 transports (26%) and did not correlate with the Killip classification of physical findings.

The hospital mortality was 0.6%. Of the 56 (7.8%) patients who sustained perioperative myocardial infarction, two died. Left ventricular angiography supported the diagnosis in 40 patients and aided in quantification of myocardial infarction. Age, preoperative symptomatic status, incidence of prior myocardial infarction, and perfusion and axoxia timed did not correlate with myocardial infarction, but extent of coronary disease, number of grafts, and associated endarterectomy did. There have been no late deaths in the 54 survivors of perioperative infarction, which appears usually to be a benign event. Graft occlusion was nearly three times commoner in patients with myocardial infarction, and in 42 of 54 survivors the myocardial infarction could be explained by new impairment of perfusion, usually owing to compromise of the grafted artery. The relationship of perioperative infarction to iatrogenic diminution of perfusion, of the infarcted segment suggests that technical factors, especially meticulous attention to the quality of the graft-coronary artery anastomosis might further reduce the perioperative infarction rate.",,J R Burton;G M FitzGibbon;W J Keon;A J Leach

Unfortunately, most patients reach medical facilities more than 2 h into their infarction, and further time is lost in hospital before initiation of thrombolytic therapy. Thus, in the majority of patients with acute myocardial infarction the most critical period for effective therapy is missed. The delay between onset of cardiac symptoms suggestive of myocardial infarction and initiation of therapy has three components: (1) onset of symptoms, call for medical help; (2) travelling; (3) medical decision and start of treatment. Numerous studies show that it would be difficult to reduce the total time for onset of symptoms to call for medical help without an intensive media campaign. Recent observations documented the extraordinary delay in patient presentation and treatment in hospital. Thus, if the acute event could be diagnosed in the field and the team trained to initiate treatment immediately at home, time spent in travelling and in hospital will be significantly reduced.

By analyzing the time course of myocardial injury during ischemia, the reversibility of lesions with reperfusion, and the characteristics of reversibly injured tissues along the border zone of ischemic areas, concepts have been formulated regarding the possibility of salvaging marginally injured cells. Measures designed to diminish myocardial oxygen consumption, to increase blood flow or oxygen supply to ischemic areas, to increase substrate availability, or to change the degree of swelling and autolysis of injured cells have all been tested in experimental animals with some success. These methods are just beginning to be tested in the clinical setting, and, if successful, will no doubt usher in a new era in medical therapy for acute myocardial infarction.",,W B Hood Jr

The author presents the case of 16 years old boy diagnosed with MI and treated in Cardiology Department in Sanok, Poland. The author paid attention to excessive physical activity in a patient with elevated blood pressure and positive family history.

This article discusses the data concerning the prognostic significance of the grades of ischemia on the presenting electrocardiogram and the possible underlying mechanism of terminal QRS distortion. Patients with grade III ischemia have more severe ischemia and faster progression of necrosis than patients with grade II ischemia.

Perhaps the most important, although as yet unanswered, question is when is it too late to reopen an artery? Further, is reperfusion by interventional techniques preferable to reperfusion by lytic therapy alone? Although a reduction in mortality has not been demonstrated for thrombolysis beyond 12 hours (other than the Second International Study of Infarct Survival, ISIS-2), improvements in ventricular function (which might translate into a survival benefit) have been demonstrated even for very delayed reperfusion. It is hoped that future work will allow us to answer better when such therapy might be preferable.",,J A Ambrose
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4026167/,[Transmural myocardial infarction. An impossible electrocardiographic diagnosis],"The anatomical and experimental data clearly show that transmural myocardial infarction does not always produce a pathological Q wave on the ECG, but may sometimes only cause abnormalities of the ST segment and the T wave. Conversely, a sub-endocardial myocardial infarction may present with pathological Q waves. Schematically, the histology of transmural myocardial infarction usually reveals so-called coagulation necrosis, while sub-endocardial myocardial infarction generally corresponds to myofibrillary degeneration (contraction band necrosis), which promotes a reperfusion process. Very often, however, the histological appearance is not so clear-cut and the features tend to overlap. Consequently, in practice, it does not seem justified to use the electrocardiogram as a basis to distinguish between transmural and sub-endocardial infarctions, in terms of prognosis, or to select possible candidates for coronary angiography following a first myocardial infarction.",,P Hallali;R Haiat

Various emotions and personality characteristics can be both risk factors for and consequences of acute MI. Components of the Type A behavior pattern and levels of somatic and emotional awareness have been linked with excessive treatment-seeking delay for MI patients. Psychiatric conditions such as panic disorder may mimic symptomatic presentation of MI and therefore have implications for differential diagnosis in the emergency room. Additionally, anxiety, depression, and neurobehavioral disorders such as delirium are relatively common during the hospitalization period and may contribute to potentially lethal complications of MI. Because psychological factors are associated with prognosis during each phase of MI, the identification and treatment of such factors are crucial in providing comprehensive care for MI patients.",,L W Kenyon;M W Ketterer;R C Preisman

Sixteen of these patients had been psychiatrically ill before the infarction and their psychiatric symptoms and social difficulties persisted throughout the 12 month period of observation. In contrast, patients whose psychiatric morbidity had been precipitated by the infarction tended to have transient symptoms and fewer problems of social adjustment. Measures of psychiatric morbidity one week after the attack did not predict subsequent mortality or difficulty in returning to work.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7634265/,[Myocardial viability in acute myocardial infarction and verapamil],"Following prolonged ischemia, if not adequately reperfused, myocardium undergoes necrosis, scarring and thinning. The myocardium tends to dilate in the noninfarcted ventricular area, giving rise to ventricular remodelling. If the ischemic myocardium is adequately reperfused it can be saved and its temporarily depressed functions eventually be recuperated (viable myocardium). The extent of recovery of the postinfarction viable myocardium seems to affect ventricular remodelling. The integrity of the microcirculation of the non-contractile myocardium following prolonged ischemia is fundamental in maintaining a contractile reserve adequate enough for a functional recovery (myocardial viability). Protection of the microcirculation during ischemia-reperfusion is therefore of great importance for the role that the microcirculation plays in ensuring myocardial viability. Experimental studies and initial clinical observations showed that calcium-antagonists exert a beneficial effect in this respect. VAMI is a multicentre, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study whose aim is to ascertain the potentiality of verapamil in limiting regional functional damage in patients with acute myocardial infarction and undergoing early thrombolysis.",,S Iliceto;P Rizzon
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4015910/,Rupture of the myocardium. Occurrence and risk factors,"The occurrence of myocardial rupture was studied in a well defined unselected population of patients with acute myocardial infarction, and the group of patients who died of rupture of the heart were compared with two control groups. Of a total of 3960 patients, 1746 (44%) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for acute myocardial infarction. Rupture was defined solely on the basis of the presence of a pathological passage through part of the myocardium, either the free wall of the left ventricle or the septum, found at necropsy or during operation. Two controls were selected for each patient and matched for age and sex, one (control group A) with acute myocardial infarction having died in hospital but not of rupture (non-rupture cardiac death) and one (control group B) with acute myocardial infarction having survived the hospital stay. Necropsy was performed in 75% of all fatal cases with acute myocardial infarction. The total hospital mortality was 19%, the highest mortality being among women over 70 years (29%). Ruptures (n = 56) were found in 17% of the hospital deaths, or 3.2% of all cases of acute myocardial infarction. Women aged less than 70 had the highest incidence of rupture, 42% of deaths being due to rupture. The mean age for patients with rupture and controls was 70.5 years. The median time after admission to death was approximately 50 hours for patients and control group A. Thirty per cent of the patients with rupture occurred within 24 hours of the initial symptoms occurring. Angina and previous acute myocardial infarction were more common among control group A. Patients with rupture and control group B were mostly relatively free of previous cardiovascular or other diseases (chronic angina pectoris ( > 2 months) and previous myocardial infarction). Sustained hypertension during admission to the coronary care unit was more common in patients than in control group A. Hypotension and shock were more common among control group A. Most (79%) of the patients who subsequently ruptured did not receive any corticosteroids at all during the hospital stay. Severe heart failure and antiarrhythmic treatment were more uncommon among patients than among control group A. Patients with rupture received analgesics approximately three times a day throughout their stay. Control group B received analgesics mostly during the first 24 hours. Thus female patients, patients with first infarcts, and patients with sustained chest pain should be investigated for the possibility of rupture. As many as one third (32%) of ruptures may be subacute, and therefore time is available for diagnosis and surgery.",,M Dellborg;P Held;K Swedberg;A Vedin

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1288838/,Disappearance of Q waves following thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction,"The development of Q waves on the surface electrocardiogram generally is considered indicative of myocardial infarction. Such Q waves are usually permanent, though may regress and disappear over months to years. Transient Q waves have been described during myocardial ischemia without evidence of infarction. More recently, Q waves have been noted to develop transiently during the acute phases of infarction, possibly representing stunned myocardium. In this case report, a patient with an evolving anterior myocardial infarction and new septal Q waves was treated with intravenous thrombolytic therapy. Three hours following treatment the patient was clinically improved, and the septal Q waves had been replaced by small but obvious R waves. Despite a large area of myocardium at risk of infarction on the initial electrocardiogram, the resultant infarction was enzymatically and echocardiographically small. Early Q waves in acutely evolving myocardial infarction may represent severely ischemic, rather than irreversibly damaged, myocardium which may still be salvaged with thrombolytic therapy.",,M K Gupta;P Teefy;J Ross

Myocardial infarction sufferers often delay several hours before seeking medical attention, and most deaths from infarction occur before hospitalization. These two facts indicate that denial may contribute to mortality from coronary artery disease. To encourage ""stoical"" patients to seek medical care, nonthreatening educational approaches to cardiac disease and concentrated efforts to reduce anxiety toward hospitals are needed. Family physicians knowledgeable about the effects of denial can screen cardiac-prone patients for inappropriate denial and alter diagnostic approaches in an attempt to lessen the role denial plays in cardiac deaths.",,K B Fields

Average age was 70 years, for men 68 years and for women 75 years, and 69% of the patients suffered their first acute myocardial infarction. Within six hours 59% of the patients were admitted to hospital and within 12 hours 76%. On admission, 58% of the patients had an electrocardiogram showing ST elevation or bundle branch block. The remainder showed other findings, of which ST depression was the most frequent (23%). In-hospital mortality was 18% and of those discharged 10% died within six months.

Only one case of isolated right ventricle infarction was observed. In other cases it coexisted with left ventricle infarction--most often with inferior myocardial infarction (118 cases, which means 10.7% cases with this localization). Streptokinase was administered to 64 patients with right ventricle infarction, which means 43.5% treated. 10 patients, including 5 female, deceased during the hospitalization, hospital mortality was 6.8%. Cardiogenic shock was the reason of death in all cases. The frequency of concomitant chronic diseases (hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus) and hyperlipidaemia (hypercholesterolaemia and/or hypertriglyceridaemia), as well as arrhythmia and conduction disturbances, in patients with right ventricle myocardial infarction did not differ from the ones estimated in people with left ventricle infarction. According to the analysis of our own material (the most numerous group of patients as juxtaposed to ones observed by other authors) inferior myocardial infarction is most commonly accompanied by right ventricle infarction. Low hospital mortality in these patients is connected with fibrinolytic therapy. The performance of V3R-V5R electrocardiographic leads tracing is indispensable in patients with acute myocardial infarction.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1894538/,Overview: rationale of thrombolysis in treating acute myocardial infarction,"Treatment of coronary thrombosis with thrombolytic agents was first introduced in the 1950s. Clinical trials, primarily with streptokinase during the 1960s and 1970s, addressed the effects of thrombolysis on mortality rates after acute myocardial infarction, but were inconclusive and largely ignored. In 1976, Chazov et al. from the Soviet Union demonstrated that intracoronary streptokinase could produce prompt recanalization of a totally occluded infarct-related artery. In 1980, DeWood et al. demonstrated that 87% of patients with classic Q-wave myocardial infarction had total occlusion from coronary thrombosis of the infarct-related artery when studied during the first 4 hours of their infarction and that 65% of these arteries were still occluded when patients were studied between 12 and 24 hours after infarction. These observations stimulated renewed interest in thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. Mortality trials have subsequently demonstrated that agents such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase, and anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex remarkably reduce early mortality rates among patients with acute myocardial infarction when treatment is instituted within the first 6 hours of infarction. Benefit has yet to be demonstrated, however, in patients with acute myocardial infarction characterized by ST-segment depression. This whole area is currently under study by the TIMI investigators. TIMI-3B is a mortality study in which patients with either non-Q-wave myocardial infarction or unstable angina with rest pain are randomly assigned to receive either tissue plasminogen activator or placebo. Results of this trial will help us in the future to determine the appropriate role of thrombolytic therapy in treating acute ischemic syndromes other than transmural myocardial infarction.",,E Rapaport

Noninvasive and invasive methods have been applied to estimate the extent of the myocardial damage and to monitor the electrical, hemodynamic and metabolic changes during the acute phase. In addition to the use of standard analgesics and antiarrhythmics, measurement of the determinants of left ventricular function by noninvasive and invasive techniques provides a physiologic basis for administration of available pharmacologic agents that can alter the afterload, contractile state, preload, heart rate, metabolic state and infarct size. Information from the Swan-Ganz catheter can describe hemodynamic categories that can be optimally managed by regulation of the left ventricular filling pressure. Patients managed in this manner can be identified for early hospital discharge at 7-10 days. Other patients less than 50 years of age or those experiencing recurrent arrhythmias, ischemic pain or evidence of left ventricular dysfunction may be candidates for coronary arteriography and left ventricular angiography before hospital discharge.",,C E Rackley;R O Russell Jr;J A Mantle;W J Rogers

There exists also a natural substance (intrinsic factor, i.f.) which can also block infarction. The same substances also inhibit arrhythmias of ischaemic origin.

A new dynamic method (T/2 velocity) was elaborated for evaluating anti-infarction drugs instead of using static T/2 values. Oxidation of i.f. in vitro and in vivo enhances the blocking capacity of artificial drugs reagented previously each other. The natural substance (i.f.) lost its blocking capacity after oxygenation, thus may be unable to compete with the above mentioned artificial substances.

The statistical study of the analytical table of the lesions according to severity and site, demonstrated a significant difference in each group (p less than 0,001): --there was a very clear dominance of occlusion of the LAD artery in anterior infarction but severe narrowing (greater than or equal to 70%) was observed mainly on the right coronary and left circumflex arteries; --in inferior infarction, the incidence of occlusion was higher on the right coronary artery and severe narrowing was divided between the LAD and left circumflex arteries. Controlateral, double or triple vessel disease was present in 74% of anterior and 85% of inferior infarcts. There were many more patients with double and triple vessel lesions than with single vessel disease. Residual angina gave no indication of the extension of the lesions in anterior infarction but patients with this complication after inferior infarction had a higher rate of triple vessel disease. Stress testing is exploitable in inferior infarction but did not give any discriminating results. In this series, angina and stress testing only allowed triple vessel disease to be suspected in patients with inferior infarction. A coronary arteriographic study, by showing the severity and controlateral extension of the lesions, comparable in primary anterior and inferior infarction, gives important prognostic information and allows assessment of surgical possibilities.",,F Wolff;P Dumény;J P Bouket;D Grison;G Lassabe;A Sacrez

The severity and extensiveness of lesions demonstrated by coronary arteriography are significantly less in a young patient with an infarction than an elderly patient. Significant isolated coronary artery stenosis is encountered 10 times more frequently before age 35 than after age 50; 15 percent of young patients have no significant stenosis and 8 to 14 percent have entirely normal coronary artery circulation, depending on the study. There appears, then, to be two pathogenetically distinct varieties of MI in the young patient: approximately one-half of cases exhibit multiple sclerosis seen with typical coronary artery atherosclerotic disease; the remainder, which are almost specific for young patients, represent a single obstruction due most often to the rapid development of a thrombosis on an otherwise normal vascular tree.

However, these favourable results are nowadays of importance for the patients concerned only then, when the diagnosis myocardial infarction or the tentative diagnosis infarction are made in a short period and already prehospitally adequate measures are begun. The following measures are in the centre of prehospital care: Immediate home visit when a suspicion of infarction is present, immediate hospitalisation into an in-patient facility, alleviation of pain, immediate treatment of complications (disturbances of cardiac rhythm, shock, pulmonary oedema, cardiac arrest), prevention of disturbances of the cardiac rhythm. According to the modern knowledge is to be assumed that about 50% of the patients with infarction undergo a premonitory stage which lasts for hours, days or weeks. It is possible that here develop concrete approaches to an infarction prophylaxis. In the first place there are an increase of frequency, intensity and duration of the attacks of angina pectoris, insufficient responsiveness to nitrangin, provocation of the attacks by slight causes and changes of the ECG as they are typical for the inner layer and outer layer ischaemia and the so-called rudimentary infarction.

In 3 studies there were substantially lower mortality rates in the exercise patients compared with control patients, but statistically significant differences occurred in only 1 of the 3 trials. No differences between treated and control patients were observed in another trial. In the fifth trial, a slight excess mortality rate was reported for the treatment group.

The progression from ischemia to necrosis of cardiac muscle now can be aborted in a portion of this population by initiating thrombolytic infusions. Early use of thrombolysis in these patients has reduced acute myocardial infarction mortality and morbidity significantly. Although thrombolytic therapy has changed the course of treatment and survival after AMI, there may be time when this approach is contraindicated or unsuccessful. Alternative treatments that may be considered when thrombolytic agents cannot be given, or fail to ameliorate ischemia, are emergent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Future interventional procedures such as intracoronary stents, atherectomy devices, and lasers may be considered as emergent treatment in the near future. It is important to have reviewed when these alternative invasive procedures, some of which are currently experimental, might be considered. Indeed, interventional procedures such as intracoronary stents, atherectomy devices, and laser delivery systems eventually may be accepted as primary therapies for the patient who arrives in the emergency department with an AMI.

Since many patients presenting with ischemic symptoms may have ST elevation (STE) at baseline, not all STE signify transmural ischemia. Benign patterns can be easy to find in some cases. However, patients with benign STE at baseline (left ventricular hypertrophy, early repolarization pattern) may have ongoing ischemia and present with Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or even STEMI superimposed on the benign pattern.

The exact monitoring of the water balance indicated that patients with acute myocardial infarction can safely be given parenteral nutrition. Neither haemodynamic nor metabolic complications occurred in the group with PPN due to the small infusion volume and the continuous administration of the infusion volume and the continuous administration of the infusion.

Although there are several protective mechanisms that may limit the size of the infarction, right ventricular damage can result in right ventricular failure and cardiogenic shock. ECG manifestations of right ventricular infarction can facilitate the early recognition of this syndrome. The standard 12-lead ECG may provide some evidence of infarction of the right ventricle. ST-segment elevation in right precordial leads, however, is far more reliable in establishing a diagnosis. These leads should be recorded immediately if the standard 12-lead ECG reveals an acute inferior wall MI.

Patients in the GISSI I randomized multicenter trial were risk stratified by the ECG. The relative risk (RR) of mortality in the group treated with thrombolytic therapy compared to control subjects was as follows: anterior, 0.75; inferior, 0.94; multiple, 0.61; lateral, 1.22; and prior MI 1.03, thus, indicating subsets with no benefit from thrombolysis (RR > or = 1). The RR was also 1.00 in an overlapping group of 3,539 out of 11,712 patients (30%) with ST elevation limited to two or three leads, indicating a final MI size < 10% of the left ventricle.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1494879/,[Pathogenesis and fundamentals of treatment in acute myocardial infarct],"Recent findings which extend and render more accurate factors which influence the genesis and course of experimental and clinical acute myocardial infarction change in a significant way the treatment and management of patients with acute infarction. The authors discuss the basic factors and complex of interactions which play the most important part in the pathophysiology of acute infarction. They pay attention also to other factors which can influence in a significant way the course of acute infarction and the patient's prognosis (residual thrombosis, rethrombosis, extension, expansion of the infarction and remodelling of the left ventricle). In recent years it has become obvious that the most important determinants of the final extent of acute infarction is the duration and site of occlusion of the coronary artery, its recurrence and degree (magnitude), the condition of the collateral circulation and the consumption and requirements of the myocardium with respect to oxygen during the time of occlusion. The contemporary reperfusion-thrombotic era of treatment of acute myocardial infarction and management of the patient is based on logical multifactorial and to a certain extent preventive, active or aggressive approach and omission of all even potentially harmful approaches. All therapeutic operations (incl. invasive and radical ones) must be consistent with contemporary pathogenetic findings. They should be implemented before possible reinfarction, sudden cardiac death or treatment which has only little effect on heart failure which may be associated also with undesirable expansion of the infarction and remodelling of the left ventricle after acute myocardial infarction. Recent pathophysiological findings and the development of treatment of myocardial infarction are a challenge for cardiologists of the nineties to make use of these important findings in the treatment of patients with myocardial infarction and to ensure for them optimal treatment and management.",,S Cagán;J Dúbrava;H Spitzerová;J Filová
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7137917/,The current status of coronary care units in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction,"Intensive monitoring for patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction first began in USA in 1962. In the past 2 decades, major progress has taken place in the development of coronary care units. The first coronary care unit in Singapore was introduced in 1967. Review of the results obtained from this unit shows that the hospital mortality from acute myocardial infarction can be lowered by intensive cardiac monitoring because of better treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure. However, the outcome of patients with cardiogenic shock is still dismally poor and the mortality in this group of patients is about 85 to 100%. Although the hospital mortality of acute myocardial infarction has been decreased with the introduction of coronary care units, the mortality of this condition in the community is still distressingly high. This is so because the majority of deaths in acute myocardial infarction occur early and outside the hospital environment. Currently the salvage of ischaemic myocardium and the continuing search for an effective treatment for severe pump failure remains the greatest challenge in the present and future management of acute myocardial infarction.",,B L Chia

In order to confirm the presumed location of the infarcted area, the location of the infarcted area on MAP and the location of infarction presumed by the scintigram with thallium-201 (SCG) were compared. MAP was divided into ten regions and a comparison between the presence or absence of an infarcted area in each segment on the MAP and of abnormal findings in each segment of the SCG was made. Consequently, the highest percentage of agreement in each region of the segment in SCG was picked up, and each region on MAP which corresponded to the segment in SCG was determined.

In 267 patients with acute inferior myocardial infarction, 107 had isoelectric anterior ST segments, 84 had minor (less than or equal to 0.5 mm) depression, and 76 had major (greater than 0.5 mm) depression. Patients with anterior ST segment depression had higher serum enzyme levels, higher Norris coronary prognostic indices, and more frequent cardiac failure during the acute stages, but similar 28 day case fatality rate (11.1%) compared with patients without anterior ST segment depression (12.6%). In the subsequent four years total cardiac death rates were not significantly different and the pattern of survival was not influenced, but there was a higher fatal re-infarction rate in patients with major anterior ST segment depression.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11567676/,Thrombolytic therapy in patients of female gender,"Results of surveys and clinical trials have indicated that prognosis of female patients with acute myocardial infarction is worse than prognosis of male patients. Female patients are on average older than male patients, have a longer patient delay, present more often with equivocal ECG abnormalities, and have more often contraindications to thrombolytic therapy. Thrombolytic therapy is given less often to female patients with acute myocardial infarction than to male patients of the same age. This is only partly due to the absence of an indication for thrombolytic therapy or the presence of a contraindication. If thrombolytic therapy is given to female patients with acute myocardial infarction, this results in the same patency rate as in male patients. In the meta-analysis of the Fibrinolytic Therapy Trialists' Collaboration Group that included all randomised clinical trials that compared thrombolytic therapy with a placebo or control group, the absolute benefit of thrombolytic therapy with regard to 35-day mortality was 2.2% in female patients, higher than the observed absolute difference of 1.9% in male patients. In several studies age, gender, and body weight were identified as independent risk factors for the occurrence of stroke and bleeding complications after administration of thrombolytic therapy. Results of the ASSENT-2 study indicated that total stroke rate and 30-day mortality was lower in female patients over 75 years of age treated with tenecteplase than in those treated with alteplase, albeit that the difference was statistically not significant. With the data presently available it can be stated that female patients and patients over 75 years of age will probably benefit more from a thrombolytic agent that is given according to a weight-adjusted dose regimen, e.g., tenecteplase.",,F Vermeer

Following the rehabilitation, 99 patients underwent programmed controls for a mean period of 23.4 +/- 16 months. Anamnestic data, site of the infarction, early exercise test response, rehabilitation results were statistically evaluated. They were compared with the follow-up data to estimate their predictive value of late cardiac events. Only the exercise testing data were found to be of prognostic significance. In fact, 77.8% of patients with ischemic response to the test had new cardiac events in the follow-up period. The percentage of late cardiac events was 26.7% in patients with hypotensive response and 8.4% in patients with normal response. The ischemic response was found to be more frequent in patients with inferior myocardial infarction. The highest rate of new cardiac events (86%) occurred in patients with inferior infarction and ischemic response to the early exercise test.

In all, 64% had anterior ST-segment depression. These patients differed from those not having ST depression in several aspects. They had larger infarcts, as assessed by serum enzyme activity and ECG recording. They were more prone to congestive heart failure and required more treatment for this complication. Their intensity and duration of pain during the first 4 days appeared to be more substantial. During a 5-year follow-up, patients with anterior ST depression tended to have a higher mortality. We conclude that among patients with inferior myocardial infarction and no previous infarction, those with anterior ST-segment depression form a subgroup with a more severe clinical course.",,J Herlitz;A Hjalmarson

The results were analysed in four groups of patients (patients with anterior, anterior and right ventricular, posterior, posterior and right ventricular myocardial infarction). Furthermore, the relation between left and right ventricular ejection fraction, stress capacity and heart volume was investigated. There was no influence of the age and gender of patients on the observed values of right and left ventricular ejection fraction.

The right ventricular ejection fraction was normal in patients with ""poor"" left ventricular infarction, and it was decreased in patients with right ventricular myocardial infarction. The right ventricular ejection fraction did not influence the stress capacity and the heart volume of the patients. The left ventricular ejection fraction found to be less in anterior, compared to posterior myocardial infarction. This difference was independent on the presence of right ventricular infarction.

Analysis of the two groups (including such high-risk factors as congestive heart failure, tachyarrhythmias, previous infarction, cardiac enlargement, and other unfavorable manifestations) failed to reveal a reduction in mortality after introduction of the ICCU. Thus, the value of the ICCU cannot be demonstrated in terms of mortality.

The decision to institute intravenous thrombolytic therapy, which has revolutionised the treatment of myocardial infarction in recent years, requires the presence of ST segment elevation and a suggestive clinical history.

The value of thrombolytic therapy has not been demonstrated in patients without ST elevation, especially considering the usually favourable prognosis of infarcts with normal ECGs or with only non-specific repolarisation changes. The initial ECG provides information about infarct size which is an essential prognostic factor. This evaluation is based on the topography (anterior or inferior), the amplitude of ST elevation and the number of leads in which these changes are observed. The initial analysis has two objectives: to evaluate the risk/benefit ratio of treatment in cases of relative contraindications to thrombolysis or with a doubtful diagnosis; to select high risk patients (extensive infarcts) who may benefit from ""salvage angioplasty"" in the event of failure of thrombolysis: coronary angiography should be programmed from the onset as the ECG outcome does not allow prediction of the results of thrombolysis for the majority of these patients.",,G Leroy;R Haïat

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2136467/,[Electrocardiographic diagnosis and classification of acute coronary attacks],"In clinical practice the use of terms transmural and non-transmural infarction, based on the evaluation of the electrocardiogram is abandoned, as the correlation of an abnormal Q wave and transmural infarction and its absence in non-transmural ischaemic lesions is inadequate. A cardiac infarction with a Q wave and a non-Q wave infarction have certain different clinical and prognostic characteristics. A non-Q infarction is characterized during hospitalization usually by more frequent episodes of angina pectoris and a lower mortality than infarction with a Q wave. The depression of the ST segment in a standard electrocardiogram in acute coronary attacks is not a more benign phenomenon than its elevation. From the aspect of long-term prognosis the sub-group of patients specially at risk are those with marked depressions of the ST segment. A non-Q infarction, even if of smaller extent, is an unstable form of ischaemic heart disease and therefore in these patients more intense and post-hospitalization monitoring for a so-called vulnerable heart muscle is justified. The basic classification of the ECG in acute coronaries into infarctions with and without a Q wave is inadequate, unless based on the corresponding pathological correlate as patients with non-Q infarctions are not a homogeneous group. The way to obtain optimal electrocardiographic informations and their classification in acute myocardial infarction is to evaluate electrocardiograms where not only changes in the initial portion of the QRS complex are evaluated but also changes in its medium and end portions, changes of ST segments and T waves as well as their combinations, distribution and duration.",,S Cagán;L Kuchárová

Recent advances in emergency coronary bypass surgery, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and thrombolytic therapy have provided methods for effective treatment of acute myocardial infarction. However, several observations indicate this issue is more complex. Although blood flow must be restored to ischemic myocardium if it is to survive, animal experiments suggest potential deleterious effects associated with this reperfusion. These deleterious effects may be associated with unstable ST segments reported early after acute infarct thrombolysis. Though recurrent coronary occlusion cannot be excluded, reperfusion injury in this setting of coronary artery patency must be considered. This case illustrates this proposed reperfusion injury reflected as ""tombstone"" ST segment elevation in a patient following successful acute infarct PTCA.",,J Dalal;C E Chambers

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8402744/,[The variability of the heart rate in patients with a myocardial infarct undergoing systemic fibrinolysis interventions],"Although heart rate variability is a very important prognostic factor in patients with myocardial infarction, the mechanism for the reduction in the vagal cardiac activity is unknown: myocardial infarction can cause local areas of sympathetic or parasympathetic denervation that leads to catecholamine hypersensitivity; the destruction of local ventricular receptors of the autonomic system may alter feedback to the higher centres, impairing autonomic regulation; the mechanical distortion consequent to the infarction can give rise to sympathetic overactivity. Effective thrombolysis in myocardial infarction could reduce myocardial necrosis and, therefore, cause less reduction of vagal activity and/or less sympathetic stimulation. To determine whether systemic thrombolysis has some effect on heart rate variability we studied 40 patients with a first transmural myocardial infarction. Enrollment criteria were very strict: all the patients with conditions potentially influencing heart rate variability were excluded from this study. Between day 15 and day 25 from the infarction patients had an Holter monitoring. A program we developed provided for the automatic identification of R wave, for the calculation of RR interval, and for the recognition of pause, extrasystolic and post-extrasystolic beats, that could be thus excluded from the analysis. Patients were divided in 2 groups: 17 patients treated with thrombolysis and 23 subjects treated traditionally.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4015011/,[Prognosis of the acute stage of myocardial infarction. Rhythm factors],"At the present time, it is still difficult to determine the real prognostic significance of cardiac arrhythmias in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. The metabolic and electrogenic consequences of myocardial ischaemia are responsible for the principal mechanisms involved in the development of arrhythmias in the ICU: conduction disorders and/or ventricular arrhythmias. Based on a review of the literature, the author analyses the prognostic value of the principal arrhythmias: branch block, atrio-ventricular block, primary ventricular fibrillation and repetitive or isolated ventricular extrasystoles. A number of conclusions can be drawn from this study: isolated arrhythmias in the acute phase are a sign of metabolic and electrolyte disorders and only influence the immediate prognosis. The same arrhythmias, associated with anatomical damage, altered myocardial function or heart failure, may be the sign of severe, long term complications. The development of arrhythmias in the acute phase of infarction should not be interpreted in isolation, but together with the results of further investigations to test the value of the myocardium and the electrical instability. The patient's real risk can only be evaluated on the basis of all of these findings.",,J M Gilgenkrantz
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2973377/,Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty improves survival in acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock,"Modest survival benefits have been reported in patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock who were treated with early surgical revascularization or thrombolytic therapy. To determine whether coronary angioplasty improves survival, 87 patients with cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, from 1975 to 1985 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients in group 1 (n = 59) were treated with conventional therapy; patients in group 2 (n = 24) were treated with conventional therapy and angioplasty. Extent of coronary artery disease, infarct location, and incidence of multivessel disease were similar between groups. Hemodynamic variables including cardiac index, mean arterial pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were also similar. The 30-day survival was significantly improved for group 2 patients (50% vs. 17%, p = 0.006). Survival in group 2 patients with successful angioplasty was 77% (10 of 13 patients) versus 18% (two of 11 patients) in patients with unsuccessful angioplasty, (p = 0.006). The findings suggest that angioplasty improves survival in cardiogenic shock compared with conventional therapy with survival contingent upon successful reperfusion of the infarct-related artery.",,L Lee;E R Bates;B Pitt;J A Walton;N Laufer;W W O'Neill

We studied the records of 101 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction whose admission ECG demonstrated ST segment elevation with positive T waves, without pathological Q waves in the relevant leads, and without signs of bundle branch block or left ventricular hypertrophy. Thirty-five patients had 44 episodes of early ST segment reelevation, while 22 patients experienced 26 late episodes of ST segment reelevation. Seven patients experienced both early and late episodes. Early episodes of ST segment reelevation was seen more often after thrombolytic therapy: 43% (32 of 74 patients) versus 11% (3 of 27 patients) (P < 0.006). No differences were found in the incidence of late episodes between those who underwent (23%) or did not undergo (19%) thrombolytic therapy. Two patterns of ST segment elevation were distinguished. Pattern A with positive T waves, ST segment elevation (> or = 0.1 mV), but without distortion of the terminal portion of the QRS complex. Pattern B characterized by positive T waves, ST segment elevation (> or = 0.1 mV) with distortion of the terminal portion of the QRS complex. Each ECG was categorized according to these two patterns. The admission ECG pattern was A in 75 patients, and B in 26. No significant differences were found between patients with early, late, or no episodes of ST segment reelevation in the appearance of pattern A or B on admission.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,Y Birnbaum;S Sclarovsky;D Hasdai;I Burstein;J Kusniec;B Strasberg
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/477333/,Estimation of size of infarcted focus by spatial quantitative vectorcardiography in patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction,"The study included 113 patients with acute myocardial infarction of the left ventricular anterior wall. The patients were repeatedly followed up from the first hours of the affection onward in the course of the individual stages of treatment (stage of intensive monitoring and therapy; intermediate stage; initial rehabilitation with application of active therapy; early mobilization, activation and rehabilitation). A new approach to the estimation of the size of the infarcted focus is described, namely, the method using spatial quantitative vectorcardiography. It was found that the spatial localization of the 40-ms vector, especially its azimuth, is a specific indicator, with the aid of which the localization, extent and depth of the lesion in the left ventricular anterior wall can be assessed with a high probability in most instances. The compensatory adaptive and reparative capacity of the affected myocardium, estimated on the basis of spatial quantitative VCG, is closely correlated with the size of the infarcted focus.",,Z L Dolabchian;E S Mikaelian
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24682962/,The effect of myocardial infarct size on cardiac reserve in rhesus monkeys,"Evaluation of cardiac reserve under myocardial infarction in patients is important for prognosis. However, this evaluation is difficult to be done due to high risk for mortality in patients with severe myocardial infarction. The present study was undertaken using non-human primate model as a substitute for humans to investigate the relationship between cardiac reserve and myocardial infarct size. Rhesus monkeys of 2-3 years old (n = 27) were subjected to left anterior descending artery ligation to introduce acute myocardial infarction. By altering the ligation position along the artery, varying sizes of myocardial infarction were generated, from 20 to 58 % of the total myocardium mass. These subjects were divided into 4 groups based on the infarct size: below 25 %, between 25 and 35 %, between 35 and 45 %, and above 45 % of the total mass. Changes in cardiac contractility were determined by echocardiography along with the development of myocardial infarction, and by invasive hemodynamic measurement at the end of the experiment. Correlation analysis revealed that hearts with infarct sizes <25 % of the total mass fully responded to the increase in the load generated by heart rate escalation. Hearts with infarct sizes between 25 and 45 % responded the load increase with gradient decline in the maximum contractility. Hearts with infarct sizes more than 45 % failed to respond to the increase in the load. Therefore, we consider myocardial infarct size <25 % of the total mass as compensable injury, between 25 and 45 % as depleting injury, and more than 45 % as exhausted injury with regard to cardiac reserve. This would serve as a surrogate model for patients with myocardial infarction.",,Jindan Cai;Xiaorong Sun;Pengfei Han;Ying Xiao;Xin Fan;Yanwen Shang;Y James Kang
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8013502/,Differences between patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic myocardial infarction: the relevance of psychological factors,"Several hypotheses describe the phenomenon asymptomatic myocardial infarction (MI) blockade of afferent cardiac nerves, pain inhibition by endogenous opioids, and insufficient severity of myocardial ischaemia. Psychological factors, however, are rarely considered. The present study involved 35 asymptomatic (AMI) and 35 symptomatic patients (SMI) selected from a sample of 199 patients with myocardial infarction. During observation in a rehabilitation clinic, the following were assessed: biochemical variables; ECG at rest, at exercise, and during Holter monitoring; and a special 23 h monitoring of physical activity, ECG changes, and subjective feelings. Psychological assessments with questionnaires were also performed and comprised: personality evaluation; physical complaints; possible predisposing features for the development of MI; expectations regarding the benefit of rehabilitation; circumstances at the time of infarction; and socioeconomic and historical data. The hypothesis that physiological factors might explain the differences between AMI and SMI is not substantiated by our results. However, the hypothesis of the role of psychological factors is supported. As opposed to AMI patients, SMI patients are characterized by frequent complaints of poor health, neuroticism, and introversion. At the time of infarction, SMI patients had more frequent premonitory symptoms of longer duration. Moreover, SMI patients had more frequent previous hospital or nursing home admissions. At the end of the rehabilitation treatment, only 43% of the SMI patients were judged by their physician as fit for work as against 71% of the AMI patients.",,M Myrtek;A Fichtler;K König;G Brügner;W Müller

Eight died from three days to three years after diagnosis (overall mortality 47%). The nine survivors, now aged 2-17 years, have been followed for one to 10 years (mean follow up five years) after infarction. The commonest causes of myocardial infarction in this series were anomalous origin of left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (six patients (35%] and Kawasaki disease (five patients (27%]. The main symptoms of acute myocardial infarction were dyspnoea, vomiting, and difficulty feeding. Diagnosis was made in all patients by electrocardiography and confirmed by echocardiography, cardiac catheterisation, or at operation. All survivors were symptom free with excellent exercise capacity. The left ventricular ejection fraction in survivors ranged from 21% to 66%, and only one child was on regular cardiac medications. There were no cases of late sudden death. Twenty four hour Holter monitoring performed on survivors was normal (seven) or showed minor abnormalities only (one), suggesting that serious arrhythmia is rare after paediatric myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction in children had a high early mortality; however, the incidence of serious arrhythmia was low in the survivors, who had a good exercise tolerance even when the left ventricular ejection fraction was low.",,D S Celermajer;G F Sholler;R Howman-Giles;J M Celermajer

Microvascular dysfunction occurs in a substantial proportion of patients, despite aggressive therapy with thrombolytic agents and/or percutaneous mechanical revascularization techniques. Patients with impaired microvascular perfusion after immediate reperfusion therapy have an adverse clinical prognosis. Recent studies have extended our understanding of the pathophysiology of this so-called no-reflow phenomenon, focusing on the critical roles of platelet and inflammatory mediators leading to microvascular obstruction and reperfusion injury. Moving beyond the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade system, new techniques have been developed to assess microvascular perfusion, including TIMI frame counting, angiographic myocardial perfusion grading, myocardial contrast echocardiography, Doppler flow wire studies, nuclear scintigraphy, and magnetic resonance imaging.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23138671/,Acute myocardial infarction after noncardiac surgery,"Over 230 million surgeries are performed annually worldwide, cardiac complications being the most common causes of postoperative morbidity and mortality. As life expectancy has extended worldwide, a growing number of patients with multiple comorbidities have undergone noncardiac surgeries. Consequently, cardiovascular complications associated with those procedures are expected to increase, and perioperative acute myocardial infarction (AMI) might become a frequent problem. In Brazil, the number of noncardiac surgical procedures has also increased, and approximately three million surgeries are performed annually. Despite advances in surgical and anesthetic techniques, mortality and costs related to those procedures have also increased, thus, requiring the development of strategies to reduce mortality(4).

Some studies have also suggested that thrombolytic therapy may improve survival even when initiated 6-24 hours after the onset of symptoms by mechanisms other than infarct size limitation, such as reduced expansion, reduced electrical instability, and improved healing of the infarct. However, in view of the possibility that late thrombolytic therapy may also be associated with an increased risk of cardiac rupture, the risk-benefit ratio needs to be more clearly defined.

Clinical echocardiographic and pathological aspects],"Dissection of the inferior wall of the right ventricle during the acute phase of myocardial infarction with right ventricular involvement is a mechanical complication which has been recently identified, the diagnosis being almost exclusively post-mortem. The authors report the clinical, echocardiographic and pathological features of myocardial dissection in four patients. Between 1985 and 1988, the diagnosis of myocardial dissection was made by echocardiography in 4 patients aged 77 to 80 years, admitted to hospital for an acute inferior wall myocardial infarction. All 4 patients had signs of acute right ventricular failure indicating right ventricular necrosis and a loud systolic murmur at the left sternal border; 2 patients were in shock. The ECG showed signs of inferior wall infarction with, in 2 patients, electrical changes suggestive of right ventricular involvement. Echocardiography showed dissection of the inferior wall of the right ventricle as a pulsatile, echo-free space in the diaphragmatic wall of the right ventricle which appeared to obstruct right ventricular ejection in end systole to a variable degree. The outcome was fatal in all cases with death resulting from refractory myocardial failure. Pathological analysis confirmed biventricular inferior wall infarction also involving the posterior part of the interventricular system, the site of a small tear on the left side which communicated with a neo-cavity dissecting the RV posterior wall. The right coronary artery was totally occluded in all cases. The anatomical lesions were fully concordant with the echocardiographic data: the dissection filled with blood from the left ventricle at each systole creating a pulsatile space in the diaphragmatic wall of the ventricle obstructing ejection.",,P Scanu;G Grollier;E Lamy;P Commeau;B Valette;T Lognone;D Granger;F Galateau;J C Potier

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3591606/,Evolution of regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities in acute Q and non-Q wave myocardial infarction,"The evolution of segmental wall motion in Q and non-Q wave acute myocardial infarction was studied in detail in 15 patients without known prior ischemic events. Serial two-dimensional echocardiographic studies were performed beginning early after the onset of chest pain and continuing until 10 to 14 days after admission. An area of apparent infarction was identified on each initial study based on later correlation of ECG and echocardiographic findings. Wall motion of infarct-and noninfarct-related areas was graded in a semiquantitative fashion based on the scoring of a visual analysis. Sequential image data demonstrated significant spontaneous improvement in wall motion of the infarct area in non-Q but not in Q wave events. Patients with non-Q wave infarction and improvement in regional function were at high risk for recurrent infarction within 6 months. Improvement in wall motion inside or outside the area of infarction in Q wave events was related to future risk. We concluded that in patients with initial acute myocardial infarction, failure to develop Q waves correlated with return of function in the apparent area of infarction. Improvement in regional wall motion after the initial study suggested risk for future ischemic events in both ECG types of myocardial infarction. Serial echocardiographic imaging may be a means to identify patients at risk for infarct extension in both non-Q and Q wave events.",,H Mahias-Narvarte;K F Adams;P W Willis
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3361703/,"Relationship between abnormal Q waves in lead aVL and angiographic findings--a study to redefine ""high lateral"" infarction","To re-evaluate the concept of ""high lateral"" myocardial infarction, angiographic findings were analysed in 29 patients with remote infarction and abnormal Q waves in lead I or aVL but no abnormal Q waves in other leads and no prominent R wave in lead V1. All patients except one showed asynergy in the anterior segment on right anterior oblique left ventriculogram. Asynergies in other segments were, if present, mild or small. Critical narrowing was present in the diagonal branches or in their ""parent"" arteries (that is, the left anterior descending artery or left main trunk) in 28 patients but in the circumflex artery in only 3 patients. Thus, the traditional concept that a ""high lateral"" infarction is myocardial necrosis of the basal aspect of the left ventricle, receiving its blood supply from the circumflex artery, needs correction. ""High lateral infarction"" corresponds to necrosis of the area between the obtuse margin and the interventricular groove ordinarily supplied by the diagonal branches of the left anterior descending artery.

It was a common condition in this age group (9.8% of the population) with a female predominance (61.8%), the main risk factor begin hypertension. A previous history of angina or infarctions, silent ischaemia, atypical electrocardiographic forms and anterior infarction were significantly more common. The outcome was characterised by a higher prevalence of haemodynamic complications with cardiac failure in 60% of cases and cardiogenic shock in 10% of cases. Atrial fibrillation was also more common though severe ventricular arrythmias were more infrequent. From the therapeutic point of view, 95.7% of octogenarians were given intravenous heparin but thrombolysis was undertaken in only one case. Coronary angiography, angioplasty and cardiac surgery were exceptional. Hospital mortality was 26.7%, seven times higher than that observed in patients under 65 years of age and nearly twice that of patients 65 to 79 years of age. After hospital admission, 45% of octogenarians were prescribed a calcium inhibitor, 37.2% a platelet anti-aggregant agent, 17.2% long-term oral anticoagulants and 1.9% a betablocker.

The purposes of the study were to test the safety and therapeutic efficacy of high acoustic energy diagnostic ultrasound in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction subjected to a low (n=199) or high (n=251) mechanical index ultrasound before and after percutaneous coronary interventions and echocardiographic parameters were evaluated. Coronary angiographies were performed for the assessment of culprit vessels. Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade 1 or 2 were considered as culprit vessels. RESULTS Patients diagnosed through low acoustic energy ultrasound reported 235 infarct vessels and patients diagnosed through high acoustic energy ultrasound reported 300 infarct vessels. With respect to low acoustic energy, high acoustic energy reduced the number of culprit vessels at post-percutaneous coronary interventions at 48 hours before hospital discharge (P=0.015) and post-percutaneous coronary interventions at 1-month from the baseline interventions (P=0.043). Also, the maximum% ST-segment resolution and an ejection fraction of the left ventricle was increased and microvascular coronary obstruction in infarct vessels was decreased for both evaluation points. High acoustic energy could not affect heart rate (P=0.133) and oxygen saturation (P=0.079).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9156927/,[Remodeling of the left ventricle after myocardial infarction],"Cardiac remodeling following myocardial infarction denotes changes of left ventricular shape, chamber size and wall thickness. It involves both the infarcted and the noninfarcted segments. This process begins at the time of acute myocardial infarction, progresses by stages, and can lead to congestive heart failure. The major determinants of lest ventricular remodeling are infarct size and transmural, adequacy of the healing process, mechanical deformation forces, and progressive ventricular dilation. Infarct expansion is a relatively frequent, early occurring alteration of the ventricular shape. It denotes thinning and lengthening of the infarct segment. The progressive ventricular remodeling can be halted by reactive hypertrophy of the viable myocytes, on condition that it is appropriate. The left ventricular increase results from myocytes hypertrophy, partly their hyperplasia, and increase of fibrosis. Major ways of action in order to limit the cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction are: reperfusion of the infarct-related vessel by thrombolysis, nitrate therapy, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors administration. Maximum benefit is when therapy is begun very early.",,E Droździak;W Piwowarska

Unfortunately, a minority of patients in Australia present within 2 h of symptom onset and most patients receive reperfusion 3-4 h after. So health professionals begin at a disadvantage. A novel approach to this problem has been to give thrombolysis at first contact with the patient, before admission to hospital.

In this present study, 41 rats underwent temporary myocardial ischemia of variable duration using left coronary artery ligation. They were sacrificed at 48 hours, and the heart was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Serial 8 micrometer sections of known intervals were tested for succinodehydrogenase (NBT stain). Gross sectional areas measured planimetrically were utilized to calculate total myocardial volume (Vmyocardium) and infarcted myocardial volume (Vinfarct) with the aid of a programmable calculator.

These therapies are aimed at improving myocardial perfusion with the ultimate improvement or restoration of myocardial function. Two-dimensional echocardiography with digital storage and display is an ideal technique for temporally monitoring regional ventricular function and the effectiveness of interventional therapy. By design, 2-dimensional echocardiography is noninvasive and can be performed conveniently at the bedside. For these reasons, echocardiography is the principal imaging technique at Indiana University Hospital for patients with acute myocardial infarction. Computer retrieval of echocardiograms can be achieved in about 10 seconds at the nurses' station in the coronary care unit. With the availability of such an examination, the physician has a better understanding of the site, size and function of the infarct area. The state of the noninfarcted myocardium is also assessed and may be critical to the patient's prognosis. With the digital recordings, serial studies can be displayed side-by-side, making it easier for the physician to follow the natural history or to judge the effect of therapy. Echocardiography also is useful in identifying many complications that can occur with myocardial infarction.

Continuous monitoring has advantages over repeated snapshot recordings. There are four electrocardiographic markers for prediction of the perfusion status of the ischemic myocardium: (1) ST-segment measurements, (2) T-wave configuration, (3) QRS changes, and (4) reperfusion arrhythmias. Complete and stable (> or = 70%) resolution of ST-segment elevation is associated with better outcome and preservation of left ventricular function than partial (30 to 70%) or no (<30%) ST-segment resolution. Early inversion of the T waves after initiation of reperfusion therapy is another marker of myocardial reperfusion and a good prognostic sign. Using standard 12-lead ECG, dynamic changes in Q-wave number, amplitude, and width; R-wave amplitude; and S-wave appearance are detected during reperfusion therapy. However, the significance of these changes has not been clarified. Reperfusion arrhythmias, especially bradycardia and accelerated idioventricular rhythm, are detected occasionally during reperfusion therapy, but the value of reperfusion arrhythmias as a marker of coronary artery patency is still debatable. Dynamic changes in the QRS complexes, ST segments and T waves occur during reperfusion therapy and the days after. Whereas changes in ST-segment amplitude have been extensively studied, the significance of QRS-complex and T-wave changes is less clear, and especially whether changes in the QRS complex and T wave may be complementary and additive to ST-segment monitoring. It has remained unclear whether electrocardiographic signs of reperfusion and reischemia should be used for therapeutic decision making in the clinical setting.",,M Vaturi;Y Birnbaum

This is mainly due to the fact that with the current therapeutic regimens early, optimal tissue reperfusion is obtained in only a small percentage of patients with an acute myocardial infarction. However, recanalization of an occluded coronary vessel in itself has beneficial effects by mechanisms other than salvage of ischemic myocardium and preservation of left ventricular function. In view of the striking relationship between reperfusion (early or late) and survival as recently demonstrated by the GUSTO study, new therapeutic developments must be aimed at increasing the percentage of early, optimal and persistent reperfusion.",,F Van de Werf
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28866415/,Psychological sequelae of myocardial infarction,"Patient with myocardial infarction (MI) are often affected by psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Psychological disorders are disabling and have a negative influence on recovery, reduce the quality of life and causes high mortality rate in MI patients. Despite tremendous advancement in technologies, screening scales, and treatment strategies, psychological sequelae of MI are currently understudied, underestimated, underdiagnosed, and undertreated. Depression is highly prevalent in MI patients followed by anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Pathophysiological factors involved in psychopathologies observed in patients with MI are sympathetic over-activity, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction, and inflammation. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies evidenced a positive association between MI and psychopathologies with a common molecular pathophysiology. This review provides an update on diagnostic feature, prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical outcomes, and management strategies of psychopathologies associated with MI.

Proximal occlusion of this artery leads to electrocardiographically identifiable right-heart ischemia and an increased risk of death in the presence of acute inferior infarction. Clinical recognition begins with the ventricular electrocardiographic manifestations: inferior left ventricular ischemia (ST segment elevation in leads II, III and aVF), with or without accompanying abnormal Q waves and right ventricular ischemia (ST segment elevation in right chest leads V3R through V6R and ST segment depression in anterior leads V2 through V4). Associated findings may include atrial infarction (PR segment displacement, elevation or depression in leads II, III and aVF), symptomatic sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular node block and atrial fibrillation. Hemodynamic effects of right ventricular dysfunction may include failure of the right ventricle to pump sufficient blood through the pulmonary circuit to the left ventricle, with consequent systemic hypotension.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20703720/,Detection and localization of myocardial infarction using K-nearest neighbor classifier,"This paper presents automatic detection and localization of myocardial infarction (MI) using K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier. Time domain features of each beat in the ECG signal such as T wave amplitude, Q wave and ST level deviation, which are indicative of MI, are extracted from 12 leads ECG. Detection of MI aims to classify normal subjects without myocardial infarction and subjects suffering from Myocardial Infarction. For further investigation, Localization of MI is done to specify the region of infarction of the heart. Total 20,160 ECG beats from PTB database available on Physio-bank is used to investigate the performance of extracted features with KNN classifier. In the case of MI detection, sensitivity and specificity of KNN is found to be 99.9% using half of the randomly selected beats as training set and rest of the beats for testing. Moreover, Arif-Fayyaz pruning algorithm is used to prune the data which will reduce the storage requirement and computational cost of search. After pruning, sensitivity and specificity are dropped to 97% and 99.6% respectively but training is reduced by 93%. Myocardial Infarction beats are divided into ten classes based on the location of the infarction along with one class of normal subjects. Sensitivity and Specificity of above 90% is achieved for all eleven classes with overall classification accuracy of 98.8%. Some of the ECG beats are misclassified but interestingly these are misclassified to those classes whose location of infarction is near to the true classes of the ECG beats. Pruning is done on the training set for eleven classes and training set is reduced by 70% and overall classification accuracy of 98.3% is achieved. The proposed method due to its simplicity and high accuracy over the PTB database can be very helpful in correct diagnosis of MI in a practical scenario.",,Muhammad Arif;Ijaz A Malagore;Fayyaz A Afsar

After successful angioplasty, coronary blood flow velocity was measured with a coronary Doppler catheter before and during intraaortic balloon pumping. Although mean coronary blood flow velocity was unchanged, intraaortic balloon pumping increased peak coronary blood flow velocity from 34.6 +/- 5.0 cm/sec (mean +/- SEM) to 46.7 +/- 5.8 cm/sec (p < 0.005).

Twenty patients with old myocardial infarction (3-6 weeks) were included in an exercise training programme (mainly cycloergometer) for 2 to 8 weeks. Before and after the exercise training programme, the effort capacity and LV systolic function were determined through exercise testing on cycloergometer and echocardiography. The peak effort raised from 4.39 to 5.27 METs (p < 0.05) and the difference DAF-DAM was reduced from 25% to 12% (p < 0.05). The double product (DP) at peak effort raised nonsignificantly (4.91%, p > > 0.05), but at submaximal effort levels DP decreased significantly on each effort step (12.16%, p < < 0.05). In turn, LV systolic function calculated parameters were practically the same before and after the exercise training programme. (EDD 54.3 vs 5.3 mm, ESD 39.3 vs 38 mm, EDV 160 vs 169 ml, ESV 60.6 vs 54.8 ml, EF 54.1% vs 57.8%, SF 27.6% vs 31.2%). It is concluded that exercise training raised the effort capacity in patients with old myocardial infarction, mainly through peripheral mechanisms, LV systolic function being unchanged.

In the long run implantation of permanent metallic implants have negative effect the biological behavior of the target vessel with a continuous low device failure over the years. Recently, however, efforts have been realized to tackle these shortcomings and optimize mechanical reperfusion by improvements to stent design, as substantiated by the self-expanding stent, the mesh-covered stent and the bioresorbable vascular scaffold. In this article, we provide an overview of the role of these novel, innovatively designed, alternative devices in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.",ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; bioresorbable scaffold; mesh-covered stents; primary percutaneous coronary intervention; self-expanding stent.,Tuncay Yetgin;Shimpei Nakatani;Yoshinobu Onuma;Robert-Jan M van Geuns

There is a strong need to deliver reperfusion therapy as soon as possible, with primary percutaneous coronary intervention being the preferred option if performed in a timely manner and thrombolytic therapy, particularly in the prehospital setting, being a good alternative if the primary percutaneous coronary intervention-related delay exceeds the equipoise. In this situation, emergency medical services have a primary role in rescuing patients from cardiac arrest, performing prehospital diagnosis, triage and treatment and safely transporting them to the most appropriate cardiological center, including interhospital transfer.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1729877/,Clinical benefits of thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction,"The value of coronary artery reperfusion resulting from pharmacologically induced fibrinolysis in patients with evolving myocardial infarction has been rigorously evaluated. Improved left ventricular function and even more impressive improvements in survival rates have been demonstrated consistently in controlled studies. Benefit is related to the restoration of myocardial blood flow. Maximal benefit is achieved with early and sustained restoration of coronary artery patency. Benefits observed during initial hospitalization are sustained for at least 1 year in the majority of patients, even without subsequent mechanical revascularization. To date, analysis of subgroups has not identified a population of patients with evolving infarction that should routinely be excluded from consideration for thrombolysis. As with many potent pharmacologic agents, activators of the fibrinolytic system are associated with a degree of risk whenever they are administered to a patient. Therefore, patients must be assessed carefully prior to initiating treatment, especially for potential bleeding hazards, and appropriate follow-up evaluation and concomitant therapy needs to be planned. However, given the overwhelming body of data now available regarding its benefits and relative safety, thrombolysis should be considered as conventional therapy for patients with acute evolving myocardial infarction (AMI).",,A J Tiefenbrunn

With the combination of total occlusion of at least one coronary artery and abnormal systolic contraction of at least part of the left ventricle as the best available documentation of myocardial disease, sensitivity and specificity were 70% and 67%, respectively, using electrocardiographic criteria and 80% and 73% using polarcardiographic criteria, for both anterior and inferior myocardial infarction. Another polarcardiographic criterion--rightward shift in R latitude at 10 msec after onset of QRS--occurred concurrently with vessel occulusion in 16 of 17 patients (94%), in four of whom this was the only objective evidence of myocardial infarction, and three of whom there was no manifest abnormality of wall contraction. This criterion is considered evidence of non-transmural myocardial infarction, probably in the subendocardial layer near the apex of the left ventricle.

It is specific for acute myocardial necrosis, as opposed to ischemia or chronic infarction, and therefore identifies patients who have had an acute MI. It is most useful in patients whose ECGs are indeterminate for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (eg, left bundle branch block or permanent pacemaker) or those with inconclusive CK or CK-MB. Diagnostic accuracy and safety of antimyosin imaging has been established. This new cardiac imaging agent holds great potential for future clinical use in the diagnosis and management of patients with known or suspected acute myocardial infarction. Presuming FDA approval, the critical care nurse will see antimyosin used as an innovative and viable alternative in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. Critical care nurses need to continually increase their knowledge of technologic advances and clinical applications for their own professional development, as well as to provide accurate information to patients and their families.

A thallium-201 cardiac scan consistent with previous anterior (septal) myocardial infarction was present in seven patients. In these patients there was no significant increase in RV3 amplitude when recorded one interspace below the conventional site. In the nine patients with a thallium-201 cardiac scan negative for old anterior myocardial infarction, RV3 amplitude increased from 2.2 +/- 0.4 mm to 6.4 +/- 1.2 mm. Patients with or without associated old anterior myocardial infarction could be better diagnosed by consideration of RV3 amplitude as recorded from one interspace lower, as compared with conventional electrode placement. All five patients with RV3 (lower interspace) less than 2 mm had associated anterior infarction, and all seven patients with RV3 (lower interspace) greater than 3 mm did not.

Most of the patients who sustain myocardial infarction have coronary atherosclerosis. There are several risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis. Among all the risk factors, vitamin D deficiency has been proposed to play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis. With this aim, a case-control study was carried out to explore the association of serum vitamin D with acute myocardial infarction. The enrolled study subjects were categorized into Group A which comprised of STEMI, Group B, comprised of NSTEMI and Group C comprised of age and sex matched individuals free from acute myocardial infarction. The mean values of serum vitamin D (in ng/ml) were 20.17, 20.8 and 24.77 respectively in STEMI, NSTEMI and control groups. It differed significantly among groups (p<0.001) and it was significantly low in STEMI and NSTEMI groups compared to control group (p<0.001 and p=0.004). From this study it can be concluded that low serum vitamin D is an independent risk factor for developing acute myocardial infarction.

ST resolution (STR) is a predictor of reperfusion success. Our aim was to assess the prognostic impact of Q waves on presentation and STR after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The combined end point was of mortality and adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; death, repeat myocardial infarction, or heart failure). Q waves on presentation (Q wave, n = 332; no Q wave, n = 337) was associated with significantly less mean STR, greater incidence of akinetic, dyskinetic, or aneurysmal regional wall motion, lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and worse in-hospital and 1-year MACEs (1 year 24% vs 8.2%, p <0.001). In addition, Q waves on presentation compared to no Q waves were associated with worse 1-year MACE regardless of infarct presentation in < or =3 hours, infarct location, and adequate STR (> or =70%). Q waves on presentation and inadequate STR (<70%), but not symptom duration, were independent predictors of MACE by multivariable analysis (adjusted hazard ratios of 2.7 and 2.4 for Q waves and STR, respectively). Compared to group A (no Q waves on presentation with STR), patients in group B (no Q waves with inadequate STR), group C (Q waves with STR), and group D (Q waves with inadequate STR) had hazard ratios of 3.0, 3.6, and 7.7, respectively (p <0.05) for the occurrence of MACE.

Using an epidemiologic technique called the case-crossover method, the Myocardial Infarction Onset Study (MIOS) has provided quantitative data on sexual activity as a trigger of MI onset. Sexual activity was found to double the relative risk of acute MI in healthy individuals and patients with a prior history of angina or MI. However, the absolute risk of sexually triggered MI remains extremely low, because the baseline risk of MI is low for most individuals and the increased risk due to sexual activity is transient. Regular exercise also was found to reduce the risk of MI by sexual activity. Given that >12 million people in the United States have coronary artery disease, these findings should be more widely disseminated to reassure patients that, in most cases, sexual activity carries little risk of causing a cardiac event. In the future, advances in research on the triggering of MI are likely to yield new approaches to the prevention of cardiovascular events through prospective identification of the vulnerable plaques that lead to coronary thrombosis, and prophylactic measures to sever the link between triggers and their potentially disastrous consequences.",,J E Muller

Since 2010, myocardial infarction (MI) patients reported to the Swedish registry for MI (SWEDEHEART) are routinely classified into MI subtypes. The registry has been used to study the type 2 MI population but the MI-classification in the registry has not previously been validated. The aim of this study was to validate the type 2 MI classification in the registry. Design. A total of 772 patients diagnosed with MI in 2011 and reported to the SWEDEHEART registry were included in the study. All patients were retrospectively classified into MI type 1-5 or myocardial injury by independent reviewers strictly adhering to The Third Universal Definition of MI. This gold standard classification was compared with the classification in the registry. Results. Forty-eight (6.2%) patients were classified as type 2 MI in the registry compared with 93 (12.0%) according to the gold standard classification. A type 2 MI diagnosis was confirmed in 30 out of the 48 type 2 MI patients in the registry (PPV: 62.5%). There was a moderate rate of agreement (κ: 0.43) between the gold standard classification and the classification in SWEDEHEART in deciding a type 2 MI diagnosis. Conclusion. The SWEDEHEART registry agreed moderately with the gold standard in classifying patients with type 2 MI diagnosis. Thus, studies on patients with type 2 MI in the registry should be interpreted with caution. Since the prevalence of type 2 MI is substantially underestimated in SWEDEHEART, the registry should not be used to study the prevalence of type 2 MI.",Myocardial infarction; SWEDEHEART; type 2 myocardial infarction; universal definition of myocardial infarction; validation.,Anton Gard;Bertil Lindahl;Gorav Batra;Marcus Hjort;Karolina Szummer;Tomasz Baron

The investigators describe a case of posterior myocardial infarction where additional posterior leads were placed in the left paraspinal line, right paraspinal line, and right midscapular line, displaying more prominent current of injury than seen with traditional posterior lead placement. This may lead to a more robust identification of posterior myocardial infarction that, in turn, may allow for adequate treatment and triage.",,Smit C Vasaiwala;Ronald Schreiber

The VCGs (Frank system) of 70 patients with old inferior myocardial infarction were analyzed. The most important parameters previously considered by others and the behaviour of the different vectorial groups were considered. The results of the analysis of these parameters were concordant with those obtained by others. The morphologic evaluation of the QRS on different planes allowed our cases to be divided into five vectorcardiographic groups. The evaluation of the morphological aspects of the QRS for a more sure diagnosis of myocardial infarction, specially considering false positive cases, was considered from the semeiological point of view. Moreover, it was shown that some alterations of VCG cannot be apparent electrocardiographically. The electrogenetic meaning of vectorcardiographic alterations, probably related with depth and width of necrosis and with conduction disturbances in the subdivisions of left bundle branch, were evaluated.",,E Piccolo;L Artusi;A Castellani;P Pascotto;A Raviele
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2448899/,The therapy of acute myocardial infarction: current state of the art,"For decades management of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) consisted of bed rest, oxygen, prevention for thromboembolic complications, and treatment of arrhythmias and heart failure. In the last years a more aggressive treatment of AMI has been developed, based on the following three basic principles: (1) Mortality of patients with AMI is determined by the infarct size and the degree of left ventricular dysfunction. (2) The time interval between the onset of coronary occlusion and any intervention to limit infarct size is brief and takes usually not more than three to four hours. (3) After the acute phase of infarction a lot of patients remain at high risk of fatal coronary events, i.e. reinfarctions. The angiographic findings during the first hours of AMI showed in about 80% of patients an obstructive coronary thrombus and led to efforts to dissolve the offending thrombi. The demonstration that coronary thrombi can be lysed in about 80% of cases within 60 minutes after the intracoronary injection of thrombolytic agents (streptokinase or urokinase) has boosted the reperfusion therapy in AMI in the hope that ischemic myocardium might be salvaged. Intracoronary infusion of thrombolytic agents however, can be applied only in a minority of patients with AMI because coronary angiography and a skilled team of investigators are required, therefore a short-time intravenous high dose streptokinase infusion was developed. In the meantime two large double blind randomized trials (ISAM and GISSI) could demonstrate a reduction in hospital mortality in AMI especially by early treatment with intravenous streptokinase. Conventional thrombolytic agents produce a systemic lytic state with the possibility of hemorrhage, therefore recombinant tissuetype plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and two other drugs, acylated streptokinase and pro-urokinase, were developed with the aim of inducing coronary thrombolysis without severe systemic lytic state, but the efficacy of these new drugs remains to be demonstrated in randomized trials versus conventional thrombolytic agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,U Tebbe
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15216756/,[Assessment of postinfarction patients with nuclear techniques],"Residual myocardial ischemia and left ventricular systolic dysfunction are the major determinants of a patient's prognosis after myocardial infarction. Therefore, left ventricular function and residual ischemia should be evaluated in all patients before release. Coronary angiography should be performed in uncomplicated myocardial infarction patients with significant ischemia or left ventricular dysfunction. In these cases angiography must be performed to determine if coronary arteries are suitable for revascularization before performing a test of myocardial viability. Several radionuclide approaches are currently available for the clinical evaluation of patients after myocardial infarction. There is growing and consistent evidence that the scintigraphic approaches are the most sensitive technique to investigate the presence of ischemia or tissue viability and also to provide an accurate and reproducible evaluation of the left ventricular function. Most importantly, radionuclide evaluation in these patients provide valuable prognostic information. However, the number of patients with malignant arrhythmia's detected with routine evaluation is lower at this time. In several reports neuroadrenergic imaging evaluation with I-123-MIBG was predictive of sudden death. In consequence, it has been proposed that cardiac SPECT images with I-123-MIBG may provide important prognostic information in patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction. Therefore it is not surprising that the incorporation of new radionuclide techniques may improve the evaluation of patients after myocardial infarction.",,Enrique Vallejo

This method was introduced in our hospital in 2000. From January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2004, a total of 2,393 consecutive patients with STEMI were admitted (27% transferred from 9 non-PCI hospitals and 31 prehospital emergency units/outpatient clinics). Of these patients, 1,666 (70%) underwent urgent coronary angiography and primary PCI. Platelet glycoprotein llb/llla inhibitors were used in 40% and stent placement, in 78%. Postprocedural Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 3 flow was documented in 86%. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation was used in 6%; mechanical ventilation, in 8.6%; and inotropic drugs/vasopressors, in 15.8%. Mortality rates in patients with Killip's class I or II ranged from 1% to 4.9% without negative influence of ischemic time. In patients with Killip's class III or IV, mortality rates increased from 18% to 54% with increasing ischemic delay up to 6 hours (p = 0.06) and remained at around 40% afterward. Independent predictors of mortality were age (odds ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.64, p = 0.04), resuscitated cardiac arrest (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.18 to 5.05, p = 0.02), and postprocedural TIMI flow (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.59). Overall mortality rates of patients who underwent a primary PCI strategy from 2000 to 2004 were significantly lower than in the control group of 152 consecutive patients who underwent thrombolysis from 1995 to 1996 (6.2% vs 16.4%; p <0.001). In conclusion, introduction of a primary PCI strategy significantly decreased hospital mortality in our unselected group of patients with STEMI compared with the thrombolytic era.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10328618/,Clinical relevance of prodromal angina before acute myocardial infarction,"The term preconditioning was applied to the observation made in 1986 by Murry and colleagues that canine myocardium subjected to brief episodes of ischemia and reperfusion would tolerate a more prolonged episode of ischemia better than myocardium not previously exposed to ischemia. Since that seminal observation, protective effect of preconditioning was demonstrated in all animal species tested, resulting in the strongest form of in vivo protection against myocardial injury other than early reperfusion. Angina heralding acute myocardial infarction may represent the clinical correlate of preconditioning phenomenon in humans. Data from small pathophysiological studies demonstrated that prodromal angina (<48 hours prior to index myocardial infarction) causes a reduction of infarct size and consequently a better left ventricular function compared with patients without such clinical feature before myocardial infarction. The protective effect of prodromal angina was also confirmed in larger prospective studies; its presence translates into a significant reduction of a combination of death, cardiogenic shock and pulmonary edema during hospital stay. The exact mechanism of such clinical phenomenon is however not known, but it may include preconditioning. Other mechanisms have been also claimed to play an important role, like a more rapid lysis of the occlusive thrombus within the infarct-related artery, or a rapid opening of intramural collateral not visible at angiography. Whatever the mechanism, it appears that patients with prodromal angina before myocardial infarction exhibit, when rapidly reperfused, a better post-infarction clinical outcome. At the present ""optimal preconditioning-mimetic agents"" are yet to be found, and ""putting preconditioning in a bottle"" still remains a pharmacologic challenge.",,F Ottani;M Galvani;D Ferrini;F A Nicolini

Criteria have been proposed and ongoing studies are helping to establish guidelines to determine which survivors of an uncomplicated myocardial infarction can benefit from a knowledge of the coronary anatomy and ventricular function. In the case presented in this vignette the problem is related to angina recurring during the early stages of an acute myocardial infarction. Postinfarction angina often reflects subtotal obstruction of a major coronary artery that supplies either a portion of the myocardium that had infarcted or myocardium distant from the zone of the infarction.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3501331/,"Perioperative myocardial infarction with coronary artery surgery: diagnosis, incidence and consequences","Perioperative myocardial infarction is a potential consequence of coronary artery bypass surgery. The diagnosis is difficult due to multiple factors including postoperative chest discomfort, serum enzyme elevations and nonspecific electrocardiographic changes. No one test is reliable, but a combination of electrocardiogram, MBCK serum enzyme analysis and technetium pyrophosphate scanning should increase the probability of correct diagnosis. Using this method, the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction in this study was six out of 100. Left ventricular function in the early postoperative period was adversely affected by perioperative myocardial infarction with a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (63 +/- 9% preoperative to 54 +/- 12% postoperative; P less than 0.05), whereas left ventricular ejection fraction was unchanged in the absence of perioperative myocardial infarction. The long term left ventricular function, however, appears to recover, and at two years after surgery there was no difference in rest or exercise left ventricular function between patients who suffered perioperative myocardial infarction versus those who did not. All patients with perioperative myocardial infarction survived to be discharged from hospital, and all returned for follow-up at two years. Their functional and work status was no different from those without perioperative myocardial infarction. This would suggest that, if patients survive a perioperative myocardial infarction, their long term functional status is no different from those patients without perioperative myocardial infarction.",,M J Gardner;D E Johnstone;L Lalonde;R MacKenzie;C Cousins;D Murphy;B M Chandler

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6334199/,Timing of coronary revascularization after acute myocardial infarction. Early and late results in patients revascularized within seven weeks,"Evidence of ischemia after acute myocardial infarction is a serious complication. If angiography reveals significant coronary artery disease, the precise timing of myocardial revascularization may be of critical importance. From 1978 through 1982, 174 patients underwent myocardial revascularization within 7 weeks of a documented myocardial infarction. The male:female ratio was 138:36, the average age was 58 +/- 1 (SEM) years; and the ejection fractions averaged 41% +/- 1%. Forty-four (25%) patients required preoperative intra-aortic balloon pump support, and an additional 18 (10%) required intra-aortic balloon pumping to be separated from cardiopulmonary bypass. An average of 2.9 +/- 0.1 vessels per patient were bypassed. The hospital mortality for these 174 patients was 16%. When mortalities were categorized according to the postinfarction week in which operation was performed, hospital mortality fell from 46% for those patients operated upon within 1 week of infarction to 6% for those patients operated upon 7 weeks after infarction. Of those patients operated upon within the first week after infarction, 23% were in cardiogenic shock and 62% required preoperative balloon pumping. Clearly the most critically ill patients were operated upon during the early postinfarction period. However, there was a marked difference in survival when patients in each of the seven weekly groups were classified according to ejection fraction. All patients with an ejection fraction greater than or equal to 50% (50 patients) operated upon at any time after infarction survived their hospital course, with only one late death. Conversely, among the 124 patients with an ejection fraction less than 50% operated upon during this 7 week interval, there were 27 (22%) hospital deaths. In this latter group, survival rates steadily improved if revascularization was performed at a time more remote from the infarction. The difference in early and late survival rates of patients operated upon with an ejection fraction greater than or equal to 50% compared to patients with an ejection fraction less than 50% is highly significant (p less than 0.001). We conclude that myocardial revascularization is safe at any time after myocardial infarction for those individuals with an ejection fraction greater than or equal to 50%. However, if the ejection fraction is less than 50%, then operation after myocardial infarction should be delayed at least 4 weeks.",,M S Hochberg;V Parsonnet;I Gielchinsky;S M Hussain;D A Fisch;J C Norman

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2674435/,The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on coronary blood flow and infarct size limitation,"A number of theoretical and practical aspects of acute myocardial infarction suggest a potential role for ACE inhibition in enhancing coronary blood flow and limitation of infarct size. Indeed, the use of ACE inhibitors in acute myocardial infarction could be viewed as a logical intervention in the face of the neuroendocrine response which accompanies the acute phase. During the first 24 h post-infarction, very high plasma concentrations of arginine-vasopressin and catecholamines occur. This is followed by a sharp rise in the concentration of angiotensin II (ANG II) over the next few days. The neuroendocrine response is most marked in those patients with larger infarcts, who frequently develop left ventricular failure. The extent to which these factors influence coronary flow in acute myocardial infarction is unknown, although in chronic heart failure ACE inhibition does not reduce coronary blood flow despite a reduction in rate-pressure product, suggesting a coronary vasodilator effect. However, in the presence of fixed coronary stenoses, the fall in blood pressure and, therefore, of coronary perfusion pressure must be taken into account. Whether or not the use of ACE inhibitors can limit infarct size in man also remains to be determined, although it has been clearly demonstrated that concentrations of ANG II similar to those observed in the early phase of myocardial infarction can cause myocardial cell damage in experimental animals. Post-infarction ventricular enlargement can be reduced by ACE inhibitors. Additionally, ACE inhibitors, through their balanced vasodilator effect, maintain cardiac output whilst reducing filling pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,H J Dargie;S G Ray

Myocardial bridging occurred only in the acute phase of inferior MI and not in the chronic phase. In the acute phase of inferior MI, compensatory hypercontraction of the anterior wall is assumed to occur in response to the decrease in the movement of the infarct-related walls. In the chronic phase, disappearance of the myocardial bridging observed due to the resolution of compensatory anterior wall hypercontraction, as a result of the reperfusion of infarct-related coronary artery. Most of the myocardial bridges seen in autopsy series are not seen angiographically. Variation at angiography may in part be attributable to small and thin bridges causing little compression. Adrenergic stimulation or afterload reduction by nitroglycerin facilitates diagnosis of myocardial bridging by increasing coronary compression.

Deficiencies in the Killip index included absence of crucial clinical features with prognostic power (e.g., age, systolic blood pressure, infarct location), while the Norris index was deficient in its requirement for a chest radiograph to estimate the presence of pulmonary edema and of cardiac enlargement.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8328677/,The clinical outcome of acute myocardial infarction is related to the circadian rhythm of myocardial infarction onset,"In order to study whether the circadian rhythm of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) onset has any impact on the clinical outcome, in terms of enzymatically estimated infarct size, circulatory arrest from ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and in-hospital mortality, the authors studied a representative population of 10,791 AMIs treated in the same center between 1973 and 1987. In 6,763 cases (63%) the time of symptom onset was known. In these cases a major peak in AMI incidence was observed between 7:01 AM and 10:00 AM, and minor peaks at 12:01 noon, 3:01 PM-4:00 PM, and 8:01 PM-9:00 PM. In a set of multivariate analyses including several clinical characteristics, symptom onset between 6:00 AM and 12:00 noon significantly predicted a greater infarct size, and symptom onset between 12:00 AM and 6:00 AM was associated with a significantly lower risk of circulatory arrests from ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The time of symptom onset was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality after adjustment for other clinical characteristics, including infarct size.

Sixty-five patients presenting with their first inferior myocardial infarction and predominant right ventricular involvement were consecutively treated as follows: group A (20 patients) conservatively (without thrombolytic therapy), group B (19 patients) with streptokinase and group C (26 patients) with recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator. Coronary angiography was performed within 72 h after admission in 52 patients (10 of group A, 18 of group B and in 24 patients of group C) followed by transluminal coronary angioplasty in 26. All groups had similar characteristics except for a higher mean age in group A. Within 3 months, a remarkable improvement in right ventricular function and a major increase in ejection fraction was observed for all three patient groups. Improvement of right ventricular function was more prominent in patients with residual flow through the infarct-related artery. The beneficial course was comparable in all the groups, unaffected by the type of medical treatment applied, or by the performance of coronary angioplasty. No further significant change occurred beyond this period. Thus, early thrombolytic therapy does not augment the generally favorable course of recovery of the right ventricle from acute infarction.",,A Roth;H I Miller;E Kaluski;G Keren;B Shargorodsky;R Krakover;G I Barbash;S Laniado
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9767824/,[Specifically adapted management of diabetics after myocardial infarct],"Approximately 20% of all patients hospitalized for myocardial infarction have diabetes. The percentage has been increasing constantly and mortality is significantly higher in these patients. The highest rate is observed in women. Despite continuing progress in patient management there has been no reduction in the overmortality after myocardial infarction in diabetic patients. The majority of these deaths are unwarranted and could be avoided if diabetic patients were given specifically adapted treatment after myocardial infarction. Unfortunately, as shown by the EURASPIRE study, there is a gap between intensive care unit discharge prescriptions and follow-up care. With the explosive ""epidemic"" of noninsulin-diabetes and population aging the number of patients with coronary artery disease and diabetes will rise in the future. Wouldn't it be reasonable to establish special cardiodiabetic units where such patients could benefit from close, and daily, cooperation between diabetologists and cardiologists?

However, a sizable portion of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction have concomitant multivessel disease, which raises important therapeutic and prognostic issues. Indeed, it is still unclear whether percutaneous coronary intervention of the culprit vessel alone is superior, equivalent, or inferior in terms of risk-benefit balance in comparison to a strategy of complete revascularization, with percutaneous coronary intervention of nonculprit vessels as well. The present systematic review provides an updated prospective on the rationale, background, and outcomes of culprit-only versus multivessel percutaneous revascularization in subjects undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Our findings clearly demonstrate that multivessel coronary disease significantly and adversely impacts on patient prognosis, yet a culprit-only revascularization strategy should be sought after in most cases, unless patient instability or symptoms/signs of residual myocardial ischemia support nonculprit vessel intervention.",,Giuseppe Biondi-Zoccai;Marzia Lotrionte;Imad Sheiban

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20799840/,"Polarization birefringence measurements for characterizing the myocardium, including healthy, infarcted, and stem-cell-regenerated tissues","Myocardial infarction leads to structural remodeling of the myocardium, in particular to the loss of cardiomyocytes due to necrosis and an increase in collagen with scar formation. Stem cell regenerative treatments have been shown to alter this remodeling process, resulting in improved cardiac function. As healthy myocardial tissue is highly fibrous and anisotropic, it exhibits optical linear birefringence due to the different refractive indices parallel and perpendicular to the fibers. Accordingly, changes in myocardial structure associated with infarction and treatment-induced remodeling will alter the anisotropy exhibited by the tissue. Polarization-based linear birefringence is measured on the myocardium of adult rat hearts after myocardial infarction and compared with hearts that had received mesenchymal stem cell treatment. Both point measurement and imaging data show a decrease in birefringence in the region of infarction, with a partial rebound back toward the healthy values following regenerative treatment with stem cells. These results demonstrate the ability of optical polarimetry to characterize the micro-organizational state of the myocardium via its measured anisotropy, and the potential of this approach for monitoring regenerative treatments of myocardial infarction.",,Michael F G Wood;Nirmalya Ghosh;Marika A Wallenburg;Shu-Hong Li;Richard D Weisel;Brian C Wilson;Ren-Ke Li;I Alex Vitkin

In view of paucity of literature from different centres from India on this issue, the present study was undertaken to determine the in-hospital mortality with acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction presenting to a tertiary care cardiac centre in India. Consecutive patients (n=862) with the diagnosis of acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction admitted in Heart Hospital, Patna between June 2003 and July 2006 were included in this study. The in-hospital mortality and event rates (reinfarction, recurrent angina and heart failure) were analysed. The mean age of study population was 56 +/- 13 years. There were 690 males (80.05%) and 172 females (19.95%); 468 patients (54.29%) had hypertension, 384 patients (44.55%) were diabetic, 415 (48.14%) were smokers/tobacco chewers and 154 patients (17.86%) had past history of myocardial infarction. Anterior wall infarction was present in 435 patients (50.46%), 408 patients (47.33%) had inferior wall infarction, 115 patients (13.34%) had associated right ventricular or posterior wall infarction and 19 (2.20%) had antero-inferior infarction; 346 patients (40.14%) received thrombolytic therapy while the other patients were not thrombolysed due to various reasons (usually late arrival).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1723125/,New approaches to risk stratification after myocardial infarction,"Parameters to assess the presence of electrical instability after myocardial infarction include spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias, late potentials, and programmed ventricular stimulation. The accuracy of the long-term electrocardiogram in correctly identifying high-risk patients has been questioned because spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias also occur in a large proportion of patients who do not develop ventricular tachycardia or sudden death during follow-up (false-positive results). In addition, many patients died suddenly without having these markers. Late potentials, although showing a good correlation to subsequent occurrence of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia or sudden death, are also burdened by the problem of a great number of false-positive results. Programmed ventricular stimulation (such as late potentials) assesses the presence of an arrhythmogenic substrate. An abnormal finding such as inducibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmia is predictive of subsequent occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Combining these approaches, additionally including a low ejection fraction, subgroups of patients at very high risk of sudden death or sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia can be identified. Noninvasive procedures (such as Holter monitoring or recording of late potentials) are desirable for screening purposes, whereas it would be acceptable to use more aggressive invasive techniques in certain subsets of patients. A step-like approach using noninvasive recording of late ventricular potentials as the initial step would allow the preselection of patients for further evaluation by invasive electrophysiological techniques.",,G Breithardt;M Borggrefe;T Fetsch;T Budde

The locus of maximal ST elevation was stable for at least two days in 86% of 27 patients with anterior infarction. A single maximum or maximum-minimum was found in 88% but 22% of the patients had multiple maxima and/or minima in at least two maps. Areas of significant ST elevation were often excluded from the precordial matrix. The site of maximal ST elevation correlated with scintigraphic infarct site but was displaced medially in lateral infarction. The relation between infarct size and sigmaST elevation was significant and curvilinear. sigmaST underestimated size in large anterior infarction. The correlation of the size and the number of sites with ST elevation greater than or equal to 1.5 mm was weak (r = 0.56). The degree of ST abnormality in 14 patients with inferior infarction decreased significantly during the initial 24 hours.

An essential decision-making aid in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction,"Automated data processing is playing an increasing role in evaluations of left ventricular function, infarct size, and ventricular dysrhythmia in patients with acute myocardial infarction. For example, radionuclide angiocardiography permits accurate, serial non-invasive assessments of ejection fraction and detection of ventricular wall motion abnormalities; estimation of infarct size from observed and projected plasma CPK changes facilitates evaluation of interventions designed to reduce ischemic injury; positron emission transaxial tomography (PETT) appears to offer prompt, objective, non-invasive determination of the extent of jeopardized myocardium; and automated analysis of rhythm characterizes relationships between infarction and ventricular dysrhythmia. These and related techniques are useful not only in patient management, but also as research tools. Thus, factors potentially responsible for early and late ventricular dysrhythmias may be delineated by objective characterization of large numbers of ectopic depolarizations; the mechanisms underlying early (malignant) and late ventricular dysrhythmias may be differentiated and clarified. These and other applications of automated data processing techniques should facilitate objective evaluation and development of more effective therapy and prove increasingly useful in the management of patients with acute myocardial infarction.",,P B Corr;B E Sobel

Observations of temporal and spatial evolution over 24 hours,"Myocardial infarction was induced in 7 mongrel dogs by transfemoral intraluminal occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Perfusion area at risk was determined by post-mortem coronarography and infarct size by macrohistological staining with para-nitrophenoltetrazolium. Regional flow was determined by injection of radioactive microspheres 0.2 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours post occlusion. Infarct size as determined by planimetry of post-mortem angiograms and macrohistological stains at identical magnification revealed 74.5 +/- 12.1% infarcted tissue of the perfusion area at risk. The flow of the necrotic tissue was below 13 Ml/100 g min without exception, indicating a threshold perfusion for maintenance of myocardial viability. Accordingly, a flow of less than or equal to 10 ml/100 g min identified 93% of the entire infarcted myocardium, resulting in 71 +/0 20% as compared to the perfusion area at risk. Based on the good agreement of macrohistological and flow data, the evolution of myocardial injury was determined by flow measurements. The results indicated a different progression of the borders of critical flow in the subendocardial and subepicardial layers, whereas in the subendocardium 85% of the tissue at risk was identified by the critical flow at 0.2 hours and 97% at 12 hours, the subepicardial flow changed at a different pace: only 53% showed subcritical perfusion at 0.2 hours, 61% at 12 hours with a final increase of 39% from 12 to 24 hours.",,M Gottwik;P Zimmer;B Wüsten;M Hofmann;B Winkler;W Schaper

All epidemiologic studies examining prognosis after acute myocardial infarction have used data collected in the midst of the epidemic, possibly giving rise to conflicting results. Hospitalization rates for myocardial infarction have remained relatively stable for the past five decades, in the face of declining coronary heart disease risk factor prevalence and mortality rates, yielding to a paradoxical effect. Many factors like the decrease in severity of such disease and the changes in myocardial infarction definitions may have contributed to such phenomenon. Moreover, because non-ST elevation myocardial infarctions now constitute most of cases in communities, interventions must be designed that recognize this epidemiological reality. At the same time, improved survival in recent decades may have contributed to an increase in the pool of people at risk for developing HF. Thus, the epidemiology and treatment of this condition has not stood still.",,Leonardo Bolognese

Despite the good results reported by several investigators none of the prospective randomized trials comparing thrombolytic therapy with angioplasty (either alone or associated to thrombolysis) has shown any improvement in survival, the latter strategy being associated with an excess of acute complications. However, primary angioplasty may be useful in selected subgroups such as those with cardiogenic shock or with absolute contraindications for thrombolysis.

Acute viral (and other) infection in the onset, pathogenesis, and mimicry of acute myocardial infarction","Because a prospective controlled investigation showed a highly significant association of the onset of acute myocardial infarction with signs of preceding respiratory infection, the clinical, laboratory, experimental, and epidemiologic evidence more directly supporting this association was analyzed. Inflammation--specifically of infectious, usually viral, origin--has been shown by several lines of evidence to be capable of precipitating or mimicking clinical myocardial infarction. Myocardial biopsy is producing rapidly increasing confirmation that myocarditis can perfectly mimic clinical acute myocardial infarction. Coronary arteritis, with implications for vasospasm and thrombosis, is being increasingly demonstrated when deliberately sought in necropsy and biopsy material. Effects of blood-borne infectious agents, particularly viremia, on platelets in vivo and in vitro--aggregation and lysis with release of vasoactive substances--have even more serious potential for coronary thrombosis and vasospasm. It is not clear whether such mechanisms operate entirely independently or are more potent in high-risk patients, particularly in view of the demonstrable hypercoagulable state in many patients with coronary disease. Because of the great importance of confirming precipitating mechanisms for acute myocardial infarction (as well as its frequent mimic, myocarditis), intensive investigation of the relation between infection and infarction has important preventive and therapeutic implications.",,D H Spodick

Recently, considerable attention has shifted away from the epicardial arteries to the microvasculature. Contemporary evidence suggests that epicardial patency does not necessarily translate to actual perfusion at the myocardial level.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22959995/,Can we assess an acute myocardial infarction in patients with acute coronary syndrome according to diagnostic accuracy of heat shock proteins?,"Heat shock proteins (HSPs) have changed very little with evolution, suggesting that they play important role(s) in cellular survival. Specifically, HSPs protect cells from induced cell death. Their expression is triggered by heat or other stress, such as ischemia. HSPs provide protection against protein denaturation, although they slightly differ with respect to group affiliation. Release of HSPs from necrotic and ischemic cardiomyocytes into the intercellular space and plasma may correlate with the intensity of the pro-inflammatory response observed during and immediately after myocardial infarction. We hypothesized that the plasma concentration of particularly inducible forms of HSPs from different groups (HSP 90, HSP 70, HSP 60 and/or HSP 20) can be used as early specific markers for diagnosing myocardial infarction in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Our hypothesis is supported by the following data: (I) HSP expression occurs very early after acute coronary events; (II) HSP concentrations increase rapidly in the peripheral blood; (III) HSP concentrations correlate with markers of myocardial necrosis and pro-inflammatory biochemical parameters. The magnitude of the increase in plasma HSP concentrations over initial concentrations during the period of highest sensitivity and specificity of the assay could be important for early detection of myocardial infarction and distinguishing it from unstable angina. We suggest that these parameters, along with close observation of patients with chest pain, will assist providers who must differentiate between acute myocardial damage and other organ diseases.",,G Laskarin;V Persic;R Miškulin;A Ruzic;L Zaputovic

Especially in severely injured patients the optimal therapy of the myocardial infarction is not well established, since anticoagulants, platelet aggregation inhibitors or thrombolytics are frequently contraindicated under these conditions. We report a case of a 41-year-old man, who presented with an acute myocardial infarction in combination with a severe polytrauma (multiple rib fractures, hematothorax, pelvic bone fractures, multiple injuries of intestinal organs) after a motorcycle accident with a blunt chest and abdominal trauma. After surgical treatment of the injuries of the bones and the intestinal organs a coronary angiography was immediately performed. The left anterior descending and the circumflex coronary artery were occluded in the mid-portion of the vessels. Coronary recanalization by PTCA and the implantation of coronary stents were successful in both vessels. Despite of a non-optimal blood flow after recanalization and stenting in one vessel (LAD TIMI II flow after recanalization), and a non-optimal accompanying medical therapy, during and after intervention (intravenous heparin starting 8 hours after the coronary intervention and platelet inhibitors starting 4 days after the intervention) the coronary angiogram after 2 months documented both vessels patent without a reocclusion or a restenosis. The case report documents, that in traumatic myocardial infarctions the treating of both, the attending injuries and the myocardial ischemia, is feasible.

Contractile function was studied 8-9 weeks after operation, with an isoprenaline dose response protocol, in a retrograde Langendorff perfusion. Also, plasma noradrenaline concentration, infarct size and morphology were determined. Compared with controls, myocardial infarction/aortic banding animals showed a decreased contractile function, both at baseline and after maximal isoprenaline stimulation, and elevated noradrenaline levels (1316 +/- 94) vs 1909 +/- 174 pg/ml, both p < 0.05). In myocardial infarction rats, baseline values, but not those after inotropic stimulation were decreased, when compared with controls, while the calculated Emax was significantly decreased. In aortic banding rats, contractile parameters were not significantly impaired, compared with controls. Both myocardial infarction and the myocardial infarction/aortic banding animals, but not aortic banding rats, had a significantly increased heart weight (1.4 +/- 0.04 g for controls vs 1.7 +/- 0.08 g for myocardial infarction and 2.0 +/- 0.12 g for myocardial infarction/aortic banding), and left ventricular cavity volume (19 +/- 1.4 mm3 for controls vs 49 +/- 5.5 mm3 for myocardial infarction and 48 +/- 4.3 mm3 for myocardial infarction/aortic banding) compared to control animals. Infarct size was 36.0% and 39.4% for the myocardial infarction and myocardial infarction/aortic banding animals, respectively.

These data document two important facts. First, the effects of timolol in the total sample were also seen in different subpopulations, and there were no major subgroups for which this positive effect would not be expected. Second, the consistency of the effects observed with respect to pulse, transmural infarction, age and infarct site are in contrast to some previous studies with practolol, propranolol, and alprenolol.

Prognostic implications,"Atrial fibrillation was observed in 39 (11 percent) of 350 instances of acute myocardial infarction. The mortality among these patients was 41 percent (16/39). Atrial fibrillation was more common in patients with undetermined infarctions and in older people. As opposed to death rates close to 50 percent among patients with anterior, combined, and undetermined infarctions, the presence of atrial fibrillation did not affect the mortality among patients with inferior infarctions (10 percent, 1/10). Ventricular rates higher than 120 beats per minute and duration of the arrhythmia longer than six hours were not associated with increased mortality. Hemodynamic failure was present in almost all of the cases and preceded the arrhythmia in most of them. It is concluded that different mechanisms are responsible for the production of atrial fibrillation in the setting of acute myocardial infarction, and the prognosis of the patient is related to the mechanism of production and not to the arrhythmia itself.",,N Cristal;I Peterburg;J Szwarcberg

IMR finds an interesting application in the study of different stages of myocardial infarction. In 30 cases of myocardial infarction IMR was compared with thallium tomoscintigraphy and echocardiography. In the acute stage, myomalacia appears in IMR as a superbrilliant zone, and in the chronic stage parietal thinning and dyskinesias are apparent. Intraventricular thromboses, but also hemostasis in aneurysmatic or akinetic sites are visualised as a high-intensity signal within these areas. IMR represents therefore a new means of evaluation of size and evolution of the necrosis.

Female patients account for approximately one third of all cases of AMI in Germany. Despite the high incidence and prevalence, women after myocardial infarction remained seriously neglected for decades in epidemiological and clinical studies. In this review gender-specific aspects of health care delivery and cardiac rehabilitation after an AMI are summarized. Gender-specific targets and recommendations in current guidelines and different needs for medical and psychosocial interventions as well as the current practice of health care delivery will be discussed. Empirical data suggest that health care for female patients after AMI does not follow existing guidelines as strictly as the health care for male patients; the reasons are widely unknown. There is a tremendous need for further research on gender-specific differences in health care needs and in the effectiveness of health care interventions in male and female cardiac patients. Systematic knowledge is an essential precondition for the development of gender specific guidelines for the health care and rehabilitation of patients after AMI.",,G Grande

A randomized controlled study,"To assess the benefit of immediate surgical reperfusion over conventional medical treatment during the first acute evolving transmural myocardial infarction, 68 patients presenting within 4 hours of onset of chest pain were randomized into a medical group and a surgical group. Both groups were comparable for age, sex, coronary risk factors, location of infarct, and coronary anatomy. Radionuclide global ejection fraction at 48 hours after admission was 45 +/- 15% for the medical group versus 50 +/- 15% for the surgical group; at 3 months, ejection fraction values were 51 +/- 13% and 51 +/- 13%, respectively (p = NS). The average radionuclide wall-motion scores (normal, 3) at 3 months were 2 +/- 0.6 for the medical group and 2 +/- 0.7 for the surgical group. There were three (8.8%) early and four (11.7%) late deaths in the medical group and only one (2.9%) early death in the surgical group.

A murmur suggestive of MR was present on admission in 76 patients (9%). Patients with MR on admission were older and more apt to be female and nonwhite. They also had a significantly greater frequency of prior infarction and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. There was no difference in the location (anterior or inferior) of infarction. Patients with MR on admission had a 36% mortality compared to 16% for those who developed MR later in the hospitalization and 15% for those without MR by auscultation (p less than 0.001). Correction for differences in baseline variables indicated that the presence of MR on admission did not contribute independently to mortality.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2405621/,New approaches to treatment of myocardial infarction,"Survival of patients with acute transmural infarction is largely related to the size of the myocardial infarction. The goal of thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction is maximal salvage of myocardium by reestablishment of flow in the occluded infarct-related artery and the establishment and maintenance of a patent infarct-related artery. Results of randomized trials show a significant reduction in mortality in patients who have undergone thrombolysis. A patent infarct-related artery, even in the absence of a change in left ventricular function, is associated with reduced mortality. The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Trial and the European Cooperative Trial showed that recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator is superior to streptokinase in reestablishing flow in a totally occluded artery. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that thrombolysis and thrombosis occur simultaneously, and that lysis appears to increase both thrombin and platelet activity. Effective reduction of thrombosis accelerates thrombolysis. Rethrombosis after thrombolysis is due to anchored residual thrombus, which alters the hemorrheology of blood flow and produces a highly thrombogenic substrate that is largely due to residual fibrin-bound thrombin. Platelet deposition is directly related to severity of residual stenosis and shear rate. Thrombin appears to be the most potent of the 5 potential stimulators of platelet activation during arterial thrombosis. Proper anticoagulation can play an important role in reducing thrombosis. Experimental evidence strongly supports the use of heparin during and after thrombolysis. A recently reported study shows continued reduction of residual stenosis after 1 month of vigorous anticoagulation with intravenous heparin and subsequent oral anticoagulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,J H Chesebro;L Badimon;V Fuster

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7634264/,[Elements conditioning the severity of myocardial infarction damage],"The severity of myocardial damage following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is essentially influenced by the duration of coronary flow interruption during the acute episode. Furthermore the duration and severity of ""culprit"" lesion before AMI, as well as the presence of adequate collaterals to the culprit vessel represent important factors able to influence the severity of myocardial dysfunction after AMI. Left ventricular damage might evolve progressively depending on the infarct size, the presence of diffuse and severe coronary artery disease and concomitant systemic disease, such as diabetes and systemic hypertension. From a therapeutic point of view, in the presence of irreversible myocardial damage (scar tissue) following AMI medical therapy must be addressed to reduce myocardial consumption and to prevent ventricular dilatation. However myocardial dysfunction following AMI might be reversible (hibernated myocardium). It is of remarkable value the recognition of the hibernated but viable tissue because restoration of normal blood flow, which is the gold standard therapy in these patients, improves myocardial function and clinical outcome in AMI patients. In the presence of hibernated tissue following AMI, pharmacological therapy might temporarily protect the hibernated areas; however, when restoration of normal blood flow (myocardial revascularization) is not performed early, myocardial dysfunction might worsen and progressively evolve becoming irreversible event with restoration of normal coronary flow.",,G Trevi;I Sheiban;R Gorni

Such tools must permit accurate measurement of the amount of myocardium that is initially at risk. 99mTc-sestamibi is a new radiopharmaceutical with unique properties that are well suited to the measurement of myocardium at risk without any delay in acute therapy. Tomographic imaging with this agent has been shown to provide accurate quantitative estimates of the myocardium at risk, which varies widely, even for patients with a similar coronary occlusion. For example, there is more than a threefold range in myocardium at risk for patients with a nonproximal occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The determination of the myocardium at risk before intervention and the change in this region after intervention constitute a promising measurement tool for the assessment of the effect of acute therapy. Initial studies with tomographic imaging have shown a significant improvement in a group of patients treated with thrombolysis, although the magnitude of improvement is highly variable in individual patients. Qualitatively similar results have been reported with planar imaging. Although it has a number of technical limitations, sequential imaging with 99mTc-sestamibi seems to have a clear advantage over those end points that have previously been used to assess acute therapy.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15992820/,Signaling factors in stem cell-mediated repair of infarcted myocardium,"Myocardial infarction leads to scar formation and subsequent reduced cardiac performance. The ultimate therapy after myocardial infarction would pursue stem cell-based regeneration. The aim of stem cell-mediated cardiac repair embodies restoration of cardiac function by regeneration of healthy myocardial tissue, which is accomplished by neo-angiogenesis and cardiogenesis. A major reservoir of adult autologous stem cells distal from the heart is the bone marrow. Adequate regulation of signaling between the bone marrow, the peripheral circulation and the infarcted myocardium is important in orchestrating the process of mobilization, homing, incorporation, survival, proliferation and differentiation of stem cells, that leads to myocardial regeneration. In this review, we discuss key signaling factors, including cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, which are involved in orchestrating the stem cell driven repair process. We focus on signaling factors known for their mobilizing and chemotactic abilities (SDF-1, G-CSF, SCF, IL-8, VEGF), signaling factors that are expressed after myocardial infarction involved in the patho-physiological healing process (TNF-alpha, IL-8, IL-10, HIF-1alpha, VEGF, G-CSF) and signaling factors that are involved in cardiogenesis and neo-angiogenesis (VEGF, EPO, TGF-beta, HGF, HIF-1alpha, IL-8).

We investigated the reproducibility of this reciprocal ST depression induced by stress testing and correlated the ECG changes with coronary angiographic evaluation of arteries supplying the remote area. We tried to derive criteria for detection of simple mirror image. 3 different groups were defined according to ECG evolution: Group 1 consisted of 7 anterior and 3 inferior AMI where reciprocal ECG changes disappeared appeared within 24 to 48 hours independently of the ECG changes in the infarcted area. These ST depressions were reproduced by stress testing one to two months later, and correlated angiographically with an anatomic lesion. 7 out of 10 patients later had bypass graft surgery. Group 2 consisted of 7 patients in whom posterior wall extension of an inferior AMI made the diagnosis of anterior ischemia impossible. In another two patients (one anterior and one inferior AMI) reciprocal ST depression and infarcted area ECG changes showed a simultaneous evolution. The reciprocal ST depression could not be reproduced during stress testing and did not correlate with any angiographic lesion. It is concluded that reciprocal ST depression during the acute phase of transmural anterior or purely inferior myocardial infarction is correlated with multivessel coronary disease if their regression is not strictly simultaneous to the infarction-related ECG changes.

On study entry the groups had similar distributions for variables such as mean age, gender, previous myocardial infarction, abnormal creatine kinase activity, area of infarction, number of vessels diseased and clinical classification. The hospital mortality rate of the medical versus surgical group was 11.5% (23 of 200) versus 5.8% (11 of 187) (p = 0.07). Early reperfusion (that is, less than or equal to 6 h) resulted in a lower mortality rate than did medical therapy--2% (2 of 100) versus 11.5% (23 of 200) (p less than 0.05)--whereas the hospital mortality rate with late reperfusion was 10.3% (9 of 87). The long-term mortality rate of the medical and surgical groups was 41% (82 of 200) versus 27% (51 of 187) (p = 0.0007) with use of an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model. In the survivors, the differences between medical and surgical groups in recurrent myocardial infarction, mortality associated with reinfarction and sudden death were prospectively followed and evaluated by the life table method. Recurrent myocardial infarction was not prevented by surgical reperfusion or medical therapy (23% in both groups), however, the mortality rate in patients with recurrent infarction was higher in the medical therapy group--36.6% (15 of 41) versus 17.5% (7 of 40) (p = 0.04). The mortality difference did not depend on early or late surgical reperfusion. In the in-hospital survivors, the incidence of sudden death was 17.5% in the medical (31 of 177) versus 7.4% (13 of 176) in the surgical group (p = 0.01). This difference was much more pronounced in the early reperfusion group. Functional class was significantly lower than that for medical therapy in the early reperfusion but not the late reperfusion group. Thus, in comparable groups given medical and surgical therapy for acute myocardial infarction and followed up for greater than or equal to 10 years, surgical reperfusion appears to offer improved longevity in selected cases (when implemented early) but does not prevent recurrent myocardial infarction. The associated mortality with recurrent myocardial infarction is less as is the incidence of sudden death. Finally, lower functional class occurs most often in patients given early reperfusion.",,M A DeWood;R N Notske;R Berg Jr;J H Ganji;C S Simpson;M L Hinnen;S L Selinger;L D Fisher

Myocardial blush grade (MBG) reflects myocardial response to ischemia/reperfusion injury, which may differ according to time of the day. The aim of our study was to explore the 24-hour variation in MBG and MI size in relation to outcomes in STEMI patients. A retrospective multicenter analysis of 6970 STEMI patients was performed. Time of onset of STEMI was divided into four 6-hour periods. STEMI patients have a significant 24-hour pattern in onset of symptoms, with peak onset around 09:00 hour. Ischemic time was longest and MI size, estimated by peak creatine kinase concentration, was largest in patients with STEMI onset between 00:00 and 06:00 hours. Both MBG and MI size were independently associated with mortality. Time of onset of STEMI was not independently associated with mortality when corrected for baseline and procedural factors. Interestingly, patients presenting with low MBG between 00:00 and 06:00 hours had a better prognosis compared to other groups. In conclusion, patients with symptom onset between 00:00 and 06:00 hours have longer ischemic time and consequently larger MI size. However, this does not translate into a higher mortality in this group. In addition, patients with failed reperfusion presenting in the early morning hours have better prognosis, suggesting a 24-hour pattern in myocardial protection.",24-hour variation; infarct size; myocardial infarction; myocardial perfusion; outcome.,Wouter G Wieringa;Chris P H Lexis;Karim D Mahmoud;Jan Paul Ottervanger;Johannes G M Burgerhof;Gabija Pundziute;Arnoud W J van 't Hof;Wiek H van Gilst;Erik Lipsic

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15135691/,Quantitative myocardial contrast echocardiography for prediction of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow in acute myocardial infarction,"Clinical evaluation of arterial patency in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is unreliable. We sought to identify infarction and predict infarct-related artery patency measured by the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score with qualitative and quantitative intravenous myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE). Thirty-four patients with suspected STEMI underwent MCE before emergency angiography and planned angioplasty. MCE was performed with harmonic imaging and variable triggering intervals during intravenous administration of Optison. Myocardial perfusion was quantified offline, fitting an exponential function to contrast intensity at various pulsing intervals. Plateau myocardial contrast intensity (A), rate of rise (beta), and myocardial flow (Q = A x beta) were assessed in 6 segments. Qualitative assessment of perfusion defects was sensitive for the diagnosis of infarction (sensitivity 93%) and did not differ between anterior and inferior infarctions. However, qualitative assessment had only moderate specificity (50%), and perfusion defects were unrelated to TIMI flow. In patients with STEMI, quantitatively derived myocardial blood flow Q (A x beta) was significantly lower in territories subtended by an artery with impaired (TIMI 0 to 2) flow than those territories supplied by a reperfused artery with TIMI 3 flow (10.2 +/- 9.1 vs 44.3 +/- 50.4, p = 0.03). Quantitative flow was also lower in segments with impaired flow in the subtending artery compared with ""normal"" patients with TIMI 3 flow (42.8 +/- 36.6, p = 0.006) and all segments with TIMI 3 flow (35.3 +/- 32.9, p = 0.018). An receiver-operator characteristic curve derived cut-off Q value of <11.3, representing impaired myocardial flow, was 73% sensitive and 67% specific for TIMI <3 flow at angiography. Thus, qualitative MCE identifies patients with STEMI but provides no information regarding infarct-related artery patency, whereas quantitative MCE can predict impaired flow in patients with acute STEMI.",,Stuart Moir;Brian Haluska;Dominic Leung;Richard Lim;Paul Garrahy;Thomas H Marwick

Myocardial infarction was atypical in 27.8.0% and typical in 72.0% of patients. Late diagnosis of typical and atypical MI was 13.4% and 21.2% respectively. No statistically significant differences were found in frequency of diagnostic errors in different demographic groups of patients. For the three years of this investigation, there was a trend to hyperdiagnosis of myocardial infarction, especially in young patients and males. Late diagnosis occurred more rarely in both males and females. During the investigation period, the reduction of hypo and rise in hyperdiagnosis occurred due to atypical variants.",,N G Tsintsadze

Its hallmark is a new systolic murmur associated with hemodynamic worsening. An echocardiogram is necessary for diagnosis. We report on two cases, both of which had a good outcome. Serial echocardiograms showed that enhanced contractility of the basal left ventricular segments obstructed cardiac ejection by means of mitral valve systolic anterior movement in the left ventricular outflow tract. In both cases, the intraventricular gradient remained for several days and subsequently disappeared.

Total coronary occlusion was observed in 110 of 126 patients (87 per cent) who were evaluated within four hours of the onset of symptoms; this proportion decreased significantly, to 37 of 57 (65 per cent), when patients were studied 12 to 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. Among 59 patients with angiographic features of coronary thrombosis, the thrombus was retrieved by Fogarty catheter in 52 (88 per cent) but was absent in seven (12 per cent false positive). Among an additional 20 patients without angiographic features of thrombosis, a thrombus was discovered in five (25 per cent false negative). Thus, total coronary occlusion is frequent during the early hours of transmural infarction and decreases in frequency during the initial 24 hours, suggesting that coronary spasm or thrombus formation with subsequent recanalization or both may be important in the evolution of infarction.",,M A DeWood;J Spores;R Notske;L T Mouser;R Burroughs;M S Golden;H T Lang

The higher prevalence of myocardial infarction in older women and those with other known risk factors suggests the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment is the same as for men. Differences in socioeconomic status, psychosocial profiles, presenting symptoms, disease progression, and a poorer response to treatment suggests that myocardial infarction in women is not fully understood. Women need to know they are at risk and not delay seeking treatment for subtle but important symptoms. Assessment strategies that take into account the woman's body, personal profile, and the female pattern of variant angina, non-Q wave, nonocclusive infarction are reviewed.

Detection and extent of a regional wall motion disorder in 2 DE were compared to ECG, enzymes, hemodynamics, coronary angiography and clinical data. The reliability of ECG and 2 DE in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was found to be similar: sensitivity 89% for 2 DE, 96% for ECG; specificity 89% vs (= versus) 73%; positive predictive value 95% vs 89%; negative predictive value 79% vs 90%. This means that in most cases the ECG is a sufficient and reliable method in detecting or excluding acute myocardial infarction. Because of the equipment needed, the limited practicability and because of specific problems (distinction between new and old infarction), the 2 DE should be regarded as a supporting method to the ECG but not as an essential one in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. The possible benefit of echocardiographic examination is the identification of high risk patients by non-invasive determination of the size of infarction.

There is a convincing evidence that secondary prevention reduces the risk of new ischemic events and mortality. Specifically, the modification of cardiovascular risk factors and the use of prophylactic treatments have shown that the risk of a further major ischemic event abruptly decreases. There are a number of effective therapies to consider for these patients after myocardial infarction. Careful patient assessment and individualized treatments are required for the maximum benefit. Patients with coronary artery disease can benefit from both medical and life-style secondary prevention measures. Nevertheless half of these patients in general practice does not have the opportunity for an effective medical intervention. Thus, there appears to be a considerable gap between the ideal management and the actual management in practice of these patients. Several types of strategies to improve disease management may be ineffective. Rehabilitation Centers can assure a continuum in the standard care for patients with coronary artery disease and thus they represent a plus value in secondary prevention.",,Sabino Scardi;Carmine Mazzone

The mortality from myocardial infarction decreased significantly among men during this period but not among women. The incidence of hospital-treated infarction increased significantly among men, mainly due to an increase in primary infarctions. The one-year survival in this hospital material did not improve during the period. The number of days of sick-leave during 12 months before primary infarction was significantly higher than expected. The duration of sick-leave during the year after primary infarction remained unchanged throughout the period. The mortality figures relate to all age groups, comprising 2 111 men and 1 409 women. The hospital incidence relates to men and women aged 65 years or below and comprises 1 323 men and 279 women during the period concerned. The reduced mortality and increased incidence of hospital-treated infarction are probaby explained by the fact that more men seek hospital treatment, leading to a better prognosis. The long duration of sick-leave after infarction is probably due to causes other than strictly medical factors.",,S O Isacsson;B W Johansson
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12611119/,Clinical relevance of apoptosis in early and late post-infarction left ventricular remodeling,"Apoptosis may represent an important pathophysiological mechanism causing progressive myocardiocyte loss and left ventricular dilation, even late after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This review discusses the role of myocardial apoptosis on the basis of findings from experimental studies in animals and from observational studies in humans with the purpose of assessing the clinical relevance, determinants and mechanisms of myocardial apoptosis and the potential therapeutic implications. A more profound understanding of the impact of myocardiocyte loss on prognosis and of the mechanisms involved may lead to an improved understanding of cardiac remodeling and possibly to an improved patient care. In fact, among the potential modulators of myocardial apoptosis, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers have already been shown to improve the prognosis and symptoms in patients with post-infarction heart failure, and a reduction in myocardial apoptosis could partly contribute to such a beneficial effect. Several other putative factors could also modulate myocardial apoptosis after AMI, and many are currently under intense investigation. In particular, the infarct-related artery patency late after AMI may be a major clinical determinant of myocardial apoptosis and clinical benefits deriving from an open artery (the ""open-artery hypothesis""), such as a slowing down of the remodeling process and a reduced arrhythmic risk, could be due, at least in part, to a reduced apoptotic myocardiocyte loss.",,Antonio Abbate;Giuseppe Biondi-Zoccai;Alessandro Petrolini;Luigi M Biasucci;Alfonso Baldi

We present data from the Nottingham Heart Attack Register comparing 1982-84, when thrombolysis was not available, and 1989-90, when it was hospital policy to give thrombolysis to all patients who arrived within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms, in the absence of a specific contraindication. The number of patients referred with symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial infarction increased by 75% from 1982 to 1990; a diagnosis of ""possible infarction"" was made in about half of all patients in 1982-84 and 23% in 1989-90. Our current thrombolytic policy has had little impact on patient and general practitioner (GP) behaviour. The GP was contacted by most patients. The median time between the onset of a patient's symptoms and admission to hospital when the GP was involved was 229 min in 1982-84 and 210 min in 1989-90; when he was not involved in arranging the admission median times to admission were 89 min and 75 min, respectively. By 6 hours from symptom onset, 60% of patients had been admitted; by 12 hours, about 70% were in hospital and by 24 hours, 80%. Of 7855 patients admitted with suspected acute myocardial infarction in 1989-90, 4465 were admitted within 6 hours of symptom onset. Of these, 736 (16%) patients received a thrombolytic drug. 389 (9%) patients had a specific, documented contraindication to thrombolysis.

The aim of the study is to collect epidemiological data on myocardial infarction, to examine the natural history of the disease and to investigate the main characteristics on patient care in the pilot area. The program is using standardized diagnostic criteria and predefined electronic data record forms (eCRF). The pilot area consists of 5 districts in the capital, and Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg county. The area has 997 324 inhabitants. Eight cardiology departments, 5 with heart catheterization facility (C) in Budapest, four hospitals with one C in Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county have been responsible of the patients' care. After starting the program 16 other hospitals joined the program from different parts of Hungary. Between 1st of January 2010 and 1st of May 2011 4293 patients were registered, among them 52.1% with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), 42.1% with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), while 3% of the patients had unstable angina, and 2.8% of the cases had other diagnosis or the hospital diagnosis was missing in the eCRF. Authors compare the patients care with STEMI in five districts of Budapest and Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg county. In Budapest 79.7% of the 301 STEMI patients were treated in C and 84.6% of them were treated with primary percutaneous intervention (pPCI).

This is to better diagnose difficult cases such as ST changes during bundle branch block, posterior ST elevation and right-sided ST elevation during normal conduction, and aVR ST elevation. More importantly, this is to better characterize the STEMI for tailored reperfusion. The proposal is to develop a system capable of recording from multiple electrodes that one can apply onto oneself, and having analysis coordinated centrally via phone-internet transmission. This provides 'longitudinal' in addition to 'cross-sectional' ECG information. STEMI will be classified on a gray-scale according to its potential size and speed of Q wave evolution. The hypothesis is that large rapidly progressive STEMI is best treated by on-site fibrinolysis with prompt transferral to a percutaneous coronary intervention center; while small stuttering STEMI is best treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention despite a long delay.",ECG; Q waves; STEMI; internet; reperfusion; smart phones.,Cheuk-Kit Wong
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21619546/,MicroRNAs as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of myocardial infarction,"In spite of enormous efforts, myocardial infarction is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathological myocardial alterations in affected patients are not fully elucidated. Recent studies have uncovered an important regulatory role for microRNAs (miRNAs), a family of small non-coding RNA molecules which - by translational repression or messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation - primarily act as negative regulators of gene expression. MiRNAs have been identified as regulatory key players during cellular differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Recent work has unveiled an important impact of miRNAs on the pathophysiology of myocardial infarction and consecutive myocardial alterations, including arrhythmia, remodelling processes, cardiac fibrosis, and hypertrophia. Additionally, specific miRNAs have been identified to be either elevated or decreased in the blood plasma after myocardial infarction. Determination of miRNA expression levels therefore offers a potential prognostic and/or predictive value. Future therapeutic concepts aiming at attenuation of ischemia-induced harm and reduction of maladaptive changes may include strategies to influence altered miRNA expression patterns. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of the modulating role of miRNAs in pathological alterations occurring in myocardial infarction as well as currently available data concerning miRNAs as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.",,Jens Heyn;Christian Hinske;Patrick Möhnle;Benjamin Luchting;Andres Beiras-Fernandez;Simone Kreth

Randomized studies yielded a better outcome when a time gain of 90 min and more was achieved. Prehospital diagnosis of AMI is reliable. Moreover, out-of-hospital thrombolysis has no additional specific risks nor is it an obstacle for later percutaneous intervention.

Twenty-six patients who had anterior myocardial infarction caused by single-vessel disease at the left anterior descending coronary artery were involved. Patients were classified into the following four groups according to the stress-redistribution thallium scintigraphic findings before PTCA: complete redistribution (two cases), incomplete redistribution (12 cases), partial redistribution (seven cases) and no redistribution (five cases). In the group with complete redistribution, the extent of residual ischaemia in the infarct area decreased significantly after PTCA but infarct size only slightly. In the groups with incomplete and partial redistribution, the extent of residual ischaemia and infarct size decreased significantly after PTCA. In contrast, the group with no redistribution showed a slight decrease in the extent of residual ischaemia and a gradual decrease in infarct size beginning 3 months after PTCA. Clinical findings including electrocardiogram indicated that the patients with incomplete redistribution had more viable myocardium and the patients with no redistribution had more scarring. The groups with incomplete and partial redistribution showed characteristics intermediate between complete and no redistribution. The change of infarct area after PTCA was different between the four groups, but both residual ischaemia and infarct size decreased in all groups. Thus, PTCA of the infarct-related coronary artery is useful even in the patients with prior myocardial infarction, even in patients with no redistribution shown by stress thallium scan.",,H Chiba;T Uehara;K Hayashida;K Haze;H Kusuoka;T Nishimura

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25205071/,Signalling pathways and mechanisms of protection in pre- and postconditioning: historical perspective and lessons for the future,"Ischaemic pre- and postconditioning are potent cardioprotective interventions that spare ischaemic myocardium and decrease infarct size after periods of myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion. They are dependent on complex signalling pathways involving ligands released from ischaemic myocardium, G-protein-linked receptors, membrane growth factor receptors, phospholipids, signalling kinases, NO, PKC and PKG, mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channels, reactive oxygen species, TNF-α and sphingosine-1-phosphate. The final effector is probably the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and the signalling produces protection by preventing pore formation. Many investigators have worked to produce a roadmap of this signalling with the hope that it would reveal where one could intervene to therapeutically protect patients with acute myocardial infarction whose hearts are being reperfused. However, attempts to date to show efficacy of such an intervention in large clinical trials have been unsuccessful. Reasons for this inability to translate successes in the experimental laboratory to the clinical arena are evaluated in this review. It is suggested that all patients with acute coronary syndromes currently presenting to the hospital and being treated with platelet P2Y12 receptor antagonists, the current standard of care, are indeed already benefiting from protection from the conditioning pathways outlined earlier. If that proves to be the case, then future attempts to further decrease infarction will have to rely on interventions which protect by a different mechanism.",,Michael V Cohen;James M Downey

It is shown that block promotes the development of circulatory insufficiency in patients with myocardial infarction. The marked character of hemodynamic disorders and the changes induced in it by electric stimulation are determined in many respects by the functional condition of the left ventricle. In most patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by complete atrioventricular block, with the exception of those with a clinical picture of cardiogenic shock, the main values of hemodynamics demonstrated against the background of electric stimulation hardly differ from the corresponding values in patients with myocardial infarction and no disturbances of atrioventricular conduction. During electric stimulation of the heart in the contingent of patients examined, the external work of the heart and the ""tension/time"" index considerably increase which suggests a marked increase in the myocardium requirements in oxygen.

The majority of the patients (55.5%) were in functional class I of the NYHA, while 36.6% were in class II and 8.3% in class III. We conclude that long-term mortality of those patients with right ventricular infarction is not greater than that of other patients with myocardial infarction, and that the great majority have a favorable evolution in regard of functional capacity.

However, the time course and the mechanisms of muscle recovery after myocardial infarction are not completely understood. A large body of evidence suggests that most of the improvement occurs during the hospital phase and is related to early and sustained thrombolysis in myocardial infarction 3 flow in the IRA. Nevertheless, the relationship between IRA status and regional and global LV mechanics in the chronic phase of the disease remains controversial. Some late recovery may occur, either spontaneously or after revascularization, even in the absence of documented myocardial ischemia. The interplay between vessel patency, coronary flow grade and severity of the residual stenosis, and the presence of stunned or hibernating myocardium in the area at jeopardy may explain this delayed improvement. Although there seems to be a limited time window in which myocardium can be salvaged, timely testing for viability, particularly in patients with poor LV function, is justified even in a later phase of the disease to challenge potential cardiac recovery.",,M Anselmi;L Bolognese;S Chierchia;A Maggioni;P Marino

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22299378/,Cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction--a review,"Cardiogenic shock is characterized by inadequate tissue perfusion due to cardiac dysfunction and is the leading cause of death in patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction. Mortality from cardiogenic shock still remains high. The development of cardiogenic shock is rarely unexpected; most patients who develop cardiogenic shock do so within 48 hrs of admission, with only 10% shocked on arrival. Mortality rate is exceedingly high and reaches 70-80% in those treated conservatively. Early revascularization is the cornerstone treatment of acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock. According to the guidelines, revascularization is effective up to 36 hours after the onset of cardiogenic shock and performed within 18 hours after the diagnosis of cardiogenic shock. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention is the most efficient therapy to restore coronary flow in the infarct-related artery. However, invasive strategy in a developing country like ours is not only costly but also technically demanding. We present a case of acute myocardial infarction complicated with cardiogenic shock that underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention and also review the incidence, pathophysiology, management and outcome of cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction.",,Laxman Dubey;Sanjib Sharma;Mani Gautam;Samir Gautam;Sogunuru Guruprasad;Gangapatnam Subramanyam

Ischemic injury to the heart during myocardial infarction (MI) results in the cleavage of cMyBP-C in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and release of an N-terminal fragment (C0C1f) into the circulation. C0C1f has been shown to be pathogenic within cardiac tissue, leading to the development of heart failure. Based on its high levels and early release into the circulation post-MI, C0C1f may serve as a novel biomarker for diagnosing MI more effectively than current clinically used biomarkers. Over time, circulating C0C1f could trigger an autoimmune response leading to myocarditis and progressive cardiac dysfunction. Given the importance of cMyBP-C phosphorylation state in the context of proteolytic cleavage and release into the circulation post-MI, understanding the posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of cMyBP-C would help in further elucidating the role of this protein in health and disease. Accordingly, recent studies have implemented the latest proteomics approaches to define the PTMs of cMyBP-C. The use of such proteomics assays may provide accurate quantitation of the levels of cMyBP-C in the circulation following MI, which could, in turn, demonstrate the efficacy of using plasma cMyBP-C as a cardiac-specific early biomarker of MI. In this review, we define the pathogenic and potential immunogenic effects of C0C1f on cardiac function in the post-MI heart. We also discuss the most advanced proteomics approaches now used to determine cMyBP-C PTMs with the aim of validating C0C1f as an early biomarker of MI.",Autoantibodies; Biomarkers; Dilated cardiomyopathy; Myocardial infarction; cMyBP-C.,Thomas L Lynch;Sakthivel Sadayappan

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2665468/,New concepts in the pathophysiology of acute myocardial infarction,"Recent findings concerning the pathophysiology of acute myocardial infarction are reviewed and related to the potential for myocardial salvage. The myocardial infarction process can be divided into 2 phases, an early evolving phase (the first 6 hours) and a later convalescent phase. An evolving infarction is associated with an occluded coronary artery; in most cases, a thrombotic occlusion occurs. The human coronary artery normally has an intact endothelium, which has protective vasodilatory and antiplatelet-aggregating effects that are lost when the endothelium is damaged. The endothelium is exquisitely sensitive to trauma and can be damaged by high shear stress produced by narrowing of the coronary arteries that is not associated with reduced coronary blood flow. In addition, during this acute endothelial damage, monocellular infiltration of the coronary arteries has the potential to release factors that may cause platelet aggregation, enhance blood coagulation, attract other white blood cells or exert other effects on the coronary tree. Myocardial damage occurring in the early evolving stage is usually responsive to treatment that either restores myocardial oxygen supply or reduces myocardial oxygen demand. However, coronary events occurring after the first 6 hours usually are not responsive to such treatment. Certain clinical variables may shorten or extend the time period within which damaged myocardium can be saved. The findings suggest important approaches for intervention to modify the acute phase.",,C J Pepine

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17129510/,Left ventricular diastolic function following myocardial infarction,"An acute myocardial infarction causes a loss of contractile fibers which reduces systolic function. Parallel to the effect on systolic function, a myocardial infarction also impacts diastolic function, but this relationship is not as well understood. The two physiologic phases of diastole, active relaxation and passive filling, are both influenced by myocardial ischemia and infarction. Active relaxation is delayed following a myocardial infarction, whereas left ventricular stiffness changes depending on the extent of infarction and remodeling. Interstitial edema and fibrosis cause an increase in wall stiffness which is counteracted by dilation. The effect on diastolic function is correlated to an increased incidence of adverse outcomes. Moreover, patients with comorbid conditions that are associated with worse diastolic function tend to have more adverse outcomes after infarction. There are currently no treatments aimed specifically at treating diastolic dysfunction following a myocardial infarction, but several new drugs, including aldosterone antagonists, may offer promise.",,Jens Jakob Thune;Scott D Solomon

It prevents the development of cardiac dilatation, it retards progression of the disease and the development of cardiac failure and reduces the necessity of hospitalization in patients with chronic cardiac failure (stage NYHA II-IV). ACE inhibitors are the drug of choice as they reduce significantly the general mortality of these patients. Treatment should not be initiated in the acute stage but after several days have elapsed after infarction, unless contraindications of treatment are present. Extensive investigations made during the past two years revealed moreover that ACE inhibitors effectively prevent also relapses of myocardial infarction or the development of unstable angina pectoris. Prevention of coronary attacks is most probably due to several effects of ACE inhibitors: a) reduction of blood pressure, b) coronary vasodilatation, c) the antiproliferative action of ACE inhibitors on vascular musculature, d) prevention of progression of atherosclerosis, e) prevention of myocardial hypertrophy, f) the favourable effect on endothelial function.

The echocardiogram demonstrated a large RV/LV minor axis ratio caused by a volume overload of the right ventricle and an underfilled left ventricle. The interventricular septum showed abnormal movement, presumably due to right ventricular overload or severe disease of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Diminished septal systolic thickening, as seen in our patient, may be explained by extension of the infarct from the right ventricle to the adjacent part of the septum.

A female patient aged 65 years was brought to the emergency room due to loss of consciousness 1 hour before. From the patient's history, it was understood that she had undergone stent placement to her proximal RCA 5 days before. On ECG, a decreasing elevation in ST segment elevation from V1 to V4 was seen, and pathologic Q waves were present at DIII and AVF. A complete AV block was detected on ECG. In the coronary angiography, thrombosis of the stent in the proximal RCA was seen. Stenosis detected in the mid-left anterior descending artery was 50% and at the distal part was 60%. The circumflex coronary artery was found normal. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed to the 95% thrombotic lesion in the stent of the proximal RCA, and full patency was established. In our case, a decreasing elevation in the ST segment elevation from V1 to V4 was seen. Right ventricular MI usually occurs by an acute stenosis of the non-dominant proximal RCA branch that does not receive collateral flow. In our case, RCA was codominant and an acute stenosis of the stent in the proximal RCA was present. The occlusion of the non-dominant RCA can appear as isolated right ventricular MI without causing a left ventricular infarct, since it does not feed the left ventricle.",,Cağlar Ozmen;Ali Deniz;Mehmet Kanadaşı

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7904445/,[Circadian changes of myocardial infarction],"Several studies have demonstrated a circadian rhythm in the onset of myocardial infarction. Most show a peak rate between 8 and 12 o'clock in the morning. The frequency of infarction in this time period is one and a half to two times that observed during the rest of the day. This phenomenon has been observed in different countries and does not seem to be influenced by the characteristics of the population (sex, previous infarction). However, this circadian rhythm seems less pronounced in younger subjects. The prescription of calcium antagonists before infarction does not change the circadian rhythm whereas aspirin and betablocker therapy decrease the frequency of matinal infarction. The mechanism underlying the circadian rhythm is hypothetical: many factors could play a triggering role and circadian variations in coagulation, platelet aggregation, catecholamine levels and blood pressure may also be important. Recent studies have shown that the morning peak in onset of infarction could be related to the times of waking and getting up. Suppression of the morning peak of infarction (and also of episodes of myocardial ischaemia and sudden death) with betablocker therapy, suggests a direct or indirect role of circulating catecholamines in the induction of the phenomena leading to infarction. When using betablockers, the authors suggest prescribing the doses so as to obtain therapeutic efficacy in the morning.",,A Leizorovicz;H Decousus

These effects include the ability to reduce early, life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, improvement in ultimate long-term survival from an ischaemic insult with or without subsequent reperfusion and a reduction in the extent and degree of myocardial (and microvascular) ischaemic damage. Most of the evidence for protection, however, comes from studies in which drugs have been administered before the onset of ischaemia. Much less is known about the effects of intervening with beta-blocking drugs after the commencement of the ongoing infarction process. Although beta-blockers have a great deal to offer in the experimental situation there remains the strong possibility that other approaches might be able to offer even more. One promising approach is the combination of a beta-blocking drug with a specific inhibitor of thromboxane synthesis.",,J R Parratt

In 100 (79%) patients, the prehospital time was less than or equal to 6 hours; of these, 61 (61%) were retrospectively judged to have been optimal candidates for lytic therapy. Stepwise multiple regression selected the following 4 variables as independent predictors of prehospital time: slow symptom progression; low income; female gender; and advanced age. All of these variables are predictive (p less than 0.03) of increased prehospital time; absence of prior AMI was of borderline additional significance (p = 0.053). Similarly, logistic regression analysis selected slow symptom progression, female gender and low income as significant (p less than or equal to 0.02) independent predictors of prehospital time greater than 6 hours. The logistic regression model incorporating these 3 variables had a sensitivity of 54%, a specificity of 95% and a positive predictive value of 72% in identifying patients with prehospital time greater than 6 hours.

The prevalence of ambulatory ischaemia after myocardial infarction seems to be lower than in other subgroups with coronary artery disease. In postinfarction patients, however, a greater proportion of ischaemic episodes are silent. At present there is substantial evidence that ambulatory ischaemia provides prognostic information in different subsets of patients with previous myocardial infarction, but there is considerable disagreement about how this is expressed in terms of cardiac events. Patient selection, small patient numbers, and different timing of ambulatory monitoring are proposed as important reasons for the inconsistent findings.

Clonidine was administered intravenously in a dose of 5 micrograms/kg over a 5-min period. Hemodynamic parameters (Swan-Ganz thermodilution catheter), systolic time intervals (Weissler), and calculated hemodynamic indexes were measured both before and 60 min after cessation of intravenous injection. Blood pressure fell from 161 +/- 20 to 126 +/- 19 mm Hg (systolic) and from 105 +/- 7.6 to 84.7 +/- 9 mm Hg diastolic. Overall, clonidine produced a decrease in total systemic resistance (-21%). Cardiac index did not change significantly (-3%). Left ventricular stroke work index was significantly reduced (-21%, p less than 0.001), as was the triple product, suggesting a favorable effect of clonidine on myocardial oxygen supply/demand ratio. This may result in a reduction in infarct size.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,A Foresti;F M Massari;A Lotto

The use of NLA within the first 5 days of the infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock decreased the intensity of the myocardial damage in the zone around the infarction and prevented necrotic changes in teh ""extra-infarction"" myocardium. Consequently, cardiosclerosis developing after the infarction had a smaller size and at a lesser degree decreased the contractile capacity of the heart muscle and its energy supply. The protective influence of NLA on the myocardium in cardiogenic shock is brought about through the action of the preparations on the various pathogenetic components of shock upon which the size of the myocardial damage depends.",,N G Gordadze;Z G Tsagareli

Complete versus Culprit Vessel revascularization in acute ST--elevation myocardial infarction,"The best strategy regarding percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in multivessel disease is an unresolved issue. Although current guidelines recommend that PCI in non-culprit arteries should not be attempted unless the patient is hemodynamically unstable, it is unclear whether PCI of the infarct-related artery only or a strategy of complete revascularization, either in a simultaneous or staged multivessel PCI approach, will improve outcome. Based on available data, PCI of the culprit lesion has the advantages of shorter procedure duration, a smaller amount of dye used, and a lower rate of periprocedural myocardial infarctions, while complete revascularization has lower rates of recurrent angina and a better left ventricular ejection fraction. Although data available give controversial results for the right strategy to choose, the only adequately powered randomized controlled trial shows that a strategy of multivessel PCI should be pursued notwithstanding the timing of complete revascularization. However, to avoid the potential risks of simultaneous multivessel PCI, a strategy of staged complete revascularization appears to be the best choice. It should be considered whether current guidelines should be changed to account for these considerations, and other adequately powered randomized controlled trials should be performed to endorse current knowledge.",,R V Jeger;M E Pfisterer

A challenge],"Better management of patients with acute myocardial infarction during the prehospital phase is at present a challenge not only for health workers but for society as a whole. The authors pay attention to knowledge of the complex problem of the prehospital phase in patients with acute myocardial infarction which is a prerequisite for finding possible solutions for a favourable effect on their management. The authors analyzed 3,040 patients who were admitted to hospital alive within 96 hours after the development of complaints with suspicion of a first or repeated acute myocardial infarction. They focused attention in particular on prehospital time delay. They found that within a satisfactory time interval (within 2 hours) 29.8% patients were delivered and within a yet acceptable interval of 4 hours 51.6% patients (with respect to effectiveness of thrombolytic treatment). Similarly undesirable are also data on the patient time delay. Within the optimal first hour after development of complaints following the decision of the patient (subjects present) to ask for or seek medical assistance was the decision of 34% patients, during the first two hours 47.5% and within 4 hours 61.2% patients with acute myocardial infarction. The ratio of time delay of the patient in the total prehospital delay is 45.5% even in patients who were admitted during the first hour after development of acute myocardial infarction. In patients who were admitted 4 hours after development of complaints it is 79.5%. The patient is admitted to hospital most quickly if he calls the medical emergency service and latest when he decides to see a doctor. Physicians and other health workers contributed only in 16.4-20.9% patients with acute myocardial infarction to their early decision to seek medical assistance. Patients with an early decision (within one hour) call most frequently the medical emergency service and are taken to hospital by this service. The time delay due to transport is shortest in these patients. The late hospital admission of patients with acute myocardial infarction in Slovakia calls for reduction of the time interval from the development of complaints to hospital admission (total prehospital delay), in particular the time taken by the patient to make up his mind (patient time delay). Early calling of the emergency medical service and transport of the maximum possible number of patients with acute myocardial infarction to hospital by the emergency medical service will greatly improve the management of patients with acute myocardial infarction. Comprehensive implementation of the survival chain (24), the most comprehensive implementation of recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology and the European Resuscitation Council for in the management of patients with acute heart attacks during the prehospital phase (21) and early effective treatment which begins already in the prehospital phase has a favourable impact on the condition of patients with acute myocardial infarction and on their prognosis. Along with early and effective treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction in hospital and their stratification these are the most important approaches to the development and control of sudden cardiac death. Knowledge of the complex problem of the prehospital phase in patients with acute myocardial infarction is the prerequisite for the elaboration of high standard prehospital management of patients with acute myocardial infarction.",,S Cagán;M Pavlovic;R Stefanovic;J Murín;S Wimmerová;I Besedová;T Trnovec
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6735326/,[Acute myocardial infarct in the aged. Omissions in treatment],The pre-hospital phase of acute myocardial infarction may be of crucial importance for the further fate of the subject. Mortality of old people seems to be twice that of middle aged persons during the pre-hospital phase of acute infarction. This may be due partially to the longer duration of latency between onset of symptoms and arrival at the hospital of older patients causing waste of time especially for resuscitation from lethal arrhythmias. The delay of therapy is promoted by difficulties in diagnosis due to lack of typical pain often veiled by other symptoms and failure of the electrocardiogram in old patients. Need of urgent hospitalization for reduction of pre-hospital mortality seems not to have been generally accepted among general practitioners. Standard management of emergency care of patients with suspected myocardial infarction is reviewed.,,J Slany
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/380605/,Coronary artery vasospasm: the likely immediated cause of acute myocardial infarction,"Features of infarction can be divided into two types--the spasmodic and the mechanical. The former (pre-infarct angina and emotional factors in infarction) seem readily explainable by spasm, and are similar to the findings in angina which prompted Heberden to consider angina as spasmodic. The mechanical features of infarction (association with thrombosis and arteriosclerosis, and severe and unremitting chest pain) seem to be the antithesis of spasm and probably account for the reluctance to consider spasm seriously in infarction. The injury-vasospasm hypothesis of acute myocardial infarction explains both spasmodic and mechanical features. Spasm represents a dominance of vasoconstricting over vasodilating forces. Coronary sclerosis can result in both ischaemia (vasodilating) and ischaemic injury-spasm (vasoconstricting). The fight-flight component of the autonomic nervous system is considered to be vasodilating, and the conservation-withdrawal portion to be vasoconstricting. Once spasm occurs, a new balance of forces obtains which can lead either to vasodilatation and relief of symptoms or to infarction.",,H R Hellstrom

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6624656/,Early recognition of the patient at late high risk: incomplete infarction and vulnerable myocardium,"The process of identifying patients with myocardial infarction (MI) at high risk after hospital discharge should begin at admission. By using basic clinical and laboratory information, enhanced by a wide variety of noninvasive tests, not only can individual patients at risk be recognized, but also the processes that determine risk can, at least in part, be appreciated. Outcome is affected by the extent of damaged tissue and, apparently, by the amount of potentially ischemic muscle. MI may change the coronary circulation such that a new and fragile balance between supply and demand results, both within and outside the infarct zone; that is, the infarct may be incomplete and the viable muscle within it may then be vulnerable to later ischemia. Muscle outside the infarct zone may be left in much the same precarious state. Also, coronary spasm may not be infrequent in the weeks after MI. These factors together may underlie recurrent post-MI myocardial ischemia.",,A D Sniderman;J P Beaudry;D P Rahal

Evidence of reduced regional coronary flow in spite of normal coronary arteries,"A normal coronary arteriogram after transmural myocardial infarction is a well-recognised phenomenon, but the pathophysiology remains unclear in most cases. A possible aetiological role of oral contraceptives is suggested by the occurrence of unequivocal myocardial infarction with normal or near normal coronary arteries in 4 young women who had been taking oral contraceptives. While the cause-effect relation of coronary thrombosis and myocardial infarction remains controversial in patients with coronary atherosclerosis, a primary occlusion of macroscopically normal coronary arteries by cellular elements of blood appears possible in these cases. The action of contraceptives, the, would be analogous to their thrombogenic effect in peripheral veins and cerebral arteries. Absence of atherosclerotic lesions in these patients favours spontaneous thrombolysis and restoration of normal vessel patency in many of these cases. Myocardial blood flow in the region of the damaged left ventricular wall remains low in spite of normal coronary arteries. Reduced perfusion in infarcted areas is assumed to be the consequence of structural and functional alterations at precapillary and capillary level rather than an effect of obstructive coronary disease.",,H J Engel;H Hundeshagen;P Lichtlen

Human and animal studies have described the mechanisms responsible for the thinning and enlargement that progresses for years beyond the initial infarction. As a result of elevations in preload and afterload, ventricular pressures increase, and changes occur in both the infarcted and uninfarcted regions of the ventricle, increasing overall heart size. Recent investigation has demonstrated that the initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drugs after myocardial infarction reduces both systolic and diastolic wall stresses, thereby averting changes in heart size. These findings are significant, as increases in heart size and ventricular volumes have proved to be powerful predictors of early mortality after myocardial infarction.",,A M Fara

Of the 228 regions evaluated by equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography, 135 had abnormal regional wall motion and 102 (76%) of these 135 regions had evidence of myocardial infarction at autopsy. The overall sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of regional wall motion abnormality for regional necrosis or scar were 69, 59 and 76%, respectively. Of the 33 false positive regions, 20 (61%) had severe narrowing of the coronary artery supplying that region, 13 (39%) were adjacent to a region with a myocardial infarction and almost half (16 [48%]) were in the lateral wall. Eighty-three (36%) of the 228 regions were akinetic or dyskinetic, 52 (23%) were hypokinetic and 93 (41%) were normal. Sixty-three (76%) of the 83 akinetic/dyskinetic segments had transmural myocardial infarction at autopsy, 14 (17%) had nontransmural myocardial infarction and only 6 (7%) contained no necrosis or scar. In contrast, 14 (27%) of 52 hypokinetic segments had transmural myocardial infarction, 11 (21%) had nontransmural myocardial infarction and 27 (52%) were normal. Thus, the most severe regional wall motion abnormality (akinesia/dyskinesia) almost always indicates regional myocardial infarction which is usually transmural whereas less severe dysfunction (hypokinesia) is not necessarily associated with regional necrosis or scar.

Acetylsalicylic acid is also likely to be beneficial with little risk of adverse events in this setting.

Since then, numerous studies have been presented, which have led to important conclusions. Among pharmacological interventions, the opinion on adjuncts to anticoagulant treatment in the area of thrombolysis as well as in primary coronary intervention seems to be moving away from unfractionated heparin towards low molecular weight heparin, and possibly even factor Xa-specific pentasaccharide or the direct antithrombin bivalirudin. Clopidogrel has developed to become an accepted standard alongside aspirin in thrombolytic therapy of ST-elevation myocardial infarction, even if some questions still remain open. The promising idea of ""facilitated percutaneous coronary intervention"" has shown itself to at least be problematic if performed immediately and routinely after thrombolysis; ""rescue"" intervention in the event of ineffective thrombolysis is, on the other hand, useful and effective. Apparently, a more individualistic approach is required, which combines new therapeutic options and patients' conditions on the one side with regional resources on the other, to produce an optimal and timely strategy, remembering that one size does not fit all.",,H-R Arntz
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15568150/,[Mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction],"Rupture of the left ventricular myocardium during the course of an acute myocardial infarction may affect the free wall, the interventricular septum, or the papillary muscles. When a rupture occurs, it is referred to as a mechanical complication of acute myocardial infarction. All mechanical complications may lead to cardiogenic shock. However, the location of the rupture can often be suspected clinically. To confirm the diagnosis, echocardiography must be performed. Since the advent of thrombolytic therapy and percutaneous coronary intervention, the incidence of mechanical complications has declined. Even though mortality remains high, their recognition is important since survivors may have an excellent long-term prognosis. The cases convey two main messages: 1) Mechanical complications must be carefully searched for in any patient with an acute coronary syndrome and signs of cardiogenic shock and/or a systolic murmur. 2) Aggressive and timely medical and surgical treatment should be provided even though in a substantial proportion of these patients prognosis may be dismal.",,T Brunschwig;F R Eberli;T Herren

Compared to body surface electrocardiography this new device facilitated easy recording and analysis for display on eight-colored spatial mapping electrocardiography at points equivalent to those on a terrestrial globe at intervals of 20 degrees longitude and 10 degrees latitude. In this study, the extent and direction of the Q waves were easily recognized with the aid of a colored display and mapping electrocardiography. To quantitatively evaluate infarct size, the total Q wave area (sigma Aq) was calculated from the mapping electrocardiograms of 12 patients with anteroseptal myocardial infarction, and compared with thallium defect scores obtained by single photon emission CT (SPECT) and the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF). Defect scores were calculated using short-axis images. Sigma Aq was correlated with defect scores and EF (r = 0.83, 0.45, respectively).

The mortality rate was 6% (1/3 of hospital deaths) in the period from the 7th day to discharge from hospital (14th to 30th day). Cardiac arrest as not uncommon (20% of all cardiac arrests) but the prognosis was better thn during the initial phase (p less than 0.05) as the mechanism was more commonly ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia (p less than 0.05). This series was compared with a similar population from 1970-1973; an improvement was observed in global hospital mortality (27% previously compared to 17%, in the study series, p less than 0.001). As the population were comparable, this phenomenon seems to be related to better treatment of shock and cardiac failure and the advances in cardiac surgery during the initial phase of infarction. Thd commonest mechanical complication was ventricular aneurysm; its occurrence does not influence the vital prognosis during this period. The incidence of cardiac arrest and death due to cardiac failure is not negligible after the first week of myocardial infarction. Therefore, we do not believe that the hospital period should be reduced after myocardial infarction. Special training of the nursing staff is essential for the successful treatment of these complications.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3318073/,Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography in acute myocardial infarction and its complications,"Two-dimensional echocardiography is an outstanding and unique bedside diagnostic and prognostic method for cardiologists facing the early diagnosis and complications of acute myocardial infarction. Its advantages are safety, rapidity, portability, and relatively low costs. It is suitable for evaluation of global and, more importantly, segmental myocardial function. Segmental wall motion analysis reliably detects, localizes, and estimates the extent of myocardial infarction in the first hours after onset of symptoms. In addition, it is the most sensitive method to diagnose right ventricular infarction and provides information predictive of early and late postinfarct complications. In postinfarct hemodynamic deterioration two-dimensional echocardiography allows one to distinguish primary pump failure from mechanical complications as: rupture of the free wall, of the ventricular septum or mitral valve dysfunction. In the subacute stage complications as ventricular (pseudo) aneurysm and thrombus may be diagnosed by two-dimensional echocardiography. Combined Doppler echocardiographic examination provides reliable information about the presence of insufficiency or shunting. Thus, echocardiography has become indispensable at the coronary care unit as it provides a complete picture of cardiac structure and function making it superior to most other methods in the clinical situation of an acute myocardial infarction with such a volatile and unpredictable course. This is an argument to house an echo/Doppler instrument in the coronary care unit.",,P E Assmann;J R Roelandt
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18848692/,Reperfusion injury in acute myocardial infarction. From bench to cath lab. Part I: Basic considerations,"Early reperfusion during evolving myocardial infarction is essential for saving myocardium and patients' lives. Nevertheless, lethal reperfusion injury can occur, limiting myocardial salvage. Numerous experimental studies have proved the deleterious effects of reoxygenating endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. The major breakthrough was the proof that the success of myocardial reperfusion can be modified by preconditioning and, more recently, by postconditioning, a form of progressive and interrupted reperfusion. Three theories have been put forward to explain reperfusion injury: (1) oxidative stress resulting in a burst of oxygen-radical formation, which can cause membrane damage; (2) the energy paradox, which suggests that restarting energetic mitochondrial machinery results in myofibrillar hypercontracture, cytoskeleton fragility and membrane rupture; and (3) the role of inflammation, which addresses the effects of leucocyte accumulation and activation. Fortunately, reperfusion injury salvage kinases can be up-regulated and in some circumstances may block, in a manner similar to pre- or postconditioning, the diabolical cycle leading to necrosis and/or apoptosis of viable cells. The end effectors of the survival system are two mitochondrial channels - the mK-ATP channel and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Better understanding of these salutary molecular mechanisms and their triggers may result in a new era of reperfusion techniques.",,Jean Pierre Monassier

This study details the case of a 16-year-old male who presented with new-onset chest pain and ST elevation on electrocardiogram. His history was unremarkable for known cardiac risk factors, but laboratory evaluation demonstrated markedly elevated troponins and electrocardiographic findings confirmed ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15362543/,[Iatrogenic myocardial infarction],"In this paper, iatrogenic myocardial infarction resulting from percutaneous catheter intervention (PCI) and cardiac surgery is described. Among the patients who had experienced iatrogenic myocardial infarction in the past 4 years, 6 had undergone emergent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). An emergent operation for myocardial infarction was performed on 3 patients, for problems associated with PCI, and 1 patient had died due to cardiac failure. In the latter case, although the emergent CABG was performed after the failure of percutaneous coronary intervention in another hospital, no improvement in cardiac function was observed. The reason for this was that the myocardial damage became almost irreversible due to the delay in transferring the patient to our hospital. An additional CABG was performed in 2 cases, because they experienced a cardiogenic shock after cessation of the cardio-pulmonary bypass system. In these cases, cardiac function had improved immediately after an additional CABG. Some ST elevation in the electrocardiograms was observed in 8 cases in the intensive care unit after isolated CABG. One patient experienced a cardiogenic shock, and was transferred to the operating room immediately. The radial artery graft connected in sequence to circumflex coronary arteries was spastic, and an additional bypass was performed to the same coronary arteries using a saphenous vein graft. Although conservative medical therapy was administered in the remaining 7 cases, 1 case presented an occlusion of the left descending coronary artery, and an emergent CABG should have been performed. ST elevations in 2 cases were caused by coronary spasm, while in the remaining 4 cases, they were caused by pericardiotomy. Although a postoperative change in the electrocardiogram was considered important, the diagnosis was complicated. In myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock develops easily, and an emergent CABG is needed in many cases.

In addition, it is clear that although the relative risk associated with heavy exertion may be high, the absolute risk is actually quite small. It also is clear that regular exercise reduces the risk of triggering of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death by isolated bouts of exertion. Thus, these data provide further support for encouragement of regular exercise, as recommended by the American Heart Association.

Specific recommendations for patients with a history of myocardial infarction or angina are complex. Patients with coronary artery disease have the same relative risk of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death as those with no such history. Because of their elevated and variable baseline risk, however, specific recommendations regarding the risks and benefits of heavy physical exertion must be provided by their individual physicians, acting on recommended guidelines for exercise in such patients.",,M A Mittleman;D S Siscovick

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2916403/,Assessment of myocardial infarct size by means of T2-weighted 1H nuclear magnetic resonance imaging,"Proton (1H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging is thought to depict zones of recent myocardial infarction in contrast to noninfarcted myocardium. This is related to T2 increases in infarct zones that have been verified previously by relaxometry measurements in excised myocardial samples. Accordingly the present study was undertaken to evaluate a 1H NMR imaging method to optimize T2 contrast and measure infarct size in a high-field imaging system (1.5 T). To accomplish this, NMR images were acquired every other R wave with echo times of 30 and 100 msec. The first echo image was used for myocardial border definition and the second echo image, which highlighted the myocardial infarction, for infarct border definition. This T2-weighted approach yielded a significant correlation between infarct size by NMR and pathologic methods. However, NMR imaging tended to overestimate infarct size, and the NMR image depicted abnormal signal well beyond the extent of the pathology-determined infarct. There was a significant relationship between NMR-imaged infarct size and myocardial mass with microsphere-determined reduction in blood flow of 25% or more. These data suggest that T2-weighted NMR imaging depicts not only infarct but also some reversibly injured myocardium.",,A Bouchard;R C Reeves;G Cranney;S P Bishop;G M Pohost

In the settings of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, significant mortality benefit has been observed in randomized trials of coronary stent procedures compared with medical therapy alone. However, data regarding procedural choices, and particularly stent choices, are limited, and significant controversy exists. Drug-eluting stents were introduced in the United States in 2003 and have been widely adopted based on profound reduction in restenosis. Yet recent years have witnessed a decline in use of drug-eluting stents in the setting of myocardial infarction due to long-term safety concerns. We review the current data regarding drug-eluting stent performance relative to bare metal stents in the setting of acute myocardial infarction with regard to effectiveness, safety, and the need for adjunctive long-term pharmacologic therapy.",,Rahul Sakhuja;Laura Mauri
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7899950/,Causes of delay in seeking treatment for heart attack symptoms,"With the advent of thrombolytic therapy and other coronary reperfusion strategies, rapid identification and treatment of acute myocardial infarction greatly reduces mortality. Unfortunately, many patients delay seeking medical care and miss the benefits afforded by recent advances in treatment. Studies have shown that the median time from onset of symptoms to seeking care ranges from 2 to 61/2 hours, while optimal benefit is derived during the first hour from symptom onset. The phenomenon of delay by AMI patients and those around them needs to be understood prior to the design of education and counseling strategies to reduce delay. In this article the literature is reviewed and variables that increase patient delay are identified. A theoretical model based on the health belief model, a self regulation model of illness cognition, and interactionist role theory is proposed to explain the response of an individual to the signs and symptoms of acute myocardial infarction. Finally, recommendations are made for future research.",,K Dracup;D K Moser;M Eisenberg;H Meischke;A A Alonzo;A Braslow
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2653635/,Interventional therapy in acute myocardial infarction,"Large multicenter trials have shown an improvement in both survival and left ventricular function in patients undergoing reperfusion therapy in acute myocardial infarction. The most practical approach in treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction involves intravenous administration of effective thrombolytic agents as soon as possible in the course of myocardial infarction. This approach using r-tPA results in reperfusion in approximately two-thirds of patients. In patients with contraindications to thrombolytic therapy and extensive injury current or hemodynamic compromise, emergent cardiac catheterization should be performed followed by immediate PTCA or bypass surgery. In patients who have already been treated with thrombolytic agents, controversy exists as to the optimal timing of cardiac catheterization to define coronary anatomy and the need for additional revascularization. We suggest that the most beneficial therapeutic strategy for the majority of patients is rapid administration of an effective intravenous thrombolytic agent combined with aspirin and heparin. Cardiac catheterization and PTCA or coronary artery bypass graft surgery may be deferred in stable patients. This approach is supported by evidence showing a lack of additional improvement in mortality and left ventricular function in patients treated with urgent PTCA. The advent of new therapeutic modalities in acute myocardial infarction, such as thrombolysis, has created a new subset of patients who either will have an improved prognosis if coronary artery reperfusion is completed or will have an increased risk for recurrent myocardial ischemia if definite revascularization is delayed.",,A Zalewski;S Goldberg

The exercise-isoproterenol (E-1) and exercise control (EC) groups exercised daily for thirty days on a treadmill at 1 mph, 2% grade while animals of the sedentary-isoproterenol (S-I) group remained sedentary. Eight animals were assigned to the sedentary control (SC) group which remained sedentary throughout the experimental period. Forty-eight hours after the final exercise period, S-I and E-I animals received a single subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (250 mg/kg body weight). Animals of the S-I group exhibited significantly (Pp less than 0.05) greater mortality from the effects of isoproterenol than animals of the E-I group. Serum CPK activity for E-I animals was significantly (p less than 0.05) greater than for animals in the S-I and EC groups twenty hours following isoproterenol injection. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two isoproterenol treated groups for severity of the induced lesions, changes in heart weight, or heart weight to body weight ratios. The results indicated that exercise reduced the mortality associated with the effects of large dosages of isoproterenol but had little on the severity of the infarction.",,C E Riggs Jr;C W Landiss;G T Jessup;H W Bonner

'Evidence-based' practice is essential but extrapolation to the individual patient is always necessary and this fact is well illustrated by data from trials of ACE inhibitors post-myocardial infarction. In the AIRE (Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy) study, 2,006 patients with some evidence of heart failure, even if transient, after a myocardial infarction, were randomised to receive oral ramipril or placebo in addition to standard treatment. Follow-up was for a minimum of six and an average of 15 months. The risk reduction in total mortality was 27% (95% CI 11-40%; p = 0.002); approximately 40 lives might be expected to be saved for every 1000 patients treated for one year. Benefit was apparent within weeks of starting treatment. Additional data from the AIRE study are considered in relation to the findings of other mortality trials.

Morphologic changes in the coronary arteries at the site of revascularization included injury to the inner portion of the arterial wall (intimal splitting, subintimal dissection, medial tears and submedial dissection) and necrosis of medial smooth muscle cells. Residual mural thrombi and thrombotic reocclusion were noted within the arterial lumen. There was a beginning neointima formation in all patients who died early and a reobstructing neointima proliferation in the patient who died late after PTCA. The results of this study support the suggestion that both rupture and dissection of the inner arterial wall and necrosis of the tunica media resulting from irreversible dilatation of the grossly intact outer layers are the most important mechanisms of PTCA. Response to arterial wall injury after PTCA is a neointima formation leading to covering of mural thrombi and thrombogenic intimal, medial and adventitial substances and smoothing of the luminal surface. Large residual mural thrombi and excessive neointimal proliferation may cause restenosis within a few weeks.",,C Düber;A Jungbluth;H J Rumpelt;R Erbel;J Meyer;W Thoenes

It is also difficult to explain why patients treated late have a reduced mortality after thrombolytic treatment. Uncertainty prevails on the validity of thrombolysis in patients with a low and very high risk of mortality. Resistance of coronary occlusion to any thrombolytic is another unexplained fact. Alteplase and saruplase are more fibrin-specific thrombolytic drugs than anistreplase.

ST depression was more common in inferior infarcts (72%) than in anterior (37%) ones. It occurred more frequently in complicated infarcts and in the presence of considerable ST elevation. Patients experiencing second or third degree heart block were significantly more likely to show reciprocal changes. The rise in peak cardiac enzyme concentration was higher in patients showing ST depression. In patients with ST depression, peak creatine kinase concentration was 46% higher, aspartate aminotransferase was 39% higher, and lactate dehydrogenase 29% higher after correction for site and complications. A discriminant function analysis selected infarct site, peak aspartate aminotransferase, and magnitude of ST elevation as predictors of the occurrence of ST depression. Age, severity, and smoking status did not significantly improve discrimination. Despite larger increases in peak enzyme concentrations patients with ST depression had marginally fewer subsequent episodes of unstable angina or fatal or non-fatal infarction and a marginally lower 10 year death rate. Neither difference was statistically significant. ST depression occurring early in the acute phase of myocardial infarction is likely to be a reflection of electrophysiological changes taking place at the site of the infarct that is manifested in the contralateral surface of the heart.

Clinical presentation: We report the case of a 16-year-old girl who presented a myocardial infarction for whom a coronary-computer tomography did not reveal any coronary abnormalities or obstruction. She had a livedo reticularis on her physical exam. Intervention: The echocardiography showed a normal left ventricular function and a mild eccentric mitral regurgitation. A myocardial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated transmural necrosis with microvascular obstruction at the inferobasal segment of the left ventricle, suggestive of a microvascular myocardial infarction. The blood test showed elevation of the three antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-β2-glycoprotein). The lupus anticoagulant remained positive 12 weeks later, fulfilling the laboratory criteria for antiphospolipid carrier. The associated presence of this microvascular coronary obstruction was strongly suggestive of antiphospholipd syndrome, according to the revised Sapporo criteria. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of antiphospholipid syndrome manifesting as an acute microvascular myocardial infarction, confirmed by myocardial magnetic resonance imaging.

Multiple clinical and historical factors predict the presence of one or more of these prognostic indicators.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10190507/,Efficacy of invasive strategy for the management of acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock,"This retrospective study evaluates the influence of an invasive strategy of urgent coronary revascularization on the in-hospital mortality of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicated early by cardiogenic shock. Among 1,981 patients with AMI admitted to our institution from 1994 to 1997, 162 patients (8.2%) developed cardiogenic shock unrelated to mechanical complications. The strategy of management was considered invasive if an urgent coronary angiography was indicated within 24 hours of symptom onset. Every other strategy was considered conservative. Fifty-seven patients who developed the shock late or after a revascularization procedure, or who died on admission, were excluded. The strategy was invasive in 73 patients (70%). Five of them died before angiography could be performed and 65 underwent angioplasty (success rate 72%). By univariate analysis the invasive strategy was associated with a lower mortality than conservative strategy (71% vs 91%, p = 0.03), but this association disappeared after adjustment for baseline characteristics. Older age, nonsmoking, and previous ischemic heart disease were independent predictors of mortality. In conclusion, we have failed to demonstrate that a strategy of urgent coronary revascularization within 24 hours of symptom onset for patients with AMI complicated by cardiogenic shock is independently associated with a lower in-hospital mortality. This strategy was limited by the high mortality within 1 hour of admission in patients with cardiogenic shock, the modest success rate of angioplasty in this setting, and the powerful influence of some adverse baseline characteristics on prognosis.",,N Pérez-Castellano;E García;J A Serrano;J Elízaga;J Soriano;M Abeytua;J Botas;R Rubio;E López de Sá;J L López-Sendón;J L Delcán

The data are daily numbers of myocardial infarction incidence rates (15,543 cases) and number of deaths for infarction (3,065 cases), abstracted from registries of the 14 biggest hospitals of St. Petersburg (1989-1990). The analysis showed a statistically significant increase in myocardial infarction rate during big geomagnetic disturbances, defined by the days of the descending phase of cosmic ray Forbush decreases. An overall estimation of the average increase in infarction incidence rate during big geomagnetic storms, (10.5 +/- 1.2)%, has been computed by taking into account previous results [1-3]. In contrast, morbidity data did not show any significant correlation with geomagnetic disturbances. It was found also that the infarction incidence rate appears to be rather constant from Monday to Friday and to decrease sharply by a factor approximately 1.25 on Saturday-Sunday and mid-week festivities. This effect is associated with different exposure during work days and week-ends to man-made magnetic field environment mainly produced by electrified transport. Such effect was not observed in mortality data. The results and their methodological aspects are placed in the context of studies on possible health effects of low frequency magnetic fields both natural and man-made origin.",,G Villoresi;N G Ptitsyna;M I Tiasto;N Iucci

Their mean age (62) corresponded to the mean age of all acute myocardial infarction patients (63). 28 (25%) survived the hospitalization and were followed after discharge. 2 were lost to follow-up. After a mean follow-up period of 26 months, 8 patients had died and 18 were still alive, none of them free of symptoms. There was no difference of age, duration of respirator therapy and maximal creatine kinase activity between survivors (group A) and nonsurvivors (group B). In 50% of patients cardiac failure leading to endotracheal intubation was triggered or made worse by arrhythmias. The remaining 50% of patients showed pure pump failure. Again in these two subsets, cardiac failure was significantly less marked in group A than in group B according to the hemodynamic findings. In conclusion, inpatient mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction requiring artificial ventilation was high (75%) and hemodynamic findings were significantly worse in those not surviving. Patients discharged from the hospital also had a reduced life expectancy (less than 50% after 3 years).",,K Speiser;P C Baumann

During this period the percentage of patients who had acute active interventions (thrombolysis, aortocoronary bypass surgery, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) increased from 6% (in 1978/79) to 50% (in 1986/87). During that same period, conventional treatment of acute myocardial infarction and the provisions for emergency admission and intensive care remained unchanged. At the same time there was a significant reduction in overall mortality from 29% (1978/79) to 17% (1986/87) (P less than 0.001). This decrease was especially marked for males (from 27% to 13% in the respective periods), and in patients with anterior-wall infarction (34% and 16%, respectively).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12522527/,Peripartum acute myocardial infarction: management perspective,"Acute myocardial infarction in pregnancy and puerperium is an uncommon event with substantial morbidity and mortality rates. Atherosclerosis may be the cause, but often the coronary arteries are healthy at angiography. In such cases, the suggested mechanism is a decreased coronary perfusion related to coronary spasm or in situ thrombosis. Most pregnant women who died after myocardial infarction did so at the time of initial infarction, and maternal mortality was greatest if the infarction was late in pregnancy. Increasing cardiovascular stresses of late pregnancy, especially when intensified by parturition, seriously compromise women with ischemic heart disease. Therefore, there should be efforts to limit myocardial oxygen demand throughout pregnancy, and particularly during parturition. It is important for diagnosis to have increased awareness of its possible occurrence. Although principles of management can be generalized, it is necessary to provide individualized care for these high-risk patients by a multidisciplinary team of cardiologists, anesthesiologists, and obstetricians.",,Vithaya Chaithiraphan;Ramesh M Gowda;Ijaz A Khan;Carl D Reimers

With regard to acute ischemic heart disease, this phenomenon is due mainly to the availability of large databases that in an ordered and predefined manner collect patient ECG patterns along side their clinical and coronary angiography details as well as outcome data. The present review critically analyses the diagnostic role of standard ECG in acute coronary syndromes with or without ST-segment elevation (STEMI and NSTEMI, respectively) and focuses on interpretation pitfalls and patterns that can contribute to therapeutic decision-making. In front of a patient with a clinical presentation suggestive of acute myocardial infarction the ECG can help answer many questions. In case a STEMI is suspected: are we sure we can exclude an infarction? (the problem of false negatives); are we sure it is a real infarction and not a false positive? Which is the obstructed coronary artery and at what level? Has there been reperfusion? In case an NSTEMI is suspected: are we sure it is a real myocardial infarction, rather than a pulmonary embolism or an aortic dissection? Are we sure it is NSTEMI rather than a ""masked"" dorsal STEMI? Which coronary substrate and what ischemia extension can we hypothesize in this patient?

Myocardial infarction mortality in the Clinical Hospital Split in the seven years period between 2000 and 2006, have been analyzed together with out of hospital sudden death patients with acute myocardial infarction established during autopsy. During the seven year period between 2000 and 2006, 3434 patients were treated for myocardial infarction in the Split Clinical Hospital, 2336 (68%) males and 1098 (32%) females with a 12% total mortality (427 patients). The annual number of hospitalized persons has been increasing during that period (474 in yr. 2000 us. 547 in yr. 2006), while mortality decreased from 15% in 2000 to 9.6% in 2006. Female patients had significantly higher hospital mortality than male patients, (228 or 21% vs. 202 or 9%, p<0.05). Women also had significantly higher total AMI mortality (23.7% vs. 15,7%, p <0.05). Anterior myocardial infarction with ST elevation in precordial leads had significantly higher mortality (19%) compared to patients with lateral (11%), inferior (10%) myocardial infarction with ST elevation and also NSTEMI (4%) mortality p<0.05. Female patients more frequently die in hospital, 84% (230) than out of hospital 16% (43). From the total number of AMI deaths (388) in male patients, 56% (217) were in hospital and 44% (171) out of hospital (p<0.001). Men had significantly higher prehospital mortality rate than women (81% vs. 19%, p<0.05). Men also more frequently died from ventricular fibrillation (22% vs. 10%, p<0.05), while women died more frequently of heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and myocardial rupture (33% vs. 15% p<0.05). Regarding the total number of deaths from myocardial infarction men had significantly higher prehospital mortality compared to women (178 or 7.3% vs. 43 or 3.7%, p<0.05). Anterior myocardial infarction had a significantly higher rate in patients dying pre-hospital (58%), in contrast to inferior (36%) and lateral myocardial infarction with ST elevation (6%) p<0.05.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8198386/,The earliest diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction,"Acute myocardial infarction results from the cessation of myocardial blood flow caused by thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery. Rapid restoration of blood flow to the ischemic myocardium minimizes cardiac damage and improves early and long-term morbidity and mortality. Chest pain is the first symptom of myocardial infarction, but in some patients with silent ischemia, the disease can be diagnosed only in retrospect. In symptomatic patients, myocardial infarction should be accurately and promptly diagnosed so that reperfusion therapy can begin immediately. Electrocardiography is the simplest diagnostic modality. Although regional ST-segment elevation is specific, it is not sensitive. In contrast, new computerized algorithms for electrocardiographic analysis and serial monitoring increase sensitivity without decreasing specificity. In the emergency room, echocardiography is used to diagnose patients with no prior history of coronary artery disease whose electrocardiograms proved nondiagnostic. Time-consuming perfusion nuclear studies are inferior to echocardiography but may nevertheless enable physicians to diagnose myocardial infarction in the emergency room. Although the presence of excess creatine kinase is a sign of myocardial necrosis, its increase is delayed for a few hours after coronary occlusion. Doctors can diagnose myocardial infarction as early as two hours after coronary occlusion with the help of simpler automatic assays of MB-creatine kinase mass that use monoclonal antibodies. Other investigational markers of myocardial necrosis include myoglobin and troponin. Elevation of a circulating protein marker also signifies established necrosis, but physicians hope to achieve reperfusion through therapy before irreversible damage occurs.",,Y Rozenman;M S Gotsman

Concave inflections of the QRS loop, defined as ""bites,"" were best delineated when the loop was viewed from a left cranial or right caudal direction. Bites appeared 48 +/- 8 minutes after LAD ligation in all of the dogs, and their development was closely related to the temporal changes in the % sigma R and QRS point score on a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram. Q waves were not observed on the electrocardiograms in 9 dogs. In the remaining 9, they appeared 117 +/- 18 minutes after LAD ligation. The bite duration, area, and amplitude were compared with the anatomical extent of the infarcts. A significant positive correlation was found between bite duration and infarct size.

Some authors have found an independent prognostic value of complex ventricular arrhythmias, while others consider that ventricular arrhythmias predict future cardiac events only if associated with low ejection fractions. Other factors that have 1-year prognostic value are the following: a previous MI, a history of angina at least 3 months preceding the infarct, postmyocardial angina, and the criteria that indicate to the practitioner whether MI patients are medically ineligible for stress testing. There still remain controversies in regard to the predictive value of certain variables such as the site, type, and extension of the MI, the presence of complex ventricular arrhythmias, exercise-induced hypotension, ST segment elevation, and the electrical provocation of dangerous arrhythmias.",,S Robichaud-Ekstrand

Electrocardiographic and coronarographic data],"The topographical and physiopathological aspects of the danger of extension of infarction of the myocardium are defined with the aid of data collected by electrocardiogram and coronarography in 50 patients. The danger of extension in situ, observed in 64% of the cases, is the most frequent and complicates particularly the progression of anterior infarcts. In fact, it is located in the same area as the initial infarct in 91% of the cases for anterior infarcts and in 40% of the cases for inferior infarcts. It is expressed by an elevation of the ST segment in 84% of the cases and corresponds to a monotruncular attack in 63% of the cases. The downstream bed of the vessel destined for the infarcted area and threatened secondarily remains permeable in the anterograde sense. Apart from infarcts, the danger of extension is less frequent, found in 36% of the cases, and complicates preferentially the progression of inferior infarcts. It finds expression in a depression of the ST segment in 77% of the cases and the coronary attack is always pluritruncular. The mortality in one month is 35% of 17 patients treated medically and 3% of 33 patients who have been equipped with a shunt or angioplasty. In situ the danger of extension denotes the presence of cellular islets, which are still healthy, in the region of an infarcted myocardial zone, the viability of which may be threatened secondarily by a phenomenon of coronary occlusion, which is intermittent and repeated. Except for an infarct, the danger of extension implies the diffusion of an atheromatous effect.

Lazarus's stress-coping theory was used as a framework for the study. A sample of 30 MI subjects were interviewed before discharge and during early convalescence. Before discharge, subjects rated six out of the seven content areas as ""important"" for learning. Although the information was considered important, it was not rated as equally realistic to learn. During early convalescence, mean scores under 'important to learn' were slightly lower, but all seven content areas were rated as significantly more realistic to be learned (P less than 0.05). Little variation in patients' perceptions of the importance of teaching content was noted over time. However, there was major variation between their perceptions of how important and how realistic it was to learn the material before discharge.

Fifty-nine patients (81%) had coronary reflow sufficient to control pain and injury current: 52 received thrombolysis alone and seven had thrombolysis combined with acute coronary angioplasty. Recurrent ischemic events in hospital were frequent and occurred in 17 patients (29%). These included silent reocclusion (four patients), recurrent angina (eight patients), and recurrent infarction in the same myocardial zone (five patients). Late ischemic events occurred in 11 patients (19%) and included silent reocclusion (two patients) and angina (nine patients). Although acute coronary angioplasty resulted in a high rate of successful myocardial reperfusion, long-term vessel patency was infrequent. The results of coronary bypass surgery, performed in hospital for severe residual coronary stenosis and angina and later for recurrent angina, were uniformly good. At follow-up of 6 to 36 months (mean 18.5 +/- 8.1), total mortality was five patients (8%). Only 16 reperfused patients (27%) were alive and well without recurrent ischemia or interventions. We conclude that reopening an acutely occluded coronary artery by thrombolysis and/or angioplasty can be performed in the majority of patients but must be regarded as initial therapy in view of the high incidence of recurrent ischemic events.

It has been reported that subclinical hyperthyroidism is not associated with coronary heart disease or mortality from cardiovascular causes but it is sufficient to induce arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Nowadays, there is growing interest regarding endogenous sublinical hyperthyroidism and the cardiovascular system. We present a case of acute myocardial infarction without significant coronary stenoses in a 75-year-old Italian woman with endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism.

As DO2 declined due to low cardiac output, a significant decrease in VO2 (r = 0.75, p less than 0.001) and a significant increase in P50 (r = -0.74, p less than 0.001) were observed. In the DO2 range between 300 and 450 ml/min/m2, in which the DO2 of 32 survivors and 11 nonsurvivors overlapped, the P50 of nonsurvivors was significantly higher than that of survivors (31.5 +/- 1.6 vs 27.9 +/- 1.5 torr, p less than 0.001), but there were no significant differences in any other oxygen transport variable. As a result of differences in P50, VO2 in this range was significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared to survivors (169 +/- 17 vs 148 +/- 13 ml/min/m2, p less than 0.001). These data suggest that a normal or increased VO2 alone does not ensure survival in patients with acute myocardial infarction, and increased P50 leads to an increase in VO2. Nevertheless, the interpretation of an increased P50 in patients with acute myocardial infarction must be made with caution, even with adequate DO2 and VO2, because it may imply a precarious oxygen transport/requirement balance in peripheral tissue and, hence, a fatal outcome.",,T Sumimoto;Y Takayama;T Iwasaka;T Sugiura;M Takeuchi;N Tarumi;H Takashima;M Inada

One hundred forty-one patients (70%) had evidence of a Q-wave AMI within 3 hours of the initiation of thrombolytic therapy, 31 (16%) developed Q waves after 3 hours but before hospital discharge, and 29 (14%) were discharged with a non-Q-wave AMI. Laboratory indicators of myocardial damage and in-hospital morbidity and mortality were greater among patients with Q-wave AMIs than with non-Q-wave AMIs. When these indexes were examined with respect to the timing of Q-wave evolution, the prognosis of patients with delayed Q-wave development was similar to that of patients with non-Q-wave AMIs. Thus, compared to patients with early (less than or equal to 3 hours) Q-wave evolution, patients with delayed Q-wave evolution or with a non-Q-wave AMI had a smaller creatine kinase peak (mean 661 to 1,081 vs 1,251 to 1,541 IU; p = 0.005), better preservation of left ventricular function as measured by radionuclide ventriculography before discharge (mean +/- standard deviation 54 +/- 11% vs 47 +/- 13%; p less than 0.01), and a lower incidence of congestive heart failure at discharge (3 vs 15%; p = 0.02).

All successfully operated animals were decapitated at 96th h after the intervention. The serial histological heart slices to full coverage of the myocardial lesion revealed intramural infarctions in both the control and experimental rats, the former having been subjected to only a 10 min occlusion of the coronary artery and the latter having been treated with Propranolol or Dipyridamole. The myocardial lesions were invisible to the naked eye. They consisted of a necrotic center and a large reactive zone of mononuclear cells. The severity of the experimental disease was expressed by indices of myocardial lesions, based on the objective estimation of the infarct dimension. Propranolol (20 mg/kg, ip) or Dipyridamol (20 mg/kg, ip) applied to rats with induced myocardial infarction minished significantly the indice, of myocardial lesion. The high correlation coefficients of this indication, calculated at intervals between the slices of 0.1 to 0.4 mm, allowed the indices to be determined by a smaller number of slices-thus the work is being simplified.

The patients who were given grafts generally had a smaller infarction with less functional impairment than the 476 patients who were not. The outcome of coronary artery bypass grafting was investigated in a retrospective matched pair study. Patients were matched on the basis of the presence of postinfarction angina, left ventricular ejection fraction, location of the infarction, peak creatine kinase activity, Killip clinical class, and severity of coronary disease with 34 patients who were given medical treatment only. At one year follow up fewer of the operated patients had symptoms than did the matched non-operated patients. Survival at one year in the operated and non-operated groups respectively was 94% vs 91%; angina within one year occurred in 3% vs 68%; congestive heart failure in 3% vs 6%; and 0% vs 32% were referred for later bypass grafting or coronary angioplasty.

In 26 out of 27 consecutive patients without clinical signs of disturbed myocardial function, normal hemodynamic values were also found invasively. In 43 patients, depressed myocardial function was diagnosed on the basis of the clinical findings. These findings were verified in 38 patients (88%) by means of cardiac catheterization; 5 patients (12%) had normal hemodynamic values. In 26 patients with clinical signs of congestive heart failure, an attempt was made to identify non-invasively those with a low output (cardiac index less than 2/min/m2). Only 3 of the 6 patients with a low output could be identified by clinical examination alone. In one patient a low output was clinically diagnosed despite normal cardiac function measured invasively. In 16 patients, 48 subsequent clinical examinations were performed during treatment of congestive heart failure to identify either persistent elevated left ventricular filling pressure or low output; 15 (31%) were found to be incorrect when compared with the cardiac catheterization data. Patients with acute myocardial infarction and normal ventricular function can be identified with high accuracy by means of clinical examination alone. The clinical diagnosis of congestive heart failure was incorrect in 12% of the patients. A low output state in acute myocardial infarction is often overlooked in clinical examination alone. Of the clinical examinations on patients during therapy, 30% were incorrect. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring in acute myocardial infarction therefore appears to be unnecessary in patients with normal clinical findings, but in those with clinically diagnosed congestive heart failure it is mandatory for precise indication and evaluation of therapy.",,O Bertel;G Baitsch;A M Steiner;F Burkart;R Ritz

The occluded or the narrowest segments of the coronary arteries were examined at intervals of 100 mu using serial sections. Serial sectioning is important in such a study because the pathology of the lumen can vary considerably within a 2 to 3 mm segment. A high incidence (80.3%) of thrombus formation corresponding to the site of infarction was observed. These thrombi occluded the vessel lumen, were usually found proximally in the coronary arteries, and were associated with a ruptured atheromatous plaque in 90.8 per cent of cases. It is postulated that an increase of intraplaque pressure resulting from a honeycomb-like accumulation of foam cells, cholesterol clefts, and blood infiltration through the injured endothelial cells is the cause of rupture of the atheromatous plaque. This rupture into the vessel lumen may precede, and be responsible for, formation of thrombus and the onset of acute myocardial infarction.",,T Horie;M Sekiguchi;K Hirosawa

Fourteen (14%) patients (group A) developed ventricular fibrillation (VF) at the time of pacing catheter manipulation in the right ventricle. Compared to the remaining 87 (86%) patients (group B), the patients in group A were younger (56.1 vs 65.8 yrs, P = 0.007). Thirteen (92.8%) of 14 patients in group A had inferior MI compared to 58 (66.6%) of 87 patients in group B (P = 0.04).

In 12 of the 14 patients in group A, following defibrillation and intravenous bolus administration of lidocaine, the pacing catheter was positioned in the right ventricle without further episodes of VF. It is concluded that 1) in patients with acute MI temporary transvenous pacemaker insertion may be complicated by VF; 2) VF is most likely to occur in younger patients with inferior MI infarction when the pacing catheter is inserted within 24 h of the onset of symptoms of infarction; and 3) administration of an intravenous bolus of lidocaine may be effective in preventing the induction of VF by catheter manipulation.",,A N Mooss;W B Ross;D J Esterbrooks;C Nair;S Mohiuddin;M H Sketch

Scores of fundraising appearances for the Missouri Heart Association during the 1950s and 1960s throughout the 1,000,000 population rural/urban Southwest Missouri region gave an ideal setting for teaching the public the early symptoms of heart attack. Audiences were advised that if any of these appeared they should immediately call their doctor or quickly get to the nearest hospital emergency room. These presentations led to a steady increase in hospital admissions. The Missouri Heart Association responded by launching the Early Warning Signs of Heart Attack Public and Professional Education Program in July 1971, incorporating these messages in radio, TV, and newspaper Public Service Announcements. In less than 6 months, analysis of consecutive admissions to the cardiovascular intensive care unit of the base hospital showed that the median time from the onset of symptoms to starting to the hospital was reduced from 4 to 2.2 hours; 64% of those patients called their doctor as their first step in seeking help and 58% went to the hospital by car.

The choice of a suitable criterion for diagnosis of Coxsackie infection is discussed fully. Two hundred and fifty admissions to a Coronary Care Unit and 100 control subjects had a serum sample tested by microneutralisation for Coxsackie B antibodies. The incidence of infection among 130 patients diagnosed as acute myocardial infarction was 5% compared with 4% in the control group. In a subgroup classified as non-transmural myocardial infarction, the incidence of infection was 14%. The sex ratio of this group differed from the myocardial infarction group as a whole suggesting that the non-transmural group may not have been homogeneous. Normal coronary arteriograms were subsequently found in three patients who were diagnosed as non-transmural myocardial infarction but who had serological evidence of recent Coxsackie infection. This study does not demonstrate an association between Coxsackie infection and myocardial infarction as a whole and does not support the view that Coxsackie infection causes or provokes myocardial infarction.

Moreover, some studies have suggested improvement of cardiac function. Its mechanism of action, initially attributed to blood flow from the ventricular cavity through the channels toward the ischaemic myocardium, remains to be defined. 21 pigs were randomised to TMLR of the left lateral wall (TMLR group; n = 7), to myocardial infarction (MI group; n = 7), or to both (TMLR-MI group; n = 7). In each group one animal was sacrificed at postoperative day 0, 7, 14 and 21, and 3 animals at postoperative day 28. The lateral wall of the left ventricle was fixed in 4% formaldehyde and sliced in a plane perpendicular to the channels for histological analysis. The evolution of the cross-section area of the lesions as well as their vascular densities at postoperative day 28, expressed as number vascular structures per mm2, were studied. All the channels were occluded by a clot at postoperative day 0 and by scar tissue at postoperative day 28. The cross-section area of the lesions diminished from 8.1 +/- 1.3 mm2 at postoperative day 0 to 2.4 +/- 0.2 mm2 at postoperative day 28. At postoperative day 28, the vascular density of scar tissue of the channels in the TMLR group was significantly increased in comparison with that of myocardial infarction in the MI group (47.1 +/- 10.2 vs. 23.8 +/- 9.1; p < 0.01). In the TMLR-MI group, channels scar became indistinguishable from surrounding myocardial infarction scar. In this model, laser channels are occluded early and do not salvage acute ischaemic myocardium. Mechanisms which could explain clinical improvement, as suggested by the results, are intense laser-induced neovascularisation and channel scar retraction (Laplace's law).",,X M Mueller;H T Tevaearai;P Chaubert;C Y Genton;L K von Segesser

Therefore, first cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging using delayed enhancement (DE) was performed and revealed a transmural inferior wall myocardial infarction of LV with extensive involvement of RV. This case illustrates the difficulties of conventional imaging modalities and invasive coronary angiography to depict an inferior myocardial infarction with RV involvement.",,Robert Manka;Eckart Fleck;Ingo Paetsch

The electrocardiographic pattern was characterized by the development of various rhythm and conductivity disorders, PQ (S-TP) segment shift, longer duration of the P wave, changes in its morphology, increase in the Macrus index. The electrocardiographic signs were demonstrated most comprehensively in cases of transmural lesions and with approximately the same rate on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd day of the lesion.",,D Iu Khodzhaeva;L T Dubinina

In this study it was of interest whether there is any beneficial influence of ischemic preconditioning on 30-day in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing acute Q-wave myocardial infarction. All men and women admitted to our ward between December 1994 and July 1996 with their first acute Q-wave myocardial infarction were divided into two groups. I group--29 patients with prodromal angina, defined as chest pain episodes in the 24-hour period before myocardial infarction. II group--25 patients who showed no chest pain before infarction onset. Both groups did not differ statistically in view of age, sex, smoking habits and adjunctive therapy. The use of streptokinase in the I and II group was also similar--in 58.6% and 56% of patients respectively in the first and second group. In the I group there was no fatal outcome, all 5 death cases occurred in the II group. The results are statistically significant and suggest lower in-hospital mortality in Q-wave myocardial infarction patients with previous ischaemic preconditioning.",,K Stoch

The area under myocardial infarction was shown to be dependent on the site of the atherosclerotic process rather than the degree of stenosis in patients with isolated coronary arterial lesions. A relationship was established between the incidence of complications developing in the acute phase of infarction and the degree of stenosis. The disease was complicated more frequently in patients with coronary arterial occlusion as compared to those with severe coronary-arterial stenosis. High stress tolerance, irrespective of the site of myocardial infarction, is an evidence of great functional potentials in this category of patients.",,A P Golikov;S P Levshunov;G E Belozerov

Each patient underwent 16 lead precordial electrocardiographic mapping before, during, and after exercise and in addition coronary arteriography was performed. There was no significant difference in the extent of coronary disease or abnormalities of left ventricular function between patients with exercise induced ST segment elevation that was noted to occur in leads with Q waves and those with ST segment elevation plus depression or those with ST segment depression alone. Patients without exercise induced ST segment changes had fewer coronary arteries involved than those who developed ST segment changes. Nineteen patients with exercise induced ST segment elevation alone underwent coronary artery bypass surgery; in 11 this resulted in complete abolition of the exercise induced ST segment elevation and was associated with symptomatic relief and patent grafts without alteration of left ventricular function. Thus, exercise induced ST segment elevation in patients with previous myocardial infarction should be considered as important as ST segment depression in terms of underlying myocardial ischaemia, coronary anatomy, and left ventricular function.",,K M Fox;A Jonathan;A Selwyn

Thrombolysis was initiated in 22 patients and followed by a coronary angiogram 90 min later. In 13 patients the infarct-related artery was then patent (THR group). In nine patients the infarct-related artery was occluded and rescue percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed (group THR+rPTCA). In 12 patients, primary PTCA was carried out (pPTCA group). Admission values of vWF were similarly high in the three groups, while changes in vWF over the following days were statistically different among the groups. No significant change was observed in THR, whereas a significant and prolonged increase was found after failed thrombolysis with PTCA (peak increase at day 5:1.54 +/- 0.04 U.ml-1). In the pPTCA group, a significant increase could only be found on day 3 (0.96 +/- 0.04 U.ml-1). Absence of a statistical rise in vWF might be a late indicator of successful thrombolysis. The prolonged increase in vWF after failed thrombolysis needing rescue PTCA probably reflects a higher resistance to thrombolysis, while the slight but significant increase in vWF following primary PTCA could be due to vascular injury.",,P Soskin;J M Mossard;R Arbogast;M L Wiesel;L Grunebaum;G Roul;P Bareiss;M E Moulichon;J P Cazenave;A Sacrez
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18178398/,Comparison of left ventricular ejection fraction and inducible ventricular tachycardia in ST-elevation myocardial infarction treated by primary angioplasty versus thrombolysis,"Electrophysiologic studies predict the risk for sudden death after myocardial infarction (MI). Although primary angioplasty has become the preferred method of treatment for ST-elevation MI, intravenous thrombolysis remains the first-line treatment in 30% to 70% of cases worldwide. Rates of ventricular tachyarrhythmias may vary according to type of reperfusion treatment. This study was undertaken to examine the hypothesis that the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and rates of inducible ventricular tachycardia may be more favorable in treatment with primary angioplasty rather than thrombolysis. Consecutive patients receiving primary angioplasty (n = 225) or thrombolysis (n = 195) for ST-elevation MI were included. The mean LVEF was 48 +/- 12% for the primary angioplasty group and 46 +/- 13% for the thrombolysis group (p = 0.30). The proportion of patients with LVEFs <40% was 30% in the primary angioplasty group and 30% in the thrombolysis group (p = 0.98). Patients with LVEFs <40% underwent electrophysiologic studies. Ventricular tachycardia was inducible in 23 of 66 primary angioplasty patients (34.8%) compared with 21 of 55 (38.1%) thrombolysis patients (p = 0.69). Implantable cardiac defibrillators were inserted in 30 patients, of whom 8 (27%) had appropriate device activations. The mean time from MI to first spontaneous activation was 387 +/- 458 days. In conclusion, patients treated with thrombolysis or primary angioplasty for ST-elevation MIs had similar resultant LVEFs and rates of inducible ventricular tachycardia. There was a surprisingly high rate of spontaneous defibrillator activations, often occurring late after MI.",,James J H Chong;Anand N Ganesan;Vicki Eipper;Pramesh Kovoor
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8737209/,Myocardial contrast echocardiography in acute myocardial infarction. Pathophysiological background and clinical applications,"Myocardial contrast echocardiography is a technique used in experimental and clinical settings in order to visualize the pattern of intramyocardial perfusion. In the acute phase of myocardial infarction, regional absence of flow during myocardial contrast echocardiography delineates the area at risk of necrosis, while the definitive non-perfused area expresses infarct size. Reopening the infarct-related artery, which may be achieved spontaneously by thrombolysis or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, is not a reliable indicator of intramyocardial reperfusion. If myocardial ischaemia due to coronary occlusion has been sufficiently prolonged and severe, not only myocyte viability, but also microvascular integrity is lost. Myocardial contrast echocardiography, using intracoronary injection of sonicated contrast medium, gives information about microvascular integrity and the effective presence of intramyocardial reflow. Anatomical integrity of microvasculature does not necessarily imply preserved function, and thus the microvessel vasodilating reserve may also be impaired. Myocardial contrast echocardiography has the potential to assess alterations in microvascular function, showing, in the myocardial area with reduced coronary reserve, a relatively reduced increase in echocontrast signal intensity when an intravenous vasodilator agent is administered.",,S Iliceto;V Marangelli;A Marchese;A Amico;L Galiuto;P Rizzon

In survivors after myocardial infarction, reduced 24-hour HRV, is an independent predictor of mortality/sudden cardiac death. The attenuated HRV is presumed to indicate reduced vagal function and concomitant high sympathetic activity. In experimental studies, this combination reduces the threshold for inducing malignant tachyarrhythmias, and is very probably a clinically important factor for the evolution of ventricular arrhythmias.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8590749/,Rehabilitation in the patient after myocardial infarction with or without surgical management,"Cardiac rehabilitation has evolved into a composite therapy of exercise training, psychosocial support, and education with major goals of returning patients to normalcy after an acute coronary event such as myocardial infarction or coronary bypass surgery. This process seems especially important in patients with significant levels of deconditioning before entering therapy. Survival is improved with a decrease in cardiovascular mortality after myocardial infarction of as much as 20% to 30%. Cardiac rehabilitation for the surgical patient today is additionally important with shortening length of stay, and with regard to the prevention of recurrent disease. Modification of risk factors in patients with known coronary disease has especially meaningful implications for the bypass patient. The percentage of patients returning for second, and even third coronary bypass operations continues to increase. Recent studies suggest the possibility of slowing, and in some cases actual arrest or regression of coronary atherosclerosis, in addition to the reduction of subsequent acute coronary events and the need for future revascularization. Other issues of potential importance include quality of life, return to work after bypass surgery, and noncardiac complications of surgery.",,F J Pashkow
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8279364/,Conjunctive antithrombotic therapy for thrombolysis in myocardial infarction,"Disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque in coronary arteries with a minor stenosis is the usual stimulus for acute coronary thrombosis and myocardial infarction. In this article the pathogenesis of arterial thrombosis and contributions of local arterial wall substrates, the rheology of blood flow, systemic factors, and the critical role of thrombin in the formation of thrombus are discussed. More potent antithrombotic therapy may accelerate exogenous thrombolysis, allows endogenous thrombolysis, and should reduce recurrent infarction and ischemia and death, as well as need for coronary revascularization. Maximal antithrombotic therapy for acute myocardial infarction includes an intravenous bolus of heparin at 100 U/kg followed by an intravenous infusion--at 1,200 U/hr for patients weighing 60-80 kg, 1,300 U/hr for those weighing > 80 kg, and 1,000 U/hr for those weighing < 60 kg (or 17 U/kg/hr)--to maintain the activated partial thromboplastin time at 2-3 times control (60-90 sec) for at least 5-7 days. To convert intravenous to subcutaneous administration, use 14,000-17,000 U every 12 hours and initially overlap the intravenous infusion by 2 hours. The loading dose of aspirin on admission to the hospital is 160 mg followed by 80 mg/day. High-risk patients should be considered for conversion of heparin to warfarin therapy for at least 3 months at an international normalized ratio of 2.5-4.0 for the prevention of recurrent ischemia, reinfarction, death, thromboembolism, reactivation of thrombosis, and reduced necessity for revascularization.",,J H Chesebro;J J Badimon;A F Ortiz;B J Meyer;V Fuster

In Group I, reperfusion was successful in 17 (Group Ia). It was unsuccessful in the other 10 (Group Ib). Patients' characteristics such as age, sex, infarct location, previous myocardial infarction, peak creatine kinase, and the extent of coronary artery disease were similar in Groups Ia and Ib. The in-hospital survival rate was significantly higher in Group Ia (76.5% vs 40.0%, p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the average hospital and CCU stays, total or maximal dosage of catecholamines (dopamine and dobutamine), and duration of IABP treatment of the discharged patients between Groups Ia and Ib. Cardiac index under pressure support (IABP, catecholamines, etc) in both Groups did not differ significantly. One patient in Group Ia had re-infarction. However, no patient in either group died during a mean follow-up period of 747 days. Among the surviving patients, 3 (23%) of Group Ia and all (100%) of Group Ib suffered from congestive heart failure. These findings suggested that reperfusion therapy improves the in-hospital survival rate in patients with cardiogenic shock.

There were 101 cardiac deaths, 71 (70%) of which were sudden (instantaneous or found dead). Multivariate analysis with log rank testing and the Cox proportional hazards model showed that end-systolic volume (chi 2 = 82.9) had greater predictive value for survival than end-diastolic volume (chi 2 = 59.0) or ejection fraction (chi 2 = 46.6), whereas stepwise analysis showed that once the relationship between survival and end-systolic volume had been fitted, there was no additional significant predictive information in either end-diastolic volume or ejection fraction. Severity of coronary occlusions and stenoses showed additional prediction of only borderline significance (p = .04 in one analysis), but continued cigarette smoking did remain an independent risk factor after stepwise analysis.

A resistance network model to calculate epicardial potentials from body surface electrocardiographic potentials was developed and used to examine the hypothesis in 219 patients with acute inferior myocardial infarction. In the learning set of 110 patients, two characteristic dipole patterns were observed, each associated with a high mortality rate in the ensuing 15 months when compared with that in the remaining patients. In the test set of 109 patients, a double-blind analysis of the patterns showed that the 34 patients with a dipole pattern had a collective mortality rate of 35% at 15 months compared with a 15 month rate of 5% in the remaining patients. In the total group of 219 patients, the magnitude of ST segment elevation and both the magnitude and integral of the area voltage of ST depression on the epicardium were significantly correlated with the mortality rate (p less than 0.0002 for all variables against death at 15 months).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/939423/,The initial manifestations of acute myocardinal infarction,"A review of 132 consecutive patients 65 years of age and older who had a myocardial infarction showed that two-thirds of them experienced pain at onset. Pain was the only symptom leading to bedside diagnosis in one-fourth of the patients. Pain at onset combined with sudden or increased dyspnea was present in one-fifth of the patients and pain associated with other symptoms in one-sixth. Dyspnea unaccompanied by pain heralded onset of infarction in one-fifth of the patients, and in almost 7 percent, onset was marked only by other symptoms. Cerebral symptoms dominated onset in one-tenth of the patients. Preexisting coronary heart disease, hypertension, or diabetes was not predictive of painless infarction. To avoid pitfalls and facilitate bedside diagnosis of infarction, physicians should be aware of the different clinical presentations of painless infarction in the aged, which occurred in over one-third of the patients in this cohort. They also should suspect the possibility of myocardial infarction in any patient in whom symptoms are not clear, even when they are mild and unobtrusive.

Experimental studies have suggested their usefulness in these areas. Clinical studies have demonstrated a role for beta-blockers in the hyperacute phase of MI, and in longterm treatment of infarct survivors.

A pericardial effusion was present in 44 patients and was absent in 141 patients. Electrocardiographic right ventricular infarction (> or = 1 mm of ST-segment elevation and Q wave in V4R) was detected in 54 patients, with 20 patients having pericardial effusion. Patients with pericardial effusion had significantly more left ventricular segments with advanced asynergy, lower cardiac output, higher pulmonary artery wedge pressure and higher incidence of right ventricular infarction than those without pericardial effusion. There were 17 in-hospital deaths. Although there was no significant difference in the mortality rate between patients with and without right ventricular infarction, a significantly higher hospital mortality rate was observed in patients with pericardial effusion compared to those without it (23 vs 5%). Pericardial effusion was selected with age and pulmonary artery wedge pressure as important variables associated with hospital mortality by the discriminant analysis. Patients who developed pericardial effusion, regardless of right ventricular infarction, had more extensive myocardial damage, and hence, pericardial effusion was one of the predictors of increased hospital mortality.",,T Sugiura;T Iwasaka;N Tarumi;K Takehana;Y Nagahama;M Inada

Assessment by magnetic resonance imaging,"Microvascular obstruction (MVO) is an important and independent determinant of post-infarct remodeling. Fifty-two patients with a successfully reperfused ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (MI) were studied with MRI in the first week and at 4 months post-infarction. On early (i.e., 2-5 min) post-contrast MRI, MVO was detected in 32 patients with an MVO to infarct ratio of 36.3 +/- 24.9%. On late (i.e., 10-25 min) post-contrast MRI, MVO was detected in only 27 patients, with an MVO to infarct ratio of 15.9 +/- 13.9%. MVO infarcts (n = 32) were associated with higher cardiac enzymes (troponin I, P = 0.016), and lower pre-revascularization thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow (P = 0.018) than non-MVO infarcts (n = 20). Infarct size was larger in MVO infarcts (25.0 +/- 14.3 g) than non-MVO infarcts (12.5 +/- 7.9 g), P = 0.0007. Systolic wall thickening in the infarct and peri-infarct area, and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) were worse in MVO (46.1 +/- 7.2%) than non-MVO infarcts (50.5 +/- 6.6%, P = 0.038). At 4 months, MVO infarcts showed more adverse remodeling and lack of functional improvement, whereas non-MVO infarcts improved significantly (LV EF at 4 months, MVO, 47.5 +/- 7.8%, P = 0.31; non-MVO, 55.2 +/- 10.3%, P = 0.0028). In the majority of patients with successfully reperfused ST-segment elevation MI, MVO is observed, whose present and maximal extent can be best evaluated on early post-contrast MRI. Presence of MVO is associated with more extensive infarctions, and characterized by greater adverse LV remodeling and lack of functional recovery.",,Jan Bogaert;Maria Kalantzi;Frank E Rademakers;Steven Dymarkowski;Stefan Janssens

The latter one is the negative T wave on the ECG computed similarly to the Z. L. Dolabchian's index for Q and R waves on days 1-2 and 28 of myocardial infarction. The use of the T parameter allows predicting the most frequently occurring complications during the hospital observation period and recurrent myocardial infarction and cardial death during the period indicated. In the acute stage, the magnitudes of the T parameter from 1 to 24 conventional units are predictors of the complications: lung edema, cardiogenic shock, rhythm disorders, myocardial infarction relapses, particularly in able-bodied men. If the T parameter amounts from 78 to 648 conventional units in the acute stage and on day 28, this suggests a high risk of repeated myocardial infarction and cardial death for one- and 4-year observation periods in accordance with materials of the ""Myocardial Infarction Register"" program in Novosibirsk.",,Iu P Nikitin;F F Liutova;L V Parulikova;S K Maliutina;T G Klimenkova;Iu L Marakasova

The major paradigm: ""Beyond TIMI 3 flow: the TIMI 4 or myocardial tissue-level perfusion""]","Treatment for ST- elevation acute coronary syndromes (acute myocardial infarction: AMI) has advanced rapidly in the last decade with major improvements in early fibrinolytic therapy (FT), primary percutaneous interventions (PCI) with the aid of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Recent interest has shifted from infarct related artery (IRA) patency to microvascular perfusion in the evaluation of patients with AMI. It is well known that establishing epicardial patency after AMI (TIMI 3 E) is not synonymous with tissue-level perfusion (TIMI 4M). Microvascular dysfunction due to the roles of platelet and inflammatory mediators in the no-reflow phenomenon occurs in a substantial proportion of patients despite thrombolytic therapy or PCI procedures. Techniques are now available that measure real tissue-level perfusion and also therapy is directed to optimize myocardial perfusion in patients with AMI. Despite advances, contemporary FT strategies with the combination of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors restore normal coronary flow (TIMI 3) in the IRA in only 50-75% and PCI achieves TIMI 3 flow rates in 90-95%, but only with modest reductions in mortality, but with significant reductions in rethrombosis of the IRA or stents, reinfarctions and in some patients with benefits in ventricular dysfunction. Therefore moving beyond the importance of TIMI 3 flow, the TIMI 4 flow, or improving tissue-level perfusion in the setting of AMI seems to be the paradigm for the treatment of ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes.",,Eulo Lupi-Herrera;Héctor González Pacheco;Ursulo Juárez Herrera;Eduardo Chuquiure;Gerardo Vieyra;Carlos Martínez Sánchez

In order to (1) determine if this procedure can detect regional ventricular asynergy in an unselected series of patients. (2) to determine whether the procedure can identify patients at high risk for cardiogenic shock, before the onset of hemodynamic deterioration and (3) to identify the inmmediate complications of acute myocardial infarction. For purposes of analysis of the present protocol, the ventricles were divided in a system of walls, segments and levels resulting in 22 potential regions. Technically satisfactory two-dimensional echocardiographic studies were obtained in 48 patients (90.56%). Of 1056 possible segments in the 48 patients all were deemed adequate for analysis. Akinesis was detected in 2 segments (0.18%), dyskinesis in 45 segments (4.26%), hypokinesis in 170 (16.09%), hyperkinesis 15 (1.42%) and normal 824 (78.03%). The more segments damaged were observed by two dimensional echo, the more clinical and hemodinamically compromised status of the patients was assessed.

The efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy, known for several years, has been questioned with the introduction of the concept of complete reperfusion, or TIMI III flow, much more frequently achieved with angioplasty. The systematic association of these techniques, with the intention of achieving a better rate of complete reperfusion, was soon abandoned, because this strategy did not improve the overall success rate, and was associated with more major cardiac events. Therefore, with regard the published data available, which does not include the new mechanical and pharmacological approaches, it seems that the relative efficacy of each method depends upon logistic conditions, and only a few well identified groups seem to do better with angioplasty, than with thrombolysis.

The infarctions occurred most often in the inferior wall, even when multiple vessels were grafted. Eleven patients with intraoperative infarction have had repeat postoperative coronary arteriograms. Seven had all grafts patent; three of these patients had hypokinesis of the infarcted wall. Four of the 11 patients had one or more occluded grafts; three of these patients had an area of hypokinesis. We conclude that intraoperative myocardial infarction is a common problem in aortocoronary bypass surgery and is not necessarily caused by graft occlusion.",,C T Fruehan;L W Johnson;J L Potts;H Smulyan;F B Parker Jr;R H Eich

Even the clinical terminology used to describe some of the various components of ACS have undergone change, while the latter term itself represents a fairly recent addition to the medical lexicon. Although there have been dramatic changes in the diagnostic and therapeutic interventions used and impressive declines in morbidity and mortality, the differential diagnosis and complications of AMI and ACS remain as challenging now as they were a half century ago.

Pericardial effusion was observed in 45 patients (33%), of whom 22 were followed until they recovered and were discharged. Pericardial effusion was more frequent in patients with anterior acute infarction than those with inferior acute infarction, and so it was in non-recanalized patients than in recanalized ones. Patients with pericardial effusion had higher peak levels of creatine kinase, higher wall motion score indices, and higher defect scores of thallium imagings. The improvement of regional wall motion at an infarct zone in patients with pericardial effusion was less regardless of the successful early recanalization. These results show that pericardial effusion is a common event in patients with acute myocardial infarction and observation of transition of pericardial effusion is important for predicting prognosis.",,A Takarada;H Kurogane;K Minamiji;T Yamasaki;T Mori;T Hayashi;M Terashima;Y Yoshida

Computer-assisted combined data analysis made use of image identification techniques, the images being based on a general approximation algorithm and informative coefficient.

Autopsy of animals at hourly and daily intervals demonstrated that treatment with allopurinol provided protection against the untoward pathophysiologic changes which attend this kind of experimental infarct. Allopurinol was anti-arrhythmic and caused improved myocardial repair accompanied by reduced fluctuations in circulating CPK, SGOT, SGPT, LDH, and myoglobin. Changes in blood lipids, glucose, and BUN suggests that allopurinol exerts some of its myocardial protective effects through its positive influence on protein metabolism.

All patients had complete occlusions of their proximal left anterior descending coronary arteries and were treated with intra-coronary thrombolytic therapy within 8 hours after the onset of their chest pain. The 43 patients were categorized in 4 groups based on the extent of their coronary collaterals in the early period of myocardial infarction and the results of thrombolysis. Group A consisted of 11 patients with well-developed collaterals who had successful thrombolysis. Group B was comprised of 14 patients with poorly developed or no collaterals, and successful thrombolysis. In group C, there were 9 patients with well-developed collaterals and unsuccessful thrombolysis. In group D, there were 9 patients who had poorly or not developed collaterals, and all had unsuccessful thrombolysis. Four weeks after the intervention, ejection fraction (EF) and regional wall motion (RWM) were calculated from the data of the left ventricular angiograms. There was no significant difference in patients' age, sex, nor in peak serum creatine kinase among the 4 groups or the duration of myocardial ischemia between groups A and B. Patients with successful thrombolysis (groups A and B) had significantly higher EF and preserved RWM of infarct areas compared to patients with unsuccessful thrombolysis (groups C and D, p less than 0.05). Thirteen patients with early reperfusion (within 4 hours after the onset of chest pain) had significantly higher EF and better RWM than did 12 patients with late reperfusion and 18 patients with unsuccessful thrombolysis (p less than 0.01). However, there was no significant correlation between the duration of myocardial ischemia and RWM of the infarct areas among 25 patients who had successful thrombolysis (r = -0.3, NS). Patients in group A had higher EF and better RWM of infarct areas than did patients in groups B, C and D (p less than 0.01). In addition, 3 patients with well-developed collaterals had good RWM despite late reperfusion which occurred more than 4 hours after the onset of symptoms. These results suggest that the extent of coronary collaterals during the early period of myocardial infarction and the time delay from the onset of symptoms to the initiation of thrombolytic therapy are important factors for the salvage of left ventricular function in patients with myocardial infarction.",,M Nakamura

Advances in pharmacological and mechanical reperfusion therapy have improved the survival of patients who experience myocardial infarction. Although revascularisation techniques have been shown to reduce infarct size and in-hospital mortality, patients recovering from myocardial infarction are still at increased risk for reinfarction, congestive heart failure, and sudden death. Despite impressive technological advances, lifestyle modification and pharmacological interventions remain the key components of secondary prevention after myocardial infarction. Although the concept of secondary prevention of reinfarction and death has been investigated vigorously for several decades, preventive therapy has been seriously underused by physicians.

Although coronary atherosclerosis is already established in patients who have had a myocardial infarction, evidence suggests that important reductions in recurrent coronary heart disease and death can be achieved through secondary prevention programs that modify risk factors. The high risk for recurrence and mortality in patients who survive a heart attack means that substantial reductions in the rates of these events can be achieved with relatively small reductions in risk factors. Patients who have had a myocardial infarction are also active participants in health care and are likely to be highly motivated to modify their risks for cardiac disease.",,D Siegel;D Grady;W S Browner;S B Hulley

We assessed the presence of late potentials in 37 patients within 5 hours of acute myocardial infarction onset and evaluated their disappearance or modification after reperfusion. Signal-averaged electrocardiogram, obtained computerizing QRS complexes filtered through Simson's bidirectional filter (25-250 Hz), was serially recorded in each patient: at admission, as well as 12 hours, 3 and 10 days following urokinase and/or heparin therapy. Other indirect markers of reperfusion (incidence of ventricular arrhythmias, serum CK-MB level, ST elevation) were contemporaneously evaluated. All patients underwent coronary angiography between 6 and 83 days after acute myocardial infarction. Late potentials (Total QRS greater than 115 ms; Under 40 microV greater than 39 ms; RMS Last 40 ms less than 25 microV) were present only in 25% of patients, and they always disappeared after successful thrombolysis. On the contrary if ischemia-related vessel occlusion persisted, late potentials persisted as well or else were first recorded on the 3rd or 10th day following acute myocardial infarction. Quantitative analysis of the ""averaged"" QRS complex showed a statistically significant reduction in QRS duration (-9.1 +/- 12.7 ms) 3 days after acute myocardial infarction in reperfused patients (group A, n = 24), while no significant reduction in the total QRS (-1 +/- 6.7 ms) was observed in non-reperfused cases (group B, n = 13), (p less than 0.05 group A vs group B). So, 10 ms reduction in total QRS duration was a good marker of reperfusion, with specificity = 92% and sensitivity = 54%; marker sensitivity was even higher (= 79%) when coupled with serum CK-MB peak within 12 hours of therapy (diagnostic accuracy = 84%). In conclusion, even if late potentials have a low prevalence in acute myocardial infarction (25%) their disappearance correlates with myocardial reperfusion. Furthermore, a reduction in total QRS duration greater than or equal to 10 ms can itself be a good marker of successful thrombolysis.",,E Occhetta;G Sarasso;L Rossi;A Magnani;L Bolognese;P Devecchi;P Rossi

In the United States, over 60% of acute MIs occur in patients 65 years of age or older, and approximately one third occur in persons over age 75. In addition, mortality rates following acute MI increase exponentially with age, such that approximately 60% of all MI deaths in the United States occur in the 6% of the population 75 years of age or older. The clinical features of acute MI vary by age. In particular, very elderly patients are less likely than younger patients to report chest pain. Conversely, confusion or altered mental status may be the presenting manifestation of acute MI in up to 20% of patients over 85 years of age. Older patients are also more likely to have ""silent"" or unrecognized MIs, as well as MIs without ST-segment elevation, compared with younger patients. Elderly patients with acute MI are more likely than younger patients to experience heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cardiac rupture, and shock, all of which are associated with increased mortality. Other factors contributing to the poor prognosis following acute MI in elderly individuals include a marked decline in cardiovascular reserve in the elderly, increased prevalence of comorbid conditions, underutilization of evidence-based therapies, and increased risk of iatrogenic complications.",,Michael W Rich

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23751328/,"Non-Q-wave myocardial infarction: comprehensive analysis of electrocardiogram, pathophysiology, and therapeutics","Since the invention of electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), its significance in the diagnosis of acute ischemic disease, chronic ischemic disease, and its contribution to cardiology has been no less than remarkable. The pathophysiology of acute coronary syndromes in most cases correlates with the clinical outcomes, biochemical findings (cardiac biomarkers), and electrocardiographic patterns. Electric activity in the myocardium is registered in the ECG describing positive deflections when the depolarization potential orientates positive charges to the recording electrode (approaches to it) and negative deflections when the depolarization potential orientates negative charges to the recording electrode and gets away from it. The abnormal Q-wave is the cornerstone of the myocardial infarction diagnosis after several days of the ischemic event. Findings in the ECG suggestive of ischemia and necrosis are ST elevation/depression and deep Q-waves, respectively, and the presence of a deep abnormal Q-wave in the ECG is evidence of necrotic areas and an inert myocardium, which is not capable to depolarize. Non-Q-wave myocardial infarction has been defined as acute myocardial infarction without a new-onset deep Q-wave on the ECG after day(s) of evolution, and because of the anatomopathological concept of infarction is usually related to necrosis, it results paradoxical to consider this widely known clinical and biochemical entity as a myocardial infarction when there is no evidence of necrosis in the ECG.",,Manuel Velasco;Edward Rojas

Antiplatelet therapy has no procoagulant effects, and its bleeding complications can easily be managed. Antithrombin therapy has rebound effects, for which no clear solution is available. Thrombolytic therapy has also procoagulant effects, which may interfere with coronary procedures in the early hours of acute myocardial infarction.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2680903/,Exercise and functional capacity after myocardial infarction,"This paper summarizes the literature on the effects of both inpatient and outpatient exercise programs on functional capacity in patients categorized as having mild, moderate, severe and very severe left ventricular damage after myocardial infarction (MI). Current evidence suggests that inpatient activities of daily living programs do not improve functional capacity as measured by a predischarge exercise stress test. In contrast, outpatient exercise training programs can improve functional capacity through augmentation of skeletal muscle arteriovenous oxygen difference (oxygen extraction) in nearly all patients with mild left ventricular damage, in most patients with moderate damage and in a few patients with severe damage. The recently developed conceptual model of functional capacity in post-MI patients presented in this paper underscores the need for assessment of the level of structural and functional impairment of the left ventricle before the nurse prescribes any type of exercise program. It also enables the nurse to begin to explain why post-MI patients differ in their response to exercise. Further research is needed, however, before the model can be used for predicting exercise outcomes in the clinical setting.",,A Folta;B L Metzger
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6158135/,Combined medical and surgical procedure in acute myocardial infarction--a preliminary report,"The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate a new therapeutic approach, by which acutely ischemic human myocardium could be reperfused. The procedure was as follows: intracoronary application of nitroglycerine, intraluminal recanalization by catheters and intracoronary application of streptokinase. Before and after these interventions coronary angiograms were made. Surgical coronary revascularization was performed 1--64 days after reestablishment of flow through the occluded vessels. Seven patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated in this manner. The mean preoperation ejection fraction was 48.6%, the mean enddiastolic pressure was 17.5 mmHg and the mean maximal CPK activity was 616 units/liter (u/l). By the conservative regimen outlined, reopening of the occluded vessels was achieved in all cases. Critical stenoses of 80--85%, however, persisted. But, reperfusion appeared sufficient since in none of the patients hemorrhagic myocarditis was produced intra-operatively. There was no hospital mortality. The mean post-operative ejection fraction was 60% and the mean enddiastolic pressure was 10.6 mmHg.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3904390/,Metoprolol in acute myocardial infarction. Development of myocardial infarction. The MIAMI Trial Research Group,"The effect of metoprolol on the development of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during days 0 to 3 and on late first and recurrent infarctions during days 4 to 15 has been investigated. Signs on electrocardiogram (ECG) were well balanced between the treatment groups at entry; 70% of patients had signs of suspected AMI and 19% of patients had normal ECGs. The remaining patients had abnormal ECGs but actual infarction could not be localized. The localization of suspected AMI was equivalently distributed in the 2 groups before randomization. Metoprolol altered the distribution of patients diagnosed during days 0 to 3 as having definite, possible or no AMI (p less than 0.02). In the placebo group, there were more patients with definite AMI (72.5% vs 70.5%) and less with possible AMI (5.6% vs 7.4) than in the metoprolol group. A larger proportion of patients developed a Q-wave infarction during days 0 to 3 in the placebo group (53.9%) compared with the metoprolol group (50.9%, p = 0.024). No difference in the effect of metoprolol regarding localization of the early AMI was observed. Late first myocardial infarction development (days 4 to 15) was observed in 20 patients (0.7%) in each group. Recurrent myocardial infarction tended to develop more frequently during days 4 to 15 in the placebo group compared with the metoprolol group (3.9% vs 3.0%, p = 0.08).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21714700/,Mean platelet volume/platelet count ratio as a predictor of long-term mortality after non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction,"Previous studies reported an association between elevated mean platelet volume (MPV) and post-myocardial infarction mortality. This study explores the association between long-term mortality after non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and the peripheral blood platelet indices (i.e., the mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet count, and the MPV/platelet (MPV/P) ratio). Two physicians independently reviewed the data of 619 NSTEMI patients. The blood samples were drawn and analyzed within 1 h of admission, the second, and the last hospital days. Patients were stratified into equal tertiles according to the platelet count, MPV, and MPV/platelet ratio. The primary outcome, 4-year all-cause mortality, was compared among the platelet indices tertile models. According to MPV, platelet count, and MPV/platelet ratio tertile models, there was a trend of higher 4-year mortality for the lower and upper tertiles in comparison to the middle tertiles. However, only the admission MPV/platelet ratio tercile model was statistically significant for predicting the 4-year mortality. The mortality rate of the highest MPV/platelet (48/207 (23%)) and the lowest (41/206 (20%)) tertiles were significantly higher than the middle tertile (19/206 (9%)), p = 0.0004 by the chi-squared test. After adjusting for Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events, the patients in the combined first and third MPV/P tertiles had higher mortality in reference to those in the middle MPV/P tercile (hazard ratio 1.951, confidence interval 1.032-3.687, and p < 0.0396). Our novel finding is that the MPV/platelet ratio is superior to the MPV alone in predicting long-term mortality after NSTEMI. We suggest that using this ratio will magnify any existing relationship between platelet indices and mortality post-NSTMI. Further studies are needed to confirm our finding.",,Basem Azab;Estelle Torbey;Jasvinder Singh;Meredith Akerman;Georges Khoueiry;Joseph T McGinn;Warren D Widmann;James Lafferty

Despite the initially favorable prognosis, however, long-term survival of patients after non-Q-wave infarction is similar to or even shorter than that after Q-wave infarction. It is now well documented that patients with non-Q-wave infarction are more prone to reinfarction, which usually occurs in the same area as the original injury. Since extensive damage from recurrent myocardial necrosis has a considerable deleterious effect on long-term survival, patients with non-Q-wave infarction would be expected to benefit from prophylactic treatment that prevents reinfarction. Indeed, this subset of patients appears to provide a unique opportunity to modify favorably the natural history of ischemic heart disease.",,R S Gibson

Although several criticisms soon followed this redefinition of acute MI, it was expected that these new criteria would substantially impact the clinical management and prognosis of patients with coronary artery disease. Important consequences on the health care system and government policies were supposed as well. However, 4 years later a substantial proportion of patients with acute MI are still diagnosed according to the old World Health Organization criteria, irrespective of the results of biomarker assays.

Holosystolic outward motion was characteristic of acute anterior infarction (93%) and acute subendocardial infarction (89%) but was less common in acute inferior infarction (29%). Partial systolic outward motion was seen in 8 of the 14 patients with acute inferior infarction, but only in 2 of 36 patients with acute anterior and subendocardial infarction. Cardiokymographic abnormalities were seen in more precordial locations in acute anterior (80%) and subendocardial infarction (97%) than in inferior infarction (74%). Holosystolic outward motion was seen in 75% of all locations in acute anterior and subendocardial infarction and only in 23% in acute inferior infarction. Thus both the extent and the severity of abnormal systolic outward motion clearly separated inferior infarction from anterior and subendocardial infarction.

Twenty-eight patients underwent primary stenting with coil stent. Follow-up coronary arteriography at 3 months and 1 year was planned in all patients. Procedural success was achieved in 96%. There was no acute or subacute thrombosis. Minimal lumen diameter (MLD) was increased from 0.08 +/- 0.19 to 2.73 +/- 0.49 mm after stenting. MLD had decreased significantly for 3 months (MLD at 3 months: 2.03 +/- 0.86 mm, p = 0.001). On the other hand, MLD did not differ between 3-month; and 1-year follow-up (MLD at 1 year: 2.26 +/- 0.73 mm, p = NS). Only one patient manifested reocclusion at 3-month follow-up. The cumulative restenosis rate and target lesion revascularization rate at 1-year follow-up were 25.9% (7/27) and 11.1% (3/27).

California Cardiology Working Group on Post-MI Management","Current management of patients after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) reflects a variety of approaches ranging from conservative to aggressive. Although each method is appropriate in certain subgroups, their application frequently lacks a scientific basis. Current, clinically relevant, evidence-based practice guidelines are needed for secondary prevention for survivors after an AMI. To meet this need, the California Cardiology Working Group was assembled to evaluate the available data from clinical trials and other published studies and develop evidence-based, cost-effective guidelines for clinicians to use as a basis for patient management after an AMI. The group consisted of 18 members, including cardiologists from academic institutions and physicians working in cardiac intensive care, private practices, and managed care settings, representing a broad spectrum of expertise pertaining to patients who have had an AMI. The members had expertise in cardiac intensive care, interventional cardiology, nuclear cardiology, lipid disorders, echocardiography, and cardiac rehabilitation. The intended audience for these practice guidelines includes all physicians who treat survivors of MI. A literature review of all relevant clinical trials and other published data about the natural history after AMI and the effects of current therapeutic modalities are discussed herein. Case histories served as models for application of the literature-based data. The recommendations for management were reached by consensus vote based on the scientific evidence.

How representative are autopsied subjects with this clinical entity?,"We documented the differences in clinical features between 86 autopsied and 54 nonautopsied subjects who died of myocardial infarction to ascertain any bias that might be present in use of postmortem data. More than 200 historical, clinical, noninvasive, and hemodynamic aspects were compared. Of noninvasive aspects examined in all subjects, only 13 had significant differences (by chi 2 or unpaired t tests) between autopsied and nonautopsied subjects. However, there had been greater impairment of vital signs and hemodynamic aspects during early hospitalization in the autopsied vs the nonautopsied subjects. Further, the one-month survival rate was lower in autopsied subjects (31% vs 72%; P less than .01). We conclude that patients in severe congestive heart failure or shock and, presumably, with relatively large or complicated myocardial infarcts are more likely to die early and be autopsied. Those with better cardiac function live longer, and often die after having been released from the initial hospitalization; these subjects, presumably with smaller and uncomplicated infarcts, do not undergo autopsy. Before correlating pathological and clinical data from subjects with acute myocardial infarction, it is important to carefully analyze bias inherent in the selection of subjects to undergo autopsy.",,W R Roeske;R M Savage;R O'Rourke;C M Bloor

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9183037/,Changing paradigms in thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction,"Acute myocardial infarction occurs when a ruptured coronary artery plaque causes sudden thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery and cessation of coronary artery blood flow. This paper reviews the underlying coronary pathology in progressive coronary atherosclerosis, mechanisms of plaque rupture and arterial occlusion and the time relationship between coronary occlusion and myocardial necrosis. Reperfusion can be achieved by chemical thrombolysis with different thrombolytic agents. Early lysis is achieved best by prehospital administration, a transtelephonic monitor, a mobile intensive care unit, active general practitioner treatment or by warning the emergency room of impending arrival of a patient. Thrombolytic therapy may be unsuccessful and not achieve Grade III TIMI flow in less than 4 h (or even 2 h) due to inadequate or intermittent perfusion or reocclusion. Adjuvant therapy includes aspirin and platelet receptor antagonists. Bleeding is a constant danger. Direct percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) may be as effective or better than chemical thrombolysis. Reperfusion protects the myocardium and salvages viable tissue. It also improves mechanical remodelling of the ventricle. Long-term follow-up has shown that quantum leaps of fresh coronary occlusion causes step-wise progression in patient disability and that further early, prompt reperfusion can salvage myocardium and prevent this inexorable progress of the disease.",,M S Gotsman;Y Rozenman;D Admon;M Mosseri;C Lotan;D Zahger;A T Weiss

Seventy-four patients fulfilled our criteria for thrombolysis, but only 35 patients received thrombolytic agents, whereas 39 were conservatively treated (controls). In 49 patients thrombolytic therapy was not indicated. Thrombolysis resulted in a non-significant reduction in the prevalence of exercise-induced ST-segment depression: 43% in reperfused patients versus 62% in controls. During 36-hour ambulatory ST-segment monitoring, however, the duration of myocardial ischaemia was significantly reduced in thrombolyzed patients: 322 minutes versus 1144 minutes in controls (p < 0.05). Exercise testing revealed a higher maximal work capacity in thrombolyzed patients compared with controls: 160 +/- 41 versus 139 +/- 34 W (p < 0.02). No difference was found in left ventricular ejection fraction between the two subgroups. We conclude, that thrombolysis given for a first AMI reduces residual myocardial ischaemia.

During their hospital stay, patients with nontransmural infarction had significantly less congestive heart failure and fewer intraventricular conduction defects than did patients with transmural anterior infarction; fewer atrial tachyarrhythmias and less sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular block than did patients with transmural inferior infarction; and an incidence of hypotension, pericarditis and ventricular irritability similar to that of patients in the other two groups. Patients with nontransmural infarction had a significantly lower coronary care unit mortality rate (9 percent) than that of patients with transmural anterior or transmural inferior infarction (20 and 19 percent, respectively). By 3 months, the mortality rate had risen to 14 percent in patients with nontransmural infarction, but was significantly higher (29 and 27 percent, respectively) in patients with transmural anterior or transmural inferior infarction. Angina was common in all three groups, occurring in more than 50 percent of patients during a mean follow-up period of 28.6 months after hospital discharge. In contrast, the incidence of subsequent myocardial infarction was significantly greater in patients with nontransmural myocardial infarction, occurring in 21 percent at 9 months compared with only 3 percent of patients with transmural anterior (p less than 0.01) and 2 percent of patients with transmural inferior (p less than 0.05) infarction.

Late mortality increased in patients with nontransmural myocardial infarction and, although this group had a significantly better survival rate at 3 months, the overall late mortality of the three groups was comparable.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2483234/,Effects of pharmacological treatment of acute myocardial infarction on left ventricular function,"Impairment of left ventricular function is a major consequence of acute myocardial infarction. Several interventions have been proposed to reduce the extent of myocardial tissue undergoing necrosis after cornoracy artery occlusion. Therapy for patients with acute myocardial infarction has long relied on interventions aimed at reducing oxygen consumption, such as administration of beta-blockers and nitrates. However, despite clinical evidence that these interventions can reduce mortality or prevent left ventricular dilatation, no clear benefit has been observed on left ventricular function. Over the past few years, treatment of acute myocardial infarction has radically changed. Availability of several thrombolytic agents has made reperfusion of ischemic myocardium a routine procedure. Early reperfusion has been shown to be the most powerful intervention to reduce infarct size and minimize left ventricular dysfunction in experimental preparations. Several clinical trials have also demonstrated that patients with acute myocardial infarction may greatly benefit from early thrombolysis, as this procedure is associated with improvement of global and regional left ventricular function and reduction in mortality. However, in spite of its obvious advantages, reperfusion might result in a paradoxical tissue damage that may blunt the net beneficial effect of restoring perfusion of ischemic myocardium. Reperfusion-mediated myocardial injury has been shown to occur in several experimental preparations and it has been proposed that generation of toxic oxygen metabolites at the moment of reflow is responsible for the occurrence of this phenomenon. Indeed, administration of free radical scavengers may significantly reduce the extent of reperfusion injury and improve contractile recovery in experimental preparations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,M Chiariello;P Golino;G Ambrosio

Several studies suggest that hypothermia may preserve myocardial function in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We carried out a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia at reducing infarct size and decreasing major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and all-cause mortality in AMI patients. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, EMBASE, and MEDLINE through July 2010 for studies investigating therapeutic hypothermia in AMI patients. Data were extracted by 2 reviewers. We identified 5 studies (693 patients), 2 of which were feasibility trials and 3 of which were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Feasibility trials showed that therapeutic hypothermia is a safe and feasible intervention. RCTs showed that cardiac outcomes were similar at 30 days' follow-up for the hypothermia and control groups. Mean infarct size ranged from 2.0% to 14.1% of the left ventricle in the hypothermia group and from 8.0% to 13.8% of the left ventricle in the control group. MACEs ranged from 0.0% to 6.2% in the hypothermia group and 3.9% to 10.0% in the control group. All-cause mortality ranged from 0.0% to 3.4% and 2.2% to 10.0% in the hypothermia and control groups, respectively. Subgroup analyses suggested that hypothermia may reduce infarct size in patients with anterior wall infarction. Our review suggests that therapeutic hypothermia is safe and feasible.

Survey of myocardial infarction in Picardie],"The aim of this prospective study carried out in picardy (Aisne, Oise and Somme Departments) between October 1st 1985 and September 30th 1986, was to determine the incidence and outcome of recent myocardial infarction (less than 1 month) hospitalised in the region, to assess the time delay before hospital admission, the mode of management, treatment in the acute phase and at discharge, and the attitudes to exercise stress testing and coronary angiography. All public and private hospitals of the 3 departments who admitted patients with acute myocardial infarction accepted to fill out the questionnaire. A total of 1260 infarcts in patients with an average age of 66.7 +/- 12.6 years were collected. Nearly 3 out of 4 patients were male, and the men generally 10 years younger (64 +/- 12.6 years) than the women (73.4 +/- 10 years). The time delay to hospital admission was very long: 16.6 +/- 47.5 hours. Two thirds of patients were transferred by non medicalised transport; 82 per cent of patients were directed to the casualty department which redirected 71 per cent to the cardiology department. Myocardial infarction was inaugural in 46.5 per cent of cases. The incidence of anterior and inferior infarction was almost identical (44 ans 45.5 per cent respectively). Treatment in the acute phase included Heparin (94 per cent), nitrate derivatives (93.7 per cent) and calcium inhibitors (78 per cent). Thrombolytic and betablocker therapy was only prescribed in 8.3 and 23.5 per cent of cases respectively. During the hospital period, average 17 +/- 9 days, the mortality rate was 22.3 per cent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,G Jarry;J L Richard;J S Hermida;J L Rey;C Tribouilloy;J C Quiret;P Bernasconi

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1533616/,Treatment of acute myocardial infarction: a cardiologist's perspective,"The treatment of acute myocardial infarction can generally be organized along three pathways. First, interventions directed toward alleviating acute myocardial ischemia include oxygen, sublingual nitroglycerin, morphine, aspirin, heparin, and intravenous nitroglycerin. Appropriate patients may also benefit from beta-adrenergic blockers, thrombolytic agents, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, and revascularization with either coronary angioplasty or bypass graft surgery. Second, interventions directed toward assessing and treating acute left ventricular dysfunction include invasive hemodynamic monitoring and echocardiography; maximizing preload; correcting blood gas, serum electrolyte, acid-base, or hemoglobin abnormalities; controlling heart rate; and maintaining AV conduction. Pharmacological agents to consider include diuretics, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, dobutamine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and amrinone. Support devices, coronary angioplasty, and cardiac surgery are also occasionally needed. Third, interventions directed toward preventing or treating arrhythmias and conduction disturbances include atropine, isoproterenol, beta-blockers, verapamil, digitalis, adenosine, lidocaine, procainamide, bretylium, amiodarone, countershock, and cardiac pacing. All of the above information has been drawn from studies in nonsurgical patients. Unfortunately, there is little in the cardiology literature about treatment of patients with perioperative MI [17]. It is of interest to note that most perioperative MI occurs in the postsurgical period, not intraoperatively, and is often painless. As discussed throughout this volume, controlling postoperative stresses--including surgical complications, pulmonary complications, fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, and heart rate and blood pressure responses--is probably important. Serial cardiac enzymes and electrocardiograms improve the diagnostic yield. Treatment options are limited by the fact that many events are non-Q wave infarctions. Also, the increased risk of bleeding from the operative site precludes use of antiplatelet, anticoagulation, and thrombolytic agents. Hemodynamically or electrically unstable patients should be referred for emergency cardiac catheterization and probable coronary angioplasty. Patients at risk for large Q wave MI, heralded by ST-segment elevation in several electrocardiographic leads, should also be considered for invasive treatment. Further clinical investigation of the natural history, diagnosis, and treatment of perioperative MI is sorely needed.",,E R Bates

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9581858/,Diagnostic strategies using myoglobin measurement in myocardial infarction,"Myoglobin, a low molecular-weight heme protein (17800 D) present in both cardiac and skeletal muscle, is an old test with new perspectives. Advantages and disadvantages of myoglobin determination are well known. Myoglobin is the earliest known, commercially available, biochemical marker of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its rapid kinetics make it an early, good marker of reperfusion. However, since myoglobin is present in both skeletal and cardiac muscle, any damage to these muscle types results in its release into blood. Serum myoglobin levels are falsely elevated in conditions unrelated to AMI as skeletal muscle and neuromuscular disorders, renal failure, intramuscular injection, strenuous exercise, and after several toxins and drugs intake. New strategies for myoglobin measurement may resolve this limitation. These strategies include both the combined measurement of myoglobin and a skeletal specific marker (carbonic anhydrase III) or a cardiac specific marker (troponin I), as well as the myoglobin evaluation on serial samples. In particular, the diagnostic algorithm based on the combined measurement of myoglobin and troponin I, assuring a satisfactory analytical turnaround time, significantly improves the diagnostic efficiency of laboratory assessment of suspected AMI patients, allowing the successive monitoring of coronary reperfusion.",,M Plebani;M Zaninotto

Excessive sympathetic activation and serious myocardial remodeling may contribute to this association. The aim of this study was to discuss the effect of depression on sympathetic activity and myocardial remodeling after MI. Wild-type (WT) rats were divided into a sham group (Sham), a myocardial infarction group (MI), a depression group (D), and a myocardial infarction plus depression group (MI+D). Compared with controls, the MI+D animals displayed depression-like behaviors and attenuated body weight gain. The evaluation of sympathetic activity showed an increased level in plasma concentrations of epinephrine and norepinephrine and higher expression of myocardial tyrosine hydroxylase in the MI+D group than the control groups (p<0.05 for all). Cardiac function and morphologic analyses revealed a decreased fractional shortening accompanied by increased left ventricular dimensions, thinning myocardium wall, and reduced collagen repair in the MI+D group compared with the MI group (p<0.05 for all). Frequent premature ventricular contractions, prolonged QT duration and ventricular repolarization duration, shorted effective refractory period, and increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmia were displayed in MI+D rats. These results indicate that sympathetic hyperactivation and exacerbated myocardial remodeling may be a plausible mechanism linking depression to an adverse prognosis after MI.",,Shaobo Shi;Jinjun Liang;Tao Liu;Xiaoran Yuan;Bing Ruan;Lifang Sun;Yanhong Tang;Bo Yang;Dan Hu;Congxin Huang

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8656121/,Analysis of high-frequency signal-averaged ECG measurements,"Analysis of high frequency (150-250 Hz) in the signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG) is one of the emerging methods for detecting vessel patency in acute myocardial infarction following thrombolytic therapy and angioplasty. Root-mean-square voltage (RMSV) of the filtered QRS has been used in earlier studies to detect reperfusion; however, previous analysis indicated that RMSV is sensitive to residual noise in the SAECG and errors in QRS delineation (onset/offset). A new measurement is proposed, high-frequency energy (HFQE), and the robustness of the RMSV and HFQE was evaluated for simulated errors in QRS delineation. In this study, two measures (RMSV and HFQE) were tested on 24 control subjects and 21 patients undergoing thrombolytic therapy. Results indicate that unfiltered QRS duration is more stable than filtered QRS duration for the control subjects and patients and that HFQE had less fluctuation than RMSV in thrombolytic therapy patients. In the control group, HFQE was sensitive to the amplitude variation of the filtered SAECG. Therefore, another new measurement is proposed high-frequency integral of absolute value (HFAV), for reducing the sensitivity to amplitude changes in the filtered SAECG. This new feature was tested on control subjects and was found to be more stable than HFQE. In the thrombolitic therapy group, HFAV provided similar information as HFQE. These three measurements-RMSV, HFQE, and HFAV-provide a comprehensive analysis of the high-frequency SAECG for detecting vessel patency and reocclusion. Relative merits of these measures need to be evaluated on a larger database of patients undergoing thrombolysis and angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction.",,Q Xue;B R Reddy;T Aversano

However, data supporting such an association are limited, and an alternative hypothesis that cardiac vomiting is related to infarct size has also been advanced. The 2 hypotheses were tested in a cross-sectional study of 265 patients consecutively admitted to the coronary care unit. Nausea or vomiting was a good predictor of myocardial infarction (p less than 0.0001). The odds of having an infarction was 3.14 times greater for patients with nausea or vomiting than for those without these symptoms. Nausea was not a good predictor for inferior wall infarction (p = 0.14): 51% of patients with inferior infarcts had nausea or vomiting and 66% with anterior infarcts had these symptoms. Using peak serum creatine kinase level as an index of infarct size, nausea or vomiting was a good predictor of larger infarction. While 55% of all patients with infarction had nausea or vomiting, for patients with infarctions that produced a peak creatine kinase level of more 1,000 IU/liters, 78% had nausea or vomiting. Sex was a marginally important variable. After adjusting for sex, the presence of nausea or vomiting still predicted infarct size (p less than 0.001).

Ventricular assist devices (VADs) offer the advantages of providing greater and longer-term cardiac support than an intra-aortic balloon pump and may improve outcomes when inserted early after heart failure symptoms begin. Pulsatile VADs are versatile and can provide biventricular support but are associated with a higher incidence of serious complications.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22075191/,[Mortality of myocardial infarction],"Coronary disease is a major cause of death and disability. From 1975 to 2000, coronary mortality was reduced by half. Better treatments and reduction of risk factors are the main causes. This phenomenon is observed in most developed countries, but mortality from coronary heart disease continues to increase in developing countries. In-hospital mortality of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is in the range of 7 to 10% in registries. In infarction without ST segment elevation (NSTEMI), in-hospital mortality is around 5%. More recent studies found a similar in-hospital mortality for STEMI and NSTEMI. Because of patient selection and monitoring, mortality in clinical trials is much lower. After adjustment for the extent of coronary disease, age, risk factors, history of myocardial infarction, the excess mortality observed in women is fading. Many clinical, biological and laboratory parameters are associated with mortality in myocardial infarction. They refer to the immediate risk of death (ventricular rhythm disturbances, shock…), the extent of infarction (number of leads with ST elevation on the ECG, release of biomarkers, ejection fraction…), the presence of heart failure, the failure of reperfusion and the patient's baseline risk (age, renal function…). Risk scores, and more specifically the GRACE risk score, synthesize these different markers to predict the risk of death in a given patient. However, their use for the treatment of myocardial only concerns NSTEMI. Only a limited number of mechanical or pharmacological interventions reduces mortality of heart attack. The main benefits are observed with reperfusion by thrombolysis or primary angioplasty in STEMI, aspirin, heparin, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Some medications such as bivalirudin and fondaparinux reduce mortality by decreasing the incidence of hemorrhagic complications. The guidelines classify interventions according to their benefit and especially their ability to reduce mortality. Organized care systems that improve implementation of guidelines also reduce mortality. Finally, some new therapeutic approaches such as post-conditioning and new therapeutic classes offer encouraging prospects for further reducing the mortality of myocardial infarction.",,E Bonnefoy;G Kirkorian

Data were also collected for 627 patients who were screened but excluded. Among the 1,167 patients, no diurnal pattern of onset could be found at either 2- or 6-hour intervals. Among the 540 patients enrolled in the trial, no pattern could be found at these intervals either, although at 8-hour intervals, 27% of infarctions occurred between midnight and 8:00 AM, compared with 37% between 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM and 36% between 4:00 PM and 12:00 AM (p = 0.02). In contrast to the patterns previously noted for Q wave myocardial infarction, there was no preponderance of non-Q wave infarction in the late morning. Circadian rhythm was also absent among patients not treated with beta-blockers as well as among patients presenting with ST segment elevation on their enrollment electrocardiograms. Diabetics, women, and patients with first infarction were more likely to present during the afternoon hours. We conclude that the late morning preponderance seen for Q-wave myocardial infarction is not discernable in patients with non-Q wave myocardial infarction. This observation suggests that the pathogenesis of these two infarct subtypes is different or that the process of thrombotic coronary occlusion in Q wave infarction (sustained) differs from that in non-Q wave infarction (nonsustained).",,N S Kleiman;K B Schechtman;P M Young;D A Goodman;W E Boden;C M Pratt;R Roberts

The Israeli Thrombolytic Survey Group,"A national study was performed in early 1992 in the 25 operating coronary care units in Israel, which enabled the assessment of whether the therapeutic management of patients with acute myocardial infarction was affected by patient gender. During a 2-month period, 1,014 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction were hospitalized. Thrombolytic therapy was given to 47% of men (362 of 769), and 43% of women (106 of 245) (p = NS). After adjustment for age, no gender differences in the administration of thrombolytic therapy were noted (odds ratio 0.95; 95% confidence interval 0.73-1.23). Coronary angiography was more frequently performed in men (22%) than in women (16%) (p < 0.05). However, no gender differences in the use of angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery performed during the index hospitalization were found (10% in men, and 8% in women). The main reasons for ineligibility for thrombolytic therapy were: late hospital arrival, absence of qualifying ST-T changes on admission electrocardiogram, and contraindications to thrombolytic therapy. Hospital death was significantly lower in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy (37 of 456; 8%) than in those excluded from thrombolysis (70 of 540;13%) (p < 0.01). This difference was significant for men, but not for women. The 1-year postdischarge mortality was 4% in patients treated compared with 12% in those ineligible for thrombolysis (p < 0.01).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2636623/,[Precordial ST segment depression in acute inferior myocardial infarction: the importance of posterolateral wall infarction],"To determine whether precordial ST segment depression during acute inferior myocardial infarction indicates posterolateral wall ischemia, anatomical predominance of coronary circulation was examined by coronary angiography and evaluated in 43 patients who experienced first acute inferior myocardial infarction. Among patients who underwent intracoronary thrombolysis within six hours from the onset of symptoms, the infarct-related artery was the right coronary artery (RCA) in 35. In addition, their early 12-lead electrocardiographic features were compared with those in eight patients having the infarct-related left circumflex coronary artery (group Cx). Thirty-five patients with RCA obstruction were categorized in four groups: Four patients with left predominant type (group L), 10 with balanced type (group B), five with right super-predominant type (group SR), and 16 with right intermediate type (group RI). Seventeen of the 21 patients in groups SR and RI demonstrated precordial ST segment depression, whereas it was present in only six of the 14 patients in groups L and B (p less than 0.05). Of the 29 patients in groups SR, Cx and RI, total ST segment depression in leads V1 through V4 (sigma ST) was greater in the 14 patients in groups L and B (p less than 0.05) than in other groups. Furthermore, in these 29, all patients in groups SR and Cx had greater sigma ST than did the patients in group RI (p less than 0.05). There was no significant difference in sigma ST between groups SR and Cx. Precordial ST segment depression did not correlate with concomitant disease of the left anterior descending artery and was not a mirror image of ST segment elevation in inferior leads. On thallium-201 scintigraphy, additional perfusion defects of the posterolateral wall were present in all eight patients in group Cx and in ten of the 21 patients in groups SR and RI. Thus, precordial ST segment depression during acute inferior myocardial infarction seemed to be affected by the pattern of coronary circulation. It was concluded that this ST depression represents more extensive involvement of the posterolateral wall in patients with right predominant coronary circulation as well as in those with left circumflex artery obstruction.",,K Nishian;Y Nomoto;H Naruse;K Kawakami;S Asakuma;J Tateishi;N Yasutomi;K Fujitani;T Iwasaki

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6765633/,Medical management of ischemic heart disease,"Medical therapy primarily affects myocardial oxygen demands. Nitrates and other vasodilators decrease filling pressure, ventricular diastolic volume and to some extent, impedance to ventricular emptying. Beta blockers decrease myocardial contractility and heart rate through a reduction of sympathetic neural traffic. Afterload reduction by the control of hypertension and preload reduction via the LaPlace relationship through reversal of congestive failure are critical for successful therapy. Modification of smoking habits and personality traits with renunciation of a sedentary life-style are also therapeutically useful. While increases in myocardial blood flow have depended primarily on surgical revascularization procedures, calcium antagonists such as nifedipine have been shown to affect flow by reversing vasospasm, which has been recognized with increasing frequency as a concomitant of even fixed coronary arterial disease. The first therapy, however, is diet since it affects both the supply and demand sides of myocardial oxygen balance. Reduction of body bulk decreases myocardial oxygen demand since both vary in obligate parallel. Religious abstention from saturated fats and cholesterol-containing foods, especially by those with pre-existing coronary heart disease, may arrest the otherwise inexorable deterioration.",,G C Timmis

It is assumed that the treatment is similar to that of the left ventricle, although there are some differences. The axis of the therapeutic management, as well as the left ventricle infarction, is based on early myocardial reperfusion, particularly through percutaneous coronary interventionism. Throm-bolysis is an option, especially after an increase in systemic blood pressure using vasoactive drugs such as norepinephrine. The preload optimization by volume administration during resuscitation of shock is useful, but it must be with caution. The use of levosimendan could be potentially beneficial option.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26582252/,Women's help-seeking behaviour during a first acute myocardial infarction,"Studies indicate that the time from onset of symptoms to medical treatment has decreased in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, there are still variations indicating that women wait longer than men before making the decision to seek medical care. Multidimensional factors hindering and facilitating the decision have been identified in previous studies, though few have fully explored how social context affects women's expectations, interpretations and actions and so influences the decision-making process. The aim of this study was therefore to identify how women's experiences interacted and influenced the decision to seek medical care at their first AMI. Seventeen women, aged 38-75 years, were interviewed, at home or in the hospital, between June 2011 and May 2012. Grounded theory was used as a method, and data collection and analysis were carried out simultaneously. The results showed that before deciding to seek medical care, these women went through three defined but interrelated processes that together hindered their normal activities and made them act according to existential needs. The women's experiences of the progression of the disease, in terms of both symptoms and time, were very different, so they sought medical care at different times, sometimes life-threateningly late and sometimes before developing an AMI. Three mechanisms had to coincide if the women were to receive medical care. First, the women had to acknowledge their symptoms as something more than common bodily changes. Second, the healthcare system had to be accessible when the women made their decision to seek care. Third, the women must have come into contact with healthcare providers when the heart muscle had taken enough damage to measure.",acute myocardial infarction; decision-making; gender; grounded theory; healthcare-seeking; women's health.,Anna Gyberg;Lena Björck;Susanne Nielsen;Sylvia Määttä;Kristin Falk

At the end of the procedure, an Impella CP® mechanical cardiac-assist device was inserted. Rapid and marked improvement in the hemodynamic status was noted in the following days. The Impella CP® was withdrawn after five days and the patient was discharged two weeks later. Despite limited data, mechanical cardiac assistance is recommended in cardiogenic shock. Several devices are currently available; the choice of the system is based on the clinical presentation and the experience of each center. The Impella CP® is a microaxial pump which is inserted percutaneously and delivers up to 3.5L/min of continuous flow.

An intensive drug treatment with thrombocyte aggregation inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-receptor blocking agents must be carried out according to the current guidelines. An important factor is the high risk of renal failure due to the contrast dye administered during PCI in the presence of pre-existing diabetic kidney damage which should be limited to 100 ml if possible. Direct PCI should be limited to the infarcted vessel. After stabilization a comprehensive strategy to cure coronary artery disease, whether with PCI or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) should be finalized.

This mortality has considerably decreased since the active management of the acute phase of myocardial infarction. This has made it more complex to evaluate the post-infarction electrical risk and may have reduced the need. However, it is not less true that the assessment of the post-infarction risk necessitates a study of each factor predisposing to severe ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death: myocardial ischaemia, left ventricular dysfunction and electrical instability. The latter parameter may be assessed by non-invasive (ventricular extrasystoles, late ventricular potentials, heart rate variability, the baroreflex and the QT interval) and invasive methods (programmed ventricular stimulation).

The aims of this article are to evaluate the prevalence and incidence of silent myocardial infarction in subjects with or without a history of cardiovascular disease and in diabetic patients, and to identify potential risk factors and estimate prognosis through a review of the literature. A Medline search identified studies that provided data on the prevalence, incidence, potential risk factors and/or prognosis of silent myocardial infarction, among cohorts from the general population and large clinical studies of at-risk patients (with hypertension or a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes). The search identified 15 studies in subjects from the general population, five in hypertensive patients, six in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, and 10 in diabetic patients. The prevalence and incidence of silent myocardial infarction appear highly variable depending on the population studied, the patients' ages, and the method used to detect silent myocardial infarction. In the general population, the prevalence of silent myocardial infarction increased markedly with increasing age (up to>5% in elderly subjects). Hypertension causes only a moderate increase in prevalence, whereas underlying cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are associated with marked increases in prevalence. The incidence of silent myocardial infarction changes in the same way.

On the other hand, onset of cardiac morphological changes in this setting may potentially extend far beyond this time frame (usually beyond several months after the index AMI), suggesting a prolonged latent period in certain cases. In clinical practice, this delayed form of post-AMI remodeling, namely late AMR, has emerged as an interesting and underrecognized phenomenon with poorly understood mechanisms.

The mean time from the onset of acute myocardial infarction to injection of the tracer was 5.6 +/- 1.5 h (range 2.8 to 11.9 h). All 36 patients underwent successful recanalization. Patients with strongly positive technetium-99m pyrophosphate uptake in anterior acute myocardial infarction had a significantly lower regional ejection fraction and a significantly larger thallium-201 defect score than those with 2+ positive results in chronic stage. Similarly, in inferior acute myocardial infarction, the thallium-201 defect score was significantly larger in patients with strongly positive uptake than in those with 2+ and negative uptake scores. In conclusion, strongly positive results in early technetium-99m pyrophosphate scintigraphy within 12h after the onset of acute myocardial infarction may indicate failure in limiting the infarct size by coronary thrombolysis.",,M Kondo;Y Yuzuki;H Shimizu;A Tanaka;M Chou;Y Shimono

Infarction occurred during golf in 12 patients, bowling in 4, gateball in 4, jogging or running in 5, baseball in 2, and tennis or table tennis in 3. The majority of the patients were playing ball games. Twenty-seven patients were men (90%) and 3 were women (10%). All patients had played the same kind of sport for several years. Twenty-four patients had one or more coronary risk factors, and especially 18 patients smoked cigarettes. Nine patients had experienced anterior chest pain but only two patients had received medical evaluation. Coronary angiography was performed in 25 patients (83.3%), revealing single-vessel disease in 14, two-vessel disease in 6, three-vessel disease in 4, and disease of all left main coronary trunks in 1. The acute episode of infarction occurred mainly in spring or fall. Many patients with acute myocardial infarction occurring during sport participate in sports of low or moderate dynamic and low static exercises which are generally regarded safe. Many patients had enjoyed their sports regularly for a long time. Though many patients had coronary risk factors, only a few had received a medical check before their heart attack.",,M Fujiwara;S Asakuma;K Nakamura;T Nakamura;N Yasutomi;T Iwasaki
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2742427/,"The incidence and prognosis of unrecognized myocardial infarction in the Honolulu, Hawaii, Heart Program","The incidence of clinically unrecognized myocardial infarctions among 7331 Japanese-American men in Hawaii, aged 45 to 68 years and free of coronary heart disease at entry, was studied on the basis of electrocardiographic changes between successive examinations during 6 years of follow-up. The proportion of asymptomatic myocardial infarction accounted for 33% of transmural (Q-wave) myocardial infarctions identified by temporal changes on electrocardiogram and 22% of all nonfatal infarctions ascertained by either repeated examinations or hospital surveillance. The 10-year prognosis of unrecognized infarction, in terms of mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and coronary heart disease, was worse (with risk ratios of 1.5 to 1.7) than that of recognized infarction, even after adjusting for age and other possible determinants, although the differences were not statistically significant. These findings suggest that regular health check-ups with an electrocardiogram would be important to detect asymptomatic myocardial infarction and to increase the opportunity of taking secondary preventive measures. However, the conclusion should await further studies based on intervention trials to determine the comparative effects of the secondary prevention on the prognosis of clinically recognized vs unrecognized infarction.",,K Yano;C J MacLean

In the long-term Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial, there were 514 patients with non-Q wave myocardial infarction; 279 patients were randomized to the placebo group and 235 to the treatment group. The average follow-up period was 25 months. There was no difference in baseline clinical characteristics between the two groups. Early reinfarction (less than or equal to 6 months) occurred in 17 patients in the placebo group and in 2 patients in the diltiazem group (p less than 0.001). Late reinfarction (greater than 6 months) occurred in 13 patients in the placebo group and in 14 patients in the diltiazem group (p = NS). Initial and reinfarction electrocardiograms (ECGs) were analyzed by using a coding system that permitted identification of standard anatomic areas involved in the infarction process. Thirty-one of the 46 patients had a localized infarction on index and reinfarction ECGs. In the early reinfarction group, 10 (77%) of 13 infarctions occurred in the same ECG region in which the initial infarction had occurred; all 10 were in patients in the placebo group. Among the 18 patients with late reinfarction, the site of the second infarction was the same as that of the first in 9 patients and differed in 9.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23716568/,Invasive measurement of coronary microvascular resistance in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated by primary PCI,"Up to 40% of patients with acute myocardial infarction develop microvascular obstruction (MVO) despite successful treatment with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The presence of MVO is linked to negative remodelling and left ventricular dysfunction, leading to decreased long-term survival, increased morbidity and reduced quality of life. The acute obstruction and dysfunction of the microvasculature can potentially be reversed by pharmacological treatment in addition to the standard PCI treatment. Identifying patients with post-PCI occurrence of MVO is essential in assessing which patients could benefit from additional treatment. However, at present there is no validated method to identify these patients. Angiographic parameters like myocardial blush grade or corrected Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow do not accurately predict the occurrence of MVO as visualised by MRI in the days after the acute event. Theoretically, acute MVO can be detected by intracoronary measurements of flow and resistance directly following the PCI procedure. In MVO the microvasculature is obstructed or destructed and will therefore display a higher coronary microvascular resistance (CMVR). The methods for intracoronary assessment of CMVR are based on either thermodilution or Doppler-flow measurements. The aim of this review is to present an overview of the currently available methods and parameters for assessing CMVR, with special attention given to their use in clinical practice and information provided by clinical studies performed in patients with acute myocardial infarction.",,Raquel P Amier;Paul F A Teunissen;Koen M Marques;Paul Knaapen;Niels van Royen

Group 1 consisted of 604 (36.6 %) patients with a total time of myocardial ischemia not exceeding 1880 min; group 2 included 531 (32.2 %) patients with a duration of myocardial ischemia from 180 to 360 min; and group 3 included 514 (31.2 %) patients with a duration of myocardial ischemia longer than 360 min.Results Mortality was lower in group 1 (2.3 %) than in groups 2 and 3 (6.2 and 7.2 %, respectively; p1-2=0.001; p1-3&lt;0.001; p2-3=0.520). The incidence of major cardiac complications (""adverse cardiac events"", MACE) was lower in group 1 (4.1 %) than in groups 2 and 3 (7.3 and 9.5 %, respectively, p1-2=0.020; p1-3&lt;0.001; p2-3=0.200). The incidence of no-reflow phenomenon was higher in group 3 (9.7 %) than in groups 2 and 3 (4.5 and 5.3 %, respectively (p1-2=0.539; p1-3=0.001; p2-3=0.005).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8813858/,Heart rate variability in time domain after acute myocardial infarction,"These results suggest that analysis of heart rate variability recorded even very early after acute myocardial infarction (1 to 2 days after onset of pain) is feasible in clinical routine and strongly related to subsequent arrhythmic events and cardiac mortality. Decreased HRV is considered not only a marker of impaired vagal activity of the heart but complete autonomic impairment, strongly associated with the degree of myocardial damage. HRV represents the integrated response of the cardiovascular system to a variety of different influences: the plasma level of catecholamines, the baroreflex activation and the direct sympathetic and vagal activity. The HRV profile is dynamic-HRV reduction caused by myocardial damage changes over time presenting a progressive increase up to normality over a 2-month follow-up. The observed early differences between anterior and inferior myocardial infarction disappear later in the healing phase. However, group analysis results of different HRV indices are stabile over time and highly reproducible, but presenting large individual variations. HRV parameters which are adjusted to heart rate (e. g. CV) seemed to be more stabile. The role of HRV analysis in risk stratification of patients after myocardial infarction is strongly related to the actual model of the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias. Multiple experimental and clinical studies described the development of life threatening ventricular arrhythmias as a multifactorial event which can not be described adequately using just one risk parameter for stratification. The arrhythmogenic substrate representing the underlying inhomogeneity of electrical behaviour of adjacent myocardial areas might be detectable by the analysis of ventricular late potentials or frequency disturbances from the signal averaged ECG. The autonomic modulation of this substrate is represented by an altered heart rate variability. Possible trigger factors to initiate arrhythmias in a modulated arrhythmogenic substrate like ventricular premature beats or transient myocardial ischemia can be detected by conventional arrhythmia and ST segment analysis from Holter tapes. The optimized combination of these non-invasive risk predictors together with well known evident clinical risk parameters, like left ventricular ejection fraction, may lead to a valid set of screening parameters for individual risk estimation after myocardial infarction.",,T Fetsch;L Reinhardt;M Mäkijärvi;D Böcker;M Block;M Borggrefe;G Breithardt

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2360531/,Influence of coronary arterial thrombus location on left ventricular function in acute myocardial infarction,"In 238 patients with acute myocardial infarction studied during intracoronary streptokinase therapy, the circumferential extent of left ventricular hypokinesis was measured by 5 methods and correlated with the location of the infarct-related coronary artery segment and with 1-year survival. Of the 5 methods, 1 focused only on the infarct region, and 4 varied in the complexity of the noise filter. Hypokinetic segment length measurements by all 5 methods correlated significantly with the location of occlusion along the left anterior descending coronary artery. No method yielded measurements that correlated with occlusion location along the right coronary artery. Measurements by all methods correlated significantly with survival, but the method that focused on the infarct region performed least well. Thus, the circumferential extent of hypokinesis in patients with acute myocardial infarction is greater for proximal than mid- or distal occlusions of the left anterior descending but not the right coronary artery. Survival is influenced by the function of periinfarct and noninfarct regions and by the function of the infarct region. Complex noise filters provide no advantage over simpler filters in measuring the extent of hypokinesis.",,F H Sheehan;W G Schmidt;E L Bolson

Less widely known, however, has been the fact that Q waves need not be a permanent feature and may disappear or decrease in quantity in some patients. For some time, the Q wave was perceived as a transmural extent of predominantly non-viable myocardial structures (scars or fibrosis). A most effective method for infarct-related artery recanalization is now available and the latest techniques have demonstrated beyond any doubt that even an invariable Q wave need not necessarily indicate loss of myocardial viability. Even in the era of thrombolysis, successful recanalization of an infarctrelated artery led to a specific ECG pattern in patients undergoing artery recanalization or reperfusion of the corresponding myocardial segment. The main features included a decrease in Q waves and, possibly, an increase in R waves in the ECG leads reflecting the respective ischemic events. This overview provides evidence of the significance of the Q wave in the ECG. It therefore comes as a surprise that modern cardiology has given so little attention to the above facts.",,J Sochman

(1) Abnormal left ventricular wall motions corresponding to the electrocardiographic sites of infarction were seen in the echocardiograms in 80 % of total patients and 100 % of acute cases. Exaggerated wall motion in opposing noninfarcted areas was seen in 50 % of acute cases and 10 % of old cases. Quantitative analysis of asynergy could be made by comparing PWE, SE and those ratios to EDD-ESD of infarcted hearts with those of normal hearts. (2) In acute myocardial infarction, abnormal motions of left ventricular wall are marked in acute phase and diminished in extent gradually in recovery phase. But in some cases, echo-demonstrated segmental dyskinesis did not disappear in recovery phase, possibly due to the presence of irreversible myocardial damage. (3) Echographic thickness of the infarcted wall was less increased then normals or was not increased during systole and decreased when bulged out in some cases, indicating the existence of necrotized muscle. Moreover, multiple echoes sometimes seen between endocardial and epicardial echoes of infarcted myocardium were considered to display the fibrosis of the infarcted myocardium. (4) Abnormal echocardiographic motions of septum and posterior wall were observed in some cases who had no electrocardiographic abnormalities which suggest septal or posterior wall involvement. Echocardiography could detect another affected area of the left ventricle which could not be detected by electrocardiography. (5) Echocardiography in combination with B-scan imaging (UCKG, UCTG) can detect not only the location, but also the size and extent of myocardial infarction. (6) The results of this study indicate that echocardiography and B-scan imaging (UCKG, UCTG) are sensitive methods in detecting the size and location of asynergy and making a precise diagnosis of myocardial infarction.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6400007/,Infarct size as a determinant of acute and long-term prognosis,"Enzymatic estimates of infarct size based on the analysis of either plasma total or CK-MB activity are substantially larger in patients who succumb to myocardial infarction compared with survivors. Similarly, if patients are stratified according to infarct size calculations, mortality increases as infarct size increases. Enzymatic markers of infarction are closely related to other indicators of prognosis, including infarct type (transmural versus nontransmural), infarct location (anterior versus inferior), the degree of left and right ventricular dysfunction, and the frequency of ventricular dysrhythmia. Hence, at least some of the prognostic impact of these variables may be due to the initial extent of infarction sustained. Multivariate analysis has been employed by several groups to analyze the independent contribution of these clinical descriptors to prognosis after infarction. These analyses have consistently indicated a substantial independent impact of enzymatic estimates of infarct size on prognosis. In studies of patients with initial myocardial infarction, infarct size index calculated from total plasma CK time activity curves had the greatest independent influence on survival. Unfortunately, the utility of enzymatic estimates of infarction as prognostic indicators in individual patients is attenuated by alterations in the strength of the apparent association between CK infarct size and prognosis in specific clinical situations. Thrombolytic therapy is now employed with increasing frequency during acute myocardial infarction. It has become abundantly clear that plasma CK release kinetics are profoundly modified by this procedure. Peak plasma total and CK-MB activity is markedly increased compared with that of patients undergoing routine therapy for infarction, with a profoundly altered CK time activity curve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,E M Geltman

As Killip classes III and IV, Killip class II onset in the context of NSTEMI has also proven bad prognosis significance. Beta-blocker therapy has proven benefit to patients with Killip class II in observational studies and small trials. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy shows stronger evidence of benefit in patients with heart failure than in patients without it. Eplerenone is indicated for patients with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure or diabetes mellitus. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators improve survival in patients with severe ventricular dysfunction after a myocardial infarction. Cardiac resynchronization therapy indications must be carefully assessed due to the high rate of implants that do not fulfill guidelines indications. In conclusion, heart failure during a NSTEMI is a common and meaningful situation which warrants careful management and further investigation to reach stronger evidence for clinical recommendations.",,E Franco;I J Núñez-Gil;D Vivas;B Ruiz Mateos;B Ibañez;N Gonzalo;C Macaya;A Fernández Ortiz

Longitudinal dissociation (dual atrioventricular nodal pathways),"Four cases of longitudinal dissociation of the atrioventricular node, with dual pathways developing during the acute phase of an inferior wall myocardial infarction (three cases) or during acute ischemia (one case), are presented. In all four cases, two grossly different P-R intervals were recorded, and in two cases, studies of the His bundle confirmed the location of the dissociation within the atrioventrcular node. In one case, premature atrial depolarization caused a bidirectional shifting of P-R intervals, while in the remaining three cases, premature ventricular depolarization (spontaneous or pacemaker-induced) was responsible for this phenomenon. In all cases, evidence of longitudinal dissociation of the atrioventricular node appeared during the acute phase of the infarction or ischemia, and in all of them the phenomenon was transient. This favors the assumption that this phenomenon is of a functional nature, most probably related to the ischemic lesion of the atrioventricular node.",,S Sclarovsky;B Strasberg;R Lewin;J Agmon
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22322079/,Post-myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock is a systemic illness in need of systemic treatment: is therapeutic hypothermia one possibility?,"Early observations of cardiogenic shock as a systemic clinical syndrome were first described in 1942. Today, cardiogenic shock remains the leading cause of death among patients hospitalized for myocardial infarction (MI). Mortality rates in post-MI cardiogenic shock approach 50% despite rapid revascularization, optimal medical care, and use of mechanical support. New therapeutic strategies with global systemic effects may offer advances in treatment and outcome in post-MI cardiogenic shock. Therapeutic hypothermia for post-MI cardiogenic shock has multiple potentially beneficial physiologic effects, including the potential to improve post-ischemic cardiac function and hemodynamics, decrease myocardial damage, and reduce end-organ injury from prolonged hypoperfusion. Available data in animal models of post-MI cardiogenic shock and ischemia/reperfusion injury and small case series of human patients with cardiogenic shock suggest its promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for cardiogenic shock in the post-MI setting. We hypothesize that systemic therapeutic hypothermia could decrease morbidity and mortality in post-MI patients with cardiogenic shock and warrants study a new treatment that could be widely available at hospitals worldwide.",,Brian M Stegman;L Kristin Newby;Judith S Hochman;E Magnus Ohman

Of these, 5,778 patients were included. Current treatment with either beta blockers or calcium-channel blockers (51%) was the most predominant reason for exclusion. The randomized and excluded patients differed. The randomized patients were younger and more often men. The mean age of the patients was 59 years in both the placebo and the metoprolol groups. The 2 groups were evenly balanced with regard to basic demographic variables. The median delay between onset of symptoms and randomization was 7 hours, and 25% of the patients were included within 4 hours. Previous clinical history and pharmacologic treatment given before admission were well balanced in the groups. Mean heart rate for the 2 groups before randomization was 83 beats/min and systolic blood pressure was 141 mm Hg. Approximately 15% of randomized patients presented with pulmonary rales.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16239496/,The elusive clot: the controversy over coronary thrombosis in myocardial infarction,"After Heberden's description of patients with ""angina pectoris"" in 1768, for over 125 years most physicians believed that the disease was immediately fatal. The growing realization early in the twentieth century that in fact patients could survive an acute myocardial infarction led to a search for mechanisms and treatment. Coronary thrombosis was the primary candidate for the inciting event, but this supposition was based on rather piecemeal and uncritical reports. It became apparent that coronary thrombosis and acute myocardial infarction (AMI), terms that had often been used interchangeably, actually represented separate pathological entities. A few physicians even proposed that AMI caused coronary thrombosis rather than the other way around. The reasons for some investigators rejecting the coronary thrombosis hypothesis were ultimately shown to be the result of faulty pathological techniques and interpretations. This debate ended only when in vivo studies (i.e., coronary arteriography in living patients during AMI episodes) finally settled the matter. These events indicate that older theories, even when derived from faulty reasoning or poorly substantiated documentation, might ultimately prove valid. Newer investigative techniques can suddenly clarify issues that have previously seemed irresolvable. The identification of coronary thrombosis in AMI has led to major advances in the treatment of this serious and ubiquitous disease.",,Allen B Weisse
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7484756/,Effect of 100% oxygen administration on infarct size and left ventricular function in a canine model of myocardial infarction and reperfusion,"High oxygen concentrations reduced infarct size in prereperfusion era studies; however, with reperfusion therapy, high oxygen tension carries the theoretical risk of exacerbating reperfusion injury by increasing toxic oxygen-derived free radicals. In this study, two groups of dogs underwent 90 minutes of coronary occlusion and 72 hours of reperfusion. The oxygen group (n = 16) received 100% inspired oxygen from 20 minutes before reperfusion through 3 hours of reperfusion, whereas the room-air group (n = 19) was ventilated with room air. Infarct size (as a percentage of risk area) was reduced by 38% in the oxygen group (26.7% +/- 4.7% vs 43.3% +/- 4.3%; p = 0.017). This benefit was independent of underlying variability in collateral blood flow in individual dogs (p = 0.016 by analysis of covariance [ANCOVA]). Left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly improved in the oxygen group (43% +/- 3% vs 33% +/- 2%; p = 0.008), as was regional function in the infarct zone (p < 0.05).

The duration of the shock was 3 to 4 days and its course indulant. Disorders of central and peripheral hemodynamics are of principal pathogenetic importance in cardiogenic shock; these were studied by the method of dilution of T-1824 dye. Of auxiliary importance are autoantigens entering the blood from the zone of myocardial infarction 6 hours after the onset of the disease and possessing depressor, negative inotropic and cardiotoxic properties. This was established in experiments on intact and sensitized dogs.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9213818/,[Age as a factor in the clinical and prognostic picture and the incidence of myocardial infarct],"The purpose of this review is to determine whether advancing age is an independent predictor of increased mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Atypical presentations of infarction-related symptoms in the elderly are common, with consequent delay in the diagnosis and treatment. Advancing age is associated with changes in cardiovascular structure and function, that might predispose to adverse outcome of the older infarcted patient, who presents more frequent previous coronary events, ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure. Non cardiac unfavorable data, such as impaired renal function, diabetes and hypertension, are also frequently associated. In elderly patients, several complications of AMI are more common, as external cardiac rupture, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, conduction disturbances. On the contrary, lower values of cardiac enzymes, indicating a lower amount of myocardial necrosis, are observed in older patients. AMI complications are related to the more frequent mortality in elderly patients. The medications proven to reduce mortality, as thrombolytic therapy, aspirin, heparin, beta-blockers, are less frequently employed than in younger patients, despite similarities in a variety of clinical indexes of the extent of myocardial damage. After AMI, coronary angiography is also performed less often in elderly patients; consequently myocardial revascularization with angioplasty or aortocoronary bypass are less employed, despite undoubted therapeutic advantages at all ages. In patients more than 70 years old, AMI affects the female gender more than men; these data involve other particular problems concerning prognosis and therapy. The present benefits, as pointed out by the recent progress in AMI therapy, must be employed in the treatment of older infarcted patients. They go on to suggest that more aggressive management in elderly patients should be evaluated for its potential to reduce mortality.",,E Astorri

It provides insights into the individual patient's prognosis and guides therapeutic decisions. MRI has long been considered the standard of reference in the noninvasive imaging of myocardial infarction. Only recently have different multidetector-row spiral computed tomography (MDCT) techniques successfully been evaluated for the visualization of myocardial infarction. This article describes different concepts of cardiac MDCT imaging in acute and chronic myocardial infarction. MDCT assessment of myocardial edema, myocardial perfusion and delayed myocardial contrast enhancement are introduced, with the latter evolving as key concept of viability imaging by means of MDCT. The current status of MDCT in the diagnostic work-up of myocardial infarction is reviewed.",,Andreas H Mahnken

The authors therefore examined whether these higher case-fatality rates were associated with greater prevalence of previously diagnosed coronary heart disease or diabetes; with greater age, frequency of definite myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure; with higher values of indicators of severity of infarction, including peak creatine phosphokinase levels and scales prognostic of early mortality after myocardial infarction; and with differences in receipt of in-hospital therapy. The overall 28-day case-fatality rate among 1,228 patients hospitalized for myocardial infarction during a 24-month period was 7.3%. After adjustment for age; diabetes; myocardial infarction class (definite vs. possible); congestive heart failure; the Norris and Peel severity indices; peak total creatine phosphokinase; and receipt of thrombolytic therapy, aspirin, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, anticoagulants, angioplasty, and bypass surgery, the risk of 28-day case-fatality for Mexican Americans in relation to non-Hispanic whites was 1.49 (95% confidence interval 0.92-2.40).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/943242/,Natural history of myocardial infarction and its prodromal syndromes,"Angiographic studies have shown that the severity of obstructive coronary artery disease is a major facor determining mortality in patients with coronary artery disease. The symptomatic presentation of patients with coronary artery disease appears to be less important in determining survival than the extent of coronary artery narrowing. The extent of left ventricular dysfunction is a second major factor that determines survival. The extent of myocardial damage is also important in determining survival in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Infarct extension has been found to be a frequent occurrence in patients with acute anterior transmural infarction. Since infarct extension often occurs several days after hospital admission, an opportunity may exist to apply therapeutic interventions prophylactically to prevent or limit this additional myocardial loss. To limit the extent of myocardial damage that results from infarction may also help to reduce the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias that occur in the second week after infarction, since these arrhythmias are associated with relatively high peak CPK values and a low left ventricular ejection fraction. Studies in patients with acute nontransmural infarction suggest that infarct size may not be the major factor that affects long term survival but other factors, possibly the extent of coronary artery narrowing, may be important. Although in-hospital mortality following acute infarction may have been altered over the past decade by coronary care units, there is little to suggest that prehospital or late mortality following hospital discharge have been altered. If overall mortality associated with infarction is to be reduced, therapeutic interventions to reduce both the extent of myocardial damage and extent or effect of severe coronary artery narrowing will have to be more vigorously applied in the future.",,B Pitt

The images of left ventricular wall was subdivided into 15 segments according to Heger's classification, and the wall motion of the 6 segments corresponding to the perfusion region was visually inspected before and mean 5.9 weeks after coronary intervention. The patients were categorized in 2 groups on the basis of an increase attained in wall motion score of the 6 segments; a group of patients who improved by an increase of 2 points (14 cases) and those who did not improve, not reaching a 2-point increase (7 cases). Three parameters including wall thickness of the infarcted regions, the ratio of the interventricular septum (IVS) to the posterior wall thicknesses, and the systolic wall thickening rate of the septum measured during the acute phase were compared between the 2 groups. In the improved group, the wall thickness of the infarcted region was 9.1 +/- 1.5 mm; whereas, in the unimproved group it was significantly less (7.6 +/- 1.1 mm). The ratio of the septum to posterior wall thicknesses in the improved group (0.88 +/- 0.12) was significantly greater than that of the unimproved group (0.74 +/- 0.11). No significant difference was observed in the systolic wall thickening rate. We concluded that the measurement of wall thickness of the infarcted region in the acute phase in patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction may be useful for predicting the restoration of wall motion after intracoronary reperfusion therapy.",,K Ishii;T Degawa

Despite the compelling scientific and clinical trial evidence that lipid-lowering medications reduce mortality in patients after acute myocardial infarction, this life-saving therapy continues to be underutilized. A number of studies in a variety of clinical settings have documented that a significant proportion of patients after myocardial infarction are not receiving treatment with lipid-lowering medications when guided by conventional care. It has recently been demonstrated that implementation of a hospital-based system for initiation of statins prior to hospital discharge results in a marked increase in treatment rates, improved long-term patient compliance, more patients reaching low-density lipoprotein levels of less than 100 mg/dL, and improved clinical outcomes. Adopting in-hospital initiation of lipid-lowering medications as the standard of care for patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction could dramatically improve treatment rates and thus substantially reduce the risk of future coronary events and prolong life in the large number of patients hospitalized each year.",,Gregg C Fonarow

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4006447/,Real-time serial analysis of infarctional changes in the vectorcardiogram,"Infarct size evolution can be readily assessed from spatial QRS and ST segment changes. A computer system for real-time serial analysis of QRS and ST segment changes in the vectorcardiogram has been developed. QRS detection is done by multichannel template matching, the template being the running average complex. Detection of QRS onset and end is done by a two-dimensional pattern recognition technique on the spatial velocity function using fixed templates. Tested on 216 recordings from 11 patients undergoing myocardial infarction 92.9% of 6050 beats were correctly detected with 0 false detections. The differences between program and referee estimates of QRS onset and of QRS end were computed in 1015 average complexes from the same group of patients. The median (0.05 and 0.95 fractiles) differences were 0.6 msec (-1.9 and 3.9 msec) for QRS onset and -2.0 msec (-16.7 and 3.7 msec) for QRS end. A similar test was made on the annotated CSE database. The results were -2.2 msec (-6.9 and 10.6 msec) for QRS onset and -1.6 msec (-14.6 and 5.2 msec) for QRS end. Systematic errors in QRS onset or QRS end of +/- 8 msec will produce 3-4% error of the average infarct size estimated by QRS vector changes. In conclusion, the present system can provide instantaneous information about the development of myocardial infarction which may be of importance in the management of infarct-limiting treatment.",,P Grøttum

Ds also died twice more often from MI (36%) than matched controls (18%). The excess case fatality rates from MI among Ds were limited to the period between the second and seventh day of hospitalization. The excessive fatality of Ds from MI resulted mainly from the high liability of insulin-dependent diabetic patients (IDDs), with the relative risk of over 4 in relation to NDs.

There was generally a lower mortality rate for metoprolol-treated patients in most subgroups and a consistent tendency for a more pronounced difference between the treatment groups in those subgroups with a placebo mortality rate higher than the average for all placebo patients. Most deaths were cardiac and occurred among patients who developed a definite myocardial infarction (97%) and most of these had a Q-wave infarction (83%). Using a simple model, the placebo mortality was found to increase with increasing number of 8 risk predictors defined from prestudy experience, from 0% in patients with no risk predictors to 11.6% in patients with any 5 or more of these risk factors. Similarly, there was an increase in the difference between the treatment groups in favor of metoprolol with increasing number of placebo risk factors.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22151473/,Intermittent hypobaric hypoxia applicability in myocardial infarction prevention and recovery,"Intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (IHH) has been the focus of important research in cardioprotection, and it has been associated with several mechanisms. Intermittent hypobaric hypoxia inhibits prolyl hydroxylases (PHD) activity, increasing the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and activating crucial adaptative genes. It has been hence suggested that IHH might be a simple intervention, which may offer a thoughtful benefits to patients with acute myocardial infarction and no complications. Nevertheless, several doubts exist as to whether IHH is a really safe technique, with little to no complications in post-myocardial infarction patients. Intermittent hypobaric hypoxia might produce instead unfavourable changes such as impairment of vascular hemodynamics and hypertensive response, increased risk of hemoconcentration and thrombosis, cardiac rhythm perturbations, coronary artery disease and heart failure, insulin resistance, steatohepatitis and even high-altitude pulmonary oedema in susceptible or nonacclimatized patients. Although intermittent and chronic exposures seem effective in cardioprotection, IHH safety issues have been mostly overlooked, so that assorted concerns should be raised about the opportunity to use IHH in the post-myocardial infarction period.

Mechanical complications including acute mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal rupture, and ventricular free-wall rupture can also lead to cardiogenic shock. Rapid diagnosis of cardiogenic shock and its underlying cause is pivotal to delivering definitive therapy.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16182990/,The electrocardiogram in right ventricular myocardial infarction,"Right ventricular (RV) myocardial infarction most often occurs in the setting of inferior wall myocardial infarction. Right ventricular infarction complicates approximately 25% (range, 20%-60%) of inferior acute myocardial infarction; it is uncommon to quite rare in anterior and lateral wall acute myocardial infarction. With infarction of the RV, the RV will fail. As such, left ventricular filling pressures are entirely dependent upon the patient's preload; with significant reductions in the preload, hypotension likely results (this hypotension may be worsened by nitroglycerin and morphine). The clinical presentation, in the setting of an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) of the inferior wall, involves hypotension, jugular venous distension, and the following electrocardiographic findings: ST-segment elevation of greatest magnitude in lead III (compared with leads II and aVF), ST-segment elevation in lead V1, and/or ST-segment elevation in right chest leads (RV1 through RV6). Therapy, in addition to appropriate management for STEMI, relies largely on enhancing the preload with intravenous fluid and judicious use of vasodilator medications.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2653630/,Unrecognized myocardial infarction,"MI is frequently unrecognized for reasons that are unknown, comprising approximately 40 percent of all MIs that occur. Although many unrecognized MIs are accompanied by symptoms of some sort, probably half are totally asymptomatic. Patients with unrecognized MI seem to be similar to those with typical presentations, with similar risk factors and other characteristics. It appears that MI carries the same prognosis whether clinically apparent or not and, therefore, warrants management in both cases. Therapy for silent MI should be aimed at (1) identification and modification of risk factors, (2) identification and treatment of residual ischemia, and (3) attempts at reducing the risk of reinfarction with subsequent morbidity and mortality. As we develop a better understanding of silent ischemic heart disease, hopefully the optimal management strategy for these patients will emerge.",,B D Bertolet;J A Hill

Since psychosocial factors have been implicated in the etiology of sudden cardiac death, it is possible that this association may emerge if sudden cardiac death is distinguished as an outcome distinct from other cardiac mortality. Predictors of sudden death and other cardiac outcomes were examined using data from the Recurrent Coronary Prevention Project, a 4.5-year prospective clinical trial of 1,012 postinfarction patients begun in San Francisco in 1978. A unique set of risk factors was found for the differing outcomes: sudden cardiac death had predominantly psychosocial predictors while nonsudden cardiac death and nonfatal recurrences were predominantly predicted by biologic factors. Type A behavior was an independent predictor of sudden, but not nonsudden, cardiac death in this population (p = 0.04). These results are the first demonstration of a direct relation between stress and sudden cardiac death in a large prospective clinical study, and provide insight into the failure of past prospective studies to find an association between type A behavior and cardiac mortality.",,C D Brackett;L H Powell
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1080822/,Acute myocardial infarction: a surgical emergency,"Preservation of viable myocardium is the primary goal of coronary artery surgery. Our total experience with coronary artery bypass grafting is 1,612 patients, operated upon from March 13, 1969, through Jan. 31, 1975 (2.85 per cent over-all mortality rate). Four hundred thirteen patients were operated upon on an emergency basis. Of this group, 96 were having acute myocardial infarctions and 317 were in the preinfarction syndrome. Emergency coronary artery bypass surgery was performed with 5 deaths (5.2 per cent) in the acute myocardial infarction group and 4 deaths in the preinfarction group (1.26 per cent). These patients had a much lower mortality rate than that of medically treated patients in the acute myocardial infarction group. Postoperative catheterization studies on the acute myocardial infarction group showed a 96 per cent rate of primary graft patency. Follow-up studies through 3 years, 10 months show only 1 late death (4 months after the operation). The in-hospital and the first year mortality rates in a medically treated group with acute myocardial infarction were compared with the surgically treated group. The result was a mortality rate of 30 per cent with medical treatment and 6.3 per cent with surgical treatment. Actuarial analysis demonstrated a greater than 20 per cent difference in mortality rate at 1 year, in favor of surgical treatment.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2068623/,Diagnostic and prognostic importance of comparing the initial to the previous electrocardiogram in patients admitted for suspected acute myocardial infarction,"Two hundred fifty-eight patients were admitted to the hospital for suspected acute myocardial infarction. Electrocardiograms recorded on admission (initial ECG) and the most recent available electrocardiogram recorded before admission (previous ECG) were compared to determine whether changes from the previous to initial ECG predicted acute myocardial infarction or complications of coronary artery disease. Initial ECGs were classed as either positive or negative, with positive indicating either infarction, injury, ischemia, strain, left ventricular hypertrophy, left bundle branch block, or paced rhythm. Negative ECGs were those that did not include any of the positive criteria. Positive and negative ECGs were subgrouped as showing change or no change from previous ECG. We found that patients with a negative initial ECG that had changed from the previous ECG had a 2.1 times greater risk for requiring interventions than those patients whose ECGs were unchanged. We also found that patients with a positive initial ECG that had changed from the previous ECG had a greater risk for interventions (2.0 times), complications (2.6 times), life-threatening complications (4.2 times), and acute myocardial infarction (6.6 times) than the sum of patients in all other ECG categories.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2407156/,Echocardiographic score versus wall motion index for risk stratification after acute myocardial infarction,"Two-dimensional echo cardiographic wall motion scores are potentially valuable prognostic indicators because of their association with subsequent mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Because wall motion scores are relatively simple to obtain, they could come into widespread use. But wall motion scores have been found to have a low positive predictive accuracy in respect to one- or three-year survival and a low specificity in respect to pump failure. To clarify the value of wall motion scores in risk stratification the authors analyzed the ability of a wall motion index, in combination with other variables, to predict death within a year of acute myocardial infarction. Patients were 149 consecutive men with acute myocardial infarction. There were no exclusion criteria. By Cox regression, the variables most closely related to survival were the presence of a pericardial effusion, the age of the patient, alcoholism, and the E point septal separation. The wall motion index, by comparison, was only weakly related to survival and was therefore dropped from further analyses. The four variables most closely related to survival were then used to derive a predictive echocardiographic score. The score's negative predictive accuracy was 94%, although sensitivity and positive predictive accuracy were low. These data suggest that, even when applied nonselectively, the echocardiographic score, but not the wall motion index, appears to be an efficient way of characterizing the outcome of acute myocardial infarction, in that it reliably detects low-risk patients.",,E L Kinney;R J Wright

The flow rate through the apical region and left-ventricular efferent tract was basically similar in normal subjects and coronary patients without myocardial infarction. Where myocardial segmental contractility was disturbed, changes in flow rate are different at different left-ventricular levels and depend on the site of infarction, the extent of left-ventricular involvement and the condition of intact myocardium.

Other anti-ischemic therapies, i.e. nitroderivatives and calcium-antagonists, are easier to manage and there is less need of precise schedules. Our belief is that predischarge exercise testing should be performed on beta-blocker therapy, since we deem unadvisable to interrupt this treatment in the early phase of the postinfarction clinical course, and the reasons are detailed in the text. After myocardial infarction, beta-blockers may reduce the sensitivity of predischarge exercise testing for the diagnosis of inducible ischemia; however, their interference does not seem to affect negatively the prognostic stratification of the test, also in the ""thrombolytic era"". This may be true since beta-blockers hide, but also cure, those forms of inducible ischemia of lower clinical importance, and only inducible ischemia occurring in spite of such therapy might be dangerous and should be treated with myocardial revascularization. Patients receiving thrombolytic treatment are a selected minority at lower clinical risk; it is necessary to emphasize that predischarge exercise testing is more frequently positive in these patients, probably because of the presence of residual stenosis of the infarct-related vessel that may often have a trivial relevance. The test has a lower negative predictive value in these patients, mainly for the higher incidence of reinfarction and ischemic events related to plaque instability, events that none of the provocative tests can predict accurately.",,P Bernabò;G Mazzotta

We need to devise a cost-effective strategy with which to appropriately stratify these patients. Simple, easily ascertained clinical variables that are evident soon after hospital admission can identify higher-risk patients, who are likely to be older and less able to adequately complete an exercise test. In some patients, nuclear imaging tests are appropriate; low-dose dobutamine echocardiography and ambulatory ECG monitoring may also have a role. Greater use of routine cardiac catheterization (with assessment of ventricular function) might be the most appropriate way to stratify patients because it may overcome some of the limitations of noninvasive testing, will clearly define high-risk patients, and may facilitate early discharge from the hospital. Left ventricular function and the patency of the infarct-related artery will be determined, and patients with left main coronary disease, significant three-vessel coronary artery disease, and two-vessel coronary disease (especially with proximal left anterior descending coronary artery involvement) will be identified. An aggressive strategy of revascularization to improve survival in appropriate patients may be employed. Greater use of routine coronary arteriography after acute myocardial infarction would inevitably lower the threshold for inappropriate, potentially risky, and expensive further interventions.

Although there have been advances in the biological understanding of these diseases, they do not account for the complexity of the phenomenon. To address this, the introduction of psychosocial variables have shown that they may be useful to understand the manifestations and evolution of these conditions. Thus, gender gaps should not be studied exclusively from a biomedical perspective. This article reviews the explanations about the gender gaps in the expression of acute myocardial infarction based on gender stereotypes, as an alternative to the biomedical approach. Stereotypes can predict different consequences when they are used by health professionals or patients. Finally, alternatives are proposed to reduce the negative results of the gender stereotype activation when an acute myocardial infarction is suffered. Also new development lines in theoretical, methodological and interdisciplinary work are proposed.",,María Pía Martínez Marín;Ismael Gallardo Cuadra
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1039985/,A symposium on surgery for coronary artery disease. Pre-infarction syndrome--surgical indications,"Although the atherosclerotic process does not penetrate the coronary circulation at subendocardial levesl, the hemodynamic effects of coronary arterial narrowing occur at the endocardial and myocardial cellular levels. Theee resultant deprivation of blood supply to these tissue areas eventually leads to myocardial infarction. In certain clinical situations, a sudden increase in symptoms signifies and impending acute ischemic process. Three parameters have clinically been used to evaluate the changes that lead progressively to myocardial infarction: symptoms, electrocardiogram, and serum enzyme levels. The typical preinfarction patient experiences episodes of acute angina pectoris, sometimes intense and prolonged, and often unresponsive to nitroglycerin. Physical examination is usually not remarkable, serum enzyme levels are normal if tissue damage has not occurred, and the electrocardiogram is variable with pain. Th pathologic process in the preinfarction patient is frequently confined to the proximal arterial segment of one or more of the coronary arteries, usually in the form of a high-grade (in excess of 95 per cent) atherosclerotic lesion. This pathologic condition presents a satisfactory distal arterial segment suitable for bypass, and these patients are ideal candidates for urgent myocardial revascularization.",,E B Diethrich

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19807015/,Accurate diagnosis of right ventricular infarction,"Effective treatment for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is dependent on accurate' diagnoses of the site of infarction. Left ventricular myocardial infarction (LVMI) is the most common form of infarction, of which inferior is the most common site. Patients who have experienced inferior infarctions have a better survival rate than those who have experienced AMIs at other sites. Around one quarter of AMIs affect the right ventricle, and the risk of morbidity for patients who have experienced right ventricular myocardial infarctions is greater than that for patients who have experienced LVMIs. Some authors suggest this is because right-sided heart dysfunction is rarely assessed in standard electrocardiography (ECG), and so opportunities for accurate diagnoses are missed.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6419848/,Role of exercise testing early after myocardial infarction in identifying candidates for coronary surgery,"It has been suggested that ST depression in lead V5 or equivalent on early exercise testing after acute myocardial infarction predicts a high risk of death. To evaluate exercise testing and radionuclide ventriculography in this context 103 consecutive patients with myocardial infarction who were able to undertake a limited exercise test before discharge from hospital were exercised and underwent gated blood pool scanning. No serious complications resulted from exercise testing. Twenty nine patients developed ST depression in lead V5, 19 had exertional hypotension, 31 developed a heart rate of greater than or equal to 130 beats/min, and 15 had complex ventricular arrhythmias. Death during the first year after discharge from hospital was associated with exertional hypotension (p less than 0.001) and a heart rate on exercise testing of greater than or equal to 130 beats/min (p less than 0.05); these two variables identified all nine deaths. Inability to complete the exercise protocol for any reason was also predictive of death (p less than 0.01). Ventricular arrhythmias and ST depression in lead V5 induced by exercise were not significantly associated with an increased risk of death. The mean (SD) radionuclide ejection fraction in the patients who died was 29 (16%) compared with 43 (11)% in the patients who survived (p less than 0.001).

Based on a case-control study, risk factors for nonfatal acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were assessed separately in middle-aged (40-64 years) and older (65-79 years) Japanese. Eligible cases were patients who were admitted to 22 collaborating hospitals for the first AMI between September 1996 and January 1998. Community controls were recruited by using the resident registers of the municipalities with individual matching by gender, year of birth (within 2 years), and proximity in residence. The present study used 384 sets of 384 cases and 656 controls. Smoking, hypertension, and angina pectoris were associated with an increased risk of AMI, and alcohol use and leisure-time exercise were related to a decreased risk of AMI in the elderly as well as in middle-aged persons. There was no apparent relation between body mass index and AMI in either middle-aged or older adults. Diabetes mellitus was significantly associated with an increased risk of AMI in older persons, but not in middle-aged persons.

However, detailed associations between the presentation and initial management at the time of MI and post-MI outcomes in people with asthma compared to the general population have not been studied. A total of 300,161 people were identified with a first MI over the period 2003-2013 in the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project database, of whom 8922 (3%) had asthma. Logistic regression was used to compare presentation, in-hospital care, in-hospital and 180-day post-discharge all-cause mortality in people with and without asthma adjusting for demographics and comorbidities, diagnosis on arrival and secondary prevention. People with asthma were more likely to have a delay in their MI diagnosis following an STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction; odds ratio (OR) 1.38, confidence interval CI 1.06-1.79) but not an nSTEMI (non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction; OR 1.04, CI 0.92-1.17) compared to people without asthma and a delay in reperfusion (OR 1.19, CI 1.09-1.30) following an STEMI. They were much less likely to be discharged on a beta blocker following an STEMI or nSTEMI (OR 0.24, CI 0.21-0.28 and OR 0.27, CI 0.24-0.30, respectively).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3527526/,Current concepts in clinical therapeutics: acute myocardial infarction,"The epidemiology and etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, clinical presentation, complications, and treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are reviewed. Major risk factors for AMI include age, sex (men greater than women), family history, race, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, and diet. AMI occurs when there is a prolonged decrease in oxygen supply to the myocardium caused by coronary thrombosis or coronary vascular spasm. Traditional drug treatment of uncomplicated AMI includes oxygen, laxatives, and analgesics. For analgesia, narcotic agonists are generally preferred, although intravenous nitroglycerin is of value for both reducing infarct size and relieving pain. Fibrinolytic therapy is also indicated in these patients. Low-dose heparin should be initiated on admission to the hospital. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents have proven useful in reducing the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. Antiplatelet agents may also be used to decrease long-term mortality. Recent studies have focused on reduction of infarct size using agents such as beta blockers, calcium-channel blockers, nitroglycerin, and thrombolytics. Revascularization procedures are required in some patients to re-establish adequate coronary perfusion. Most patients who survive AMI initially have a relatively uncomplicated clinical course. An increasing number of therapeutic interventions are available for acute and chronic treatment of AMI.",,F P Zeller;J L Bauman

The collateral circulation is often zero (76% of cases); 80% have adjacent lesions on the right coronary or circumflex artery, but 7 patients out of 25 would have been able to have a preventive bypass operation. The posterior infae lesions are often sited electively at the level of the artery of the S/A node or in the middle of the second vertical segment in the region of the right ventricular branch. Thus the infarct is the result of a complex lesion of the right coronary and circumflex arteries, because the latter is affected in three cases out of four. 63% of patients with a postero-inferior infarction have diffuse lesions, and 13 out of 35 could have had a preventive bypass procedure. This study shows: 1. That this investigation is well-tolerated after a recent infarction; 2. The high incidence (43%) of stenoses at the edge of the area of necrosed myocardium; 3.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1739961/,Right ventricular infarction,"Right ventricular myocardial infarction, long unrecognized because of a lack of diagnostic methods and unsupported beliefs regarding the dispensability of the right ventricle, may now be diagnosed using well-accepted criteria. Right ventricular infarction is clearly associated with anterior left ventricular infarction as well as inferior infarction. It may occur in 30% to 40% of patients with inferior infarction, although a much smaller percentage experience hemodynamic instability on the basis of right ventricular infarction. Pathophysiologically, right ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction are exacerbated by pericardial restraint and concomitant left ventricular dysfunction, accounting for the characteristic findings of cardiogenic shock and marked preload dependence in many patients. Right ventricular infarction may be suspected on the grounds of clinical presentation, physical examination, and enzymatic findings, and is confirmed using well-defined electrocardiographic, radionuclide, echocardiographic, and hemodynamic criteria. Once diagnosed, right ventricular infarction requires specific hemodynamic and pharmacologic management, including the judicious use of volume expansion and inotropic support.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9315566/,Complex causes of fatal myocardial infarction,"It is too often deduced that myocardial infarction is due to coronary occlusion and that subsequent death needs no other explanation. But the great majority of myocardial infarctions are not fatal, whether treated or untreated. There is, of course, some relation to the size of the infarct and the presence or absence of complicating conditions such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension, but little attention has been directed at the myriad of other events and processes influencing the clinical course. Examples include the exact anatomic territory infarcted and whether it includes the sinus node or AV node or important neuroreceptors; whether many small arteries are occluded (especially downstream of narrowed main coronary branches); whether the heart is hypertrophied, dilated, infected, or infiltrated; and whether there may be intracardiac, extracardiac, or intracranial neuropathological conditions that could destabilize cardiac electrical activity. It is now known that apoptosis plays a major role in myocardial infarction or ischemia, but it also occurs within the heart completely independently of infarction. There is also the vexing dilemma that an effective coronary collateral circulation, which is determined primarily by transanastomotic pressure gradient, is made less effective by exactly those treatments that reestablish flow in an occluded coronary artery. Since thrombolysis and angioplasty are automatically considered urgent treatment for an occluded coronary artery, it is prudent to remember the complex causes that determine whether the patient lives or dies.",,T N James

Cigarette smokers and cocaine users are more prone to develop this condition. The possible mechanisms causing myocardial infarction with normal coronary arteries are hypercoagulable states, coronary embolism, an imbalance between oxygen demand and supply, intense sympathetic stimulation, non-atherosclerotic coronary diseases, coronary trauma, coronary vasospasm, coronary thrombosis, and endothelial dysfunction. It primarily affects younger individuals, and the clinical presentation is similar to that of myocardial infarction with coronary atherosclerosis. Thrombolytics, aspirin, nitrates, and beta blockers should be instituted as a standard therapy for acute myocardial infarction. Once normal coronary arteries are identified on subsequent angiography, the calcium channel blockers could be added since coronary vasospasm appears to play a major role in the pathophysiology of this condition. The beta blockers should be avoided in cocaine-induced myocardial infarction because the coronary spasm may worsen. In myocardial infarction with normal coronary arteries, complications such as malignant arrhythmia, heart failure, and hypotension are generally less common, and prognosis is usually good. Recurrent infarction, postinfarction angina, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death are rare. Stress electrocardiography and imaging studies are not useful prognostic tests and long-term survival mainly depends on the residual left ventricular function, which is usually good.",,A Tun;I A Khan

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32750696/,Myocardial Infarction with Nonobstructive Coronary Arteries (MINOCA): A Review of the Current Position,"Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) remains a puzzling clinical entity that is characterized by clinical evidence of myocardial infarction (MI) with normal or near-normal coronary arteries on angiography (stenosis <50%). Major advances in understanding this condition have been made in recent years. The precise pathogenesis is poorly understood and is being studied and examined further. Guidelines indicate that MINOCA is a group of heterogeneous diseases with different mechanisms of pathology. Since there are multiple possible pathological mechanisms, it is not certain that the classical secondary prevention and treatment strategy for MI with obstructive coronary artery disease (MI-CAD) is optimal for MINOCA patients. The prognosis and predictors for MINOCA patients remain unclear. Although the prognosis is slightly better for MINOCA patients than for MI-CAD patients, MINOCA isn't always benign. The aim of this paper was to review the literature and evaluate MINOCA epidemiology, clinical features, etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.",Clinical features; Etiology; MINOCA; Management; Predictors; Prevalence; Prognosis.,Fuad A Abdu;Abdul-Quddus Mohammed;Lu Liu;Yawei Xu;Wenliang Che
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9528363/,[Angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction],"20 patients with acute myocardial infarction and a medical history of less than six hours were treated with immediate percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The median time from start of symptoms until establishment of reperfusion of the infarct related artery was 190 minutes, and the time from admission to insertion of the balloon was 52 minutes. Angioplasty was successful in all patients, with no serious complications. All patients experienced pain relief immediately after angioplasty. No patients died or had further infarctions. None needed hospitalization during the first three months of follow up. Eight patients had an exercise test between five and seven days after angioplasty and the other 12 at their six-week check up; there were no signs of ischemia or anginal pain. Measurement of global ejection fraction one week and six weeks after treatment showed median normal values and no significant changes (58% versus 57%). Myocardial perfusion imaging was carried out in eight patients both before hospital discharge and six weeks later. Normalization and improvement was seen in six patients using this method, whereas the perfusion was found unaltered in two patients. Hibernation or stunning, or both are suggested as possible explanations for this. We found the method highly effective and safe in selected patients.",,A Mangschau;B Bendz;M Rostrup;J Eritsland;C Müller;T O Kjellevand;M Brekke

Previous studies showed that the analysis of activity of creatinine kinase (CPK) measured in regular, short periods of time after thrombolysis night be useful in the diagnosis of reperfusion equally to coronary angiography. The aim of the study was to estimate the usefulness of the analysis of creatine kinase (CPK) and its isoenzyme (CK-MB) in the diagnosis of coronary reperfusion in patients with acute myocardial infarction after thrombolytic therapy. The study was performed in 50 patients with acute myocardial infarction admitted to our Cardiology Department, of these 42 were men aged from 34 to 68 and 8 were women aged from 43 to 70. 28 patients had acute inferior myocardial infarction, 22 patients--acute anterior myocardial infarction. All patients were administered 300 mg of aspirin after admission and then 150 mg of aspirin daily and 1,500,000 IU of streptokinase i.v. within 1 hour. Venous blood samples for determination of CPK and CK-MB were obtained every 3 hours during the first 48 h and once a day at 8 a.m from 3rd to 11th day. All patients underwent coronary angiography 2-4 weeks after thrombolysis. The study showed that in patients with reperfusion, activities of CPK and CK-MB three hours after thrombolysis were higher than 30% of later peak. These findings show the usefulness of this criterion in early, non-invasive estimation of efficacy of thrombolysis. Determination of activity of isoenzyme CK-MB during thrombolytic therapy is not necessary, because it evaluates similarly to CPK. We showed that electrocardiographic and enzymatic criteria are comparable in estimation of efficacy of thrombolytic therapy.",,A Mysiak;P Salomon;B Halawa

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24187805/,Phase II cardiac rehabilitation in rural Northland,"Cardiovascular disease has been identified as a leading cause of mortality in New Zealand. It is therefore of little surprise that the New Zealand Health Strategy has identified cardiovascular health as a target area for improved management. A main contributor to cardiovascular disease is coronary artery disease, which can lead to acute coronary syndromes such as myocardial infarction. Cardiac rehabilitation should be offered to those who have suffered from a coronary event, with the aim of improving quality of life for the client and reducing the incidence of further cardiac episodes. Since hospital stays are, on average, less than one week following a cardiac event such as a myocardial infarction, the majority of such rehabilitation is delivered in the primary care setting. This descriptive, exploratory, qualitative study focused on the perceptions and experiences of nurses involved with the delivery of cardiac rehabilitation in a rural health care setting in a Northland region of New Zealand. The paper draws upon two focus groups the researcher conducted with a total of twelve nurses. A general inductive approach was used to analyse the collected data. Five main themes were identified in relation to cardiac rehabilitation: ""foundations of rural cardiac rehabilitation"", ""focal points"", ""influencing factors"", ""here and now"", and ""future requirements"". This study provides insight into how cardiac rehabilitation is approached in one rural setting of New Zealand. Furthermore, it identifies some ideas for the further development of cardiac rehabilitation services.",,Catherine Beasley;Robyn Dixon

The aim of our study was to compare the diagnosis of AMI by the MONICA diagnostic criteria and by the modified criteria developed within the FINMONICA study with hospital discharge (clinical) diagnosis. In a series of 1565 suspected acute CHD events treated at Kuopio University Hospital in 1987-1990, a diagnosis of definite AMI was made clinically in 566 events and by the MONICA (and FINMONICA) criteria in 551 events. The comparability between clinical and MONICA (and FINMONICA) classifications was good (kappa 0.81, Ppos 0.88, Pneg 0.93). A diagnosis of definite or possible AMI was made clinically in 734 events, in 1249 events by the MONICA criteria (kappa 0.25, Ppos 0.69, Pneg 0.47) and in 934 events by the FINMONICA criteria (kappa 0.60, Ppos 0.81, Pneg 0.77). Of the 383 events classified as possible AMI by the FINMONICA criteria the clinical diagnosis was ""prolonged angina pectoris attack"" or ""unstable angina"" in 39%.

Reinfarction occurred in 28 of 364 (7.7%) patients in Group 1 and 14 of 733 (1.9%) in Group 2 (P less than 0.005).

In both groups, patients with associated congestive heart failure had a higher reinfarction rate. Patients who had intraoperative hypertension and tachycardia or hypotension develop had a higher incidence of reinfarction in both groups. The results suggest that preoperative optimization of the patient's status, aggressive invasive monitoring of the hemodynamic status, and prompt treatment of any hemodynamic aberration may be associated with decreased perioperative morbidity and mortality in patients with previous myocardial infarction.

IE and VR are demonstrated by echocardiography, and are usually seen with large, transmural, anterior AMI, hypertension and persisting occlusion of the infarct-related coronary artery. All myocardial tissue components are involved in IE and VR, and local generation of growth factors, vasoactive mediators, oxygen-derived free radicals, and activation of the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system may have pathophysiological significance.

The purpose of this study was to observe how LV wall motion abnormally is related to these variables. Twenty age-matched patients without overt heart disease were also studied as a control group. QT and QT max in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were markedly prolonged compared to those in normal controls (472.8 +/- 48.0, 483.2 +/- 32.1 vs 390.2 +/- 18.8, and 418.0 +/- 21.0 msec, respectively). QT dispersion and QTc dispersion in patients with AMI were significantly more prolonged than in normal controls (111.2 +/- 33.9, (113.4 +/- 32.9 vs 54.3 +/- 15.0, and 60.3 +/- 17.2 msec, respectively). QT dispersion has a positive correlation with QT max in AMI patients. Ejection fraction (EF) of the left ventricle was relatively well maintained in cases where only one segment of the left anterior ventricular wall was impaired in its motion. It decreased, however, in accordance with the extent of wall motion abnormality QT max and QTc max were prolonged as the number of LV wall segments with impairment increased. This, however, was not statistically significant. QT dispersion and QTc dispersion had no relation to the extent of LV wall motion abnormality nor to EF of the left ventricle In conclusion, no definite relationships between QT dispersion (QTc dispersion) and EF of the left ventricle, or between these variables and the extent of left ventricular wall motion abnormality were found in patients with anterior myocardial infarction in our study. Although both QT max and QT dispersion were prolonged in patients with myocardial infarction, this suggests that electrical heterogeneity or regional variation in electrical ventricular recovery did not always parallel the severity of mechanical abnormality of the left ventricle.",,Y Doi;K Takada;H Mihara;T Kawano;O Nakagaki;S Ogawa;K Arakawa
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18803426/,Molecular signatures of cardiovascular disease risk: potential for test development and clinical application,"Most cardiovascular diseases are multifactorial by etiology. As an example, the development of myocardial infarction is promoted by numerous risk factors, ranging from rather modifiable lifestyle habits (e.g. smoking, physical activity) to genetic predisposition. With respect to the latter, 15 years of candidate gene analyses have failed to explain the molecular basis for the genetic predisposition to myocardial infarction. By contrast, recent genome-wide association studies have identified chromosomal loci that reproducibly displayed some association with myocardial infarction risk. When molecular genetic studies of coronary artery disease were first begun, it was assumed that genetic factors would soon be routinely incorporated into risk prediction scores. A number of biomarkers have been identified and tested in combination with the classical risk factors for refined risk prediction. However, the strategy for individualized risk prediction by incorporation of new biomarkers in established scores has so far proven to be more difficult than at first hoped.",,Heribert Schunkert;Inke R König;Jeanette Erdmann

Subjects were categorized as; Group I (n = 18), with inferior myocardial infarction and single vessel disease without (n = 11; Ia) and with (n = 7; Ib) exercise-induced precordial ST depression and group II (n = 10), inferior myocardial infarction with multivessel disease. The subjects were examined using 12-lead exercise ECG, stress T1-201 myocardial imaging and stress radionuclide ventriculography. Compared to group Ia, exercise-induced precordial ST depression in group Ib was associated with extensive infarction extending into the inferoseptal left ventricular wall by T1-201 myocardial imaging. Worsening of septal wall motion was also more frequently observed on stress radionuclide ventriculography. For detecting multivessel disease in prior inferior myocardial infarction, exercise ECG and radionuclide ventriculography had poor specificity and predictive value compared to stress T1-201 myocardial imaging. We conclude that exercise-induced precordial ST depression observed in patients with prior inferior myocardial infarction due to single vessel disease reflects a peri-infarction ischemia in the inferoseptal wall of the left ventricle. Great caution is necessary when predicting multivessel disease in prior inferior myocardial infarction using exercise ECG.

The present study was conducted, therefore, to evaluate the effects of angioplasty following administration of conventional thrombolytic agents on the long-term prognosis of acute myocardial infarction patients. A total of 409 patients admitted to the hospital within 12 hours of the onset of infarction between January 1990 and May 2001 were studied retrospectively. These included 151 patients treated with thrombolysis alone (group T), 73 patients treated with angioplasty alone (group A), and 35 patients treated with angioplasty after thrombolysis (group T&A). Group T&A had shorter intervals from onset to initial treatment than group A (3.0 hours vs 6.3 hours, p < 0.01), a higher reperfusion success rate than group T (91.4% vs 74.8%, p < 0.01), and more improved left ventricular wall motion than group A. One-year cardiac mortality rates tended to be higher in group T, which had a higher rate of unsuccessful reperfusion than groups T&A or A (8.1% vs 3.4% vs 3.5%).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/252510/,The clinical importance of coronary arteriography after myocardial infarction,"An analysis of 80 patients who had elective coronary arteriography within 6 months after hospital dismissal for acute myocardial infarction showed that approximately two-thirds had multivessel coronary disease. The study is consistent with others reported in the recent literature in suggesting that most patients who survive myocardial infarction have multivessel disease. High early and late post-myocardial infarction mortality is comparable to that described for patients with two- and three-vessel occlusive disease. Knowledge of specific coronary anatomy and left ventricular function is critical in assessing post-myocardial infarction prognosis.

Fifty-seven patients were examined 2 weeks and approximately 1 year after AMI by a radionuclide method allowing determination of absolute LV volumes. After 1 year the patients had fewer clinical and radiologic signs of heart failure, but median end-diastolic volume index had increased from 92 to 112 ml/m2 (p less than 0.001), median end-systolic volume index from 51 to 65 ml/m2 (p less than 0.001) and median stroke volume index from 39 to 47 ml/m2 (p less than 0.001). Patients with first anterior infarcts had significantly greater increases in end-diastolic volume index, end-systolic volume index and stroke volume index than patients with first inferoposterior infarcts. The increase in LV volumes was significantly greater in patients with clinical manifestations of heart failure than in those without these signs.

Failure to reperfuse is associated with an increased short- and long-term mortality. In a prospective study we used dynamic vectorcardiography to monitor 96 patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with reperfusion therapy to non-invasively assess coronary patency. The results from continuous monitoring were compared to those obtained from angiography. By using trend-analysis of QRS vector difference and ST vector magnitude, we were able to correctly identify 58 of the 70 patients (83%) with a reperfused infarct-related artery, and 19 of the 26 patients (73%) with a persistently occluded artery demonstrated at an early angiogram (diagnostic accuracy 80%). In patients with high-grade collateral flow to the infarct-related area, the results of the vectorcardiographic monitoring and of angiography showed the largest disagreement, whereas the accuracy of vectorcardiographic monitoring was high: 88% among patients without collaterals. The present results suggest that QRS complex and ST segment vectorcardiographic monitoring is a useful tool for assessing early coronary artery patency, and that dynamic vectorcardiography may help in identifying candidates for emergency coronary angiography.",,M Dellborg;P G Steg;M Simoons;R Dietz;S Sen;M van den Brand;U Lotze;S Hauck;R van den Wieken;D Himbert

Herein we describe such a patient, in whom serial tomographic imaging with a new radiopharmaceutical agent, technetium-99m sestamibi, was useful in demonstrating a large area of myocardium at risk and subsequent substantial benefit from acute reperfusion therapy. Because this perfusion agent washes out slowly from the myocardium, imaging can be delayed for several hours; thus, acute reperfusion therapy can be performed without delay. Subsequent imaging, however, will reflect myocardial perfusion at the time of administration of the radionuclide. Additional studies with this agent may be valuable in identifying those patients with ST-segment depression who will benefit from acute reperfusion therapy.",,P A Pellikka;T Behrenbeck;K C Huber;R J Gibbons

A 63-year-old woman became progressively more short of breath 4 days after an acute episode of chest pain accompanied by nausea and sweating. It proved to be a cardiogenic shock following a rupture of a papillary muscle. A man aged 65 collapsed 5 days after an episode of back pain and nausea. This was a cardiac tamponade due to rupture of the left ventricle. A woman aged 74 had transient aphasia and during investigations for this was seen to have anomalies on ECG. She had cerebral emboli and a cardiac aneurysm with associated thrombus. All 3 patients recovered following mitral-valve replacement, repair of the rupture and medicinal treatment for the clot, respectively. Around one-third of patients who have a myocardial infarction do not have chest pain but experience shortness of breath, autonomic nervous symptoms (sweating, nausea, vomiting), extreme and inexplicable tiredness and fainting.

In the present study, the wall motion abnormalities of 34 patients with Q wave MI and eight patients with non-Q wave MI, all with isolated left anterior descending artery (LAD) lesion, were compared using left ventriculography and two-dimensional echocardiography. This study clearly demonstrated that the severity and distribution of asynergy were significantly greater in patients with Q wave MI than in those with non-Q wave MI. Akinesis or dyskinesis was observed in all 34 patients (100%) (151 of 544 segments) with Q wave MI, and in four of eight patients (50%) (eight of 128 segments) with non-Q wave MI (p less than 0.05). Apical aneurysm occurred exclusively in patients with Q wave MI. In non-Q wave MI, asynergy was localized at the papillary muscle level or the apex. At the chordal level, asynergy was observed in only one of eight cases with non-Q wave MI, and in 24 of 34 cases with Q wave MI (p less than 0.05).

The T wave of the magnetocardiogram (MCG) in the control group showed negative deflections in the left upper portion and positive deflections in the right lower portion, thus resulting in a T vector directed leftward and inferiorly. The T wave of the IMI group was flat or positive in the left upper portion and flat or negative in the right lower portion, suggesting a T vector directed superiorly. In addition, opposing dipoles were observed in 36.4% of the IMI group; i.e. one directed superiorly, presumably due to inferior myocardial ischaemia, and the other directed inferiorly due to normal repolarization. Localized T vector abnormalities could be detected by the MCG in some cases, in which coronary T waves of the standard electrocardiogram had returned to normal. Furthermore, multiple dipoles were more frequently observed in the isomagnetic map than in the isopotential map (5 vs. 15; P less than 0.01).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30523422/,Inflammatory cells and their non-coding RNAs as targets for treating myocardial infarction,"Myocardial infarction triggers infiltration of several types of immune cells that coordinate both innate and adaptive immune responses. These play a dual role in post-infarction cardiac remodeling by initiating and resolving inflammatory processes, which needs to occur in a timely and well-orchestrated way to ensure a reestablishment of normalized cardiac functions. Thus, therapeutic modulation of immune responses might have benefits for infarct patients. While such strategies have shown great potential in treating cancer, applications in the post-infarction context have been disappointing. One challenge has been the complexity and plasticity of immune cells and their functions in cardiac regulation and healing. The types appear in patterns that are temporally and spatially distinct, while influencing each other and the surrounding tissue. A comprehensive understanding of the immune cell repertoire and their regulatory functions following infarction is sorely needed. Processes of cardiac remodeling trigger additional genetic changes that may also play critical roles in the aftermath of cardiovascular disease. Some of these changes involve non-coding RNAs that play crucial roles in the regulation of immune cells and may, therefore, be of therapeutic interest. This review summarizes what is currently known about the functions of immune cells and non-coding RNAs during post-infarction wound healing. We address some of the challenges that remain and describe novel therapeutic approaches under development that are based on regulating immune responses through non-coding RNAs in the aftermath of the disease.",Immune response; Inflammation; Lymphocyte; Macrophage; Myocardial infarction; Neutrophil; Therapeutic strategy.,Mira Jung;Michael Dodsworth;Thomas Thum

Unlike pharmaceutical trials, which receive $30-50 million in research funds, virtually all trials of PTCA have been unfunded. Nevertheless, several groups have conclusively proved the benefit of primary PTCA over thrombolysis. In a 1995 meta-analysis, PTCA proved superior to thrombolytic therapy in reducing death and reinfarction. The Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO-IIB) substudy confirmed this fact with 94% certainly. Other studies were designed to refine the angioplasty technique. In the Primary Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (PAMI-I) study, acute catheterization was used to stratify patients and identified a low-risk population whose mortality equaled that of patients treated electively. Compared with clinical risk factors, angiographic findings enhanced the power to predict mortality three-fold. The high-risk subset with acute myocardial infarction (MI) was also randomized to treatment with or without prophylactic intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP). Although IABP caused no complications, it had no positive effect on primary endpoints (death, recurrent MI, and reocclusion) and did not improve left ventricular function at 6 months. One limitation of primary PTCA is a high rate of late restenosis (30-50% at 6 months). In a pilot study we are examining the role of stents in conjunction with primary PTCA. Early results indicate that in the 69% of patients eligible for stent placement, in-hospital events were uncommon (no deaths, no reinfarctions, low rate of recurrent ischemia) and the need for repeat revascularization was infrequent.",,C L Grines

Preoperatively confirmed cases of STEMI (n = 150) were included in the analysis. There were 114 survivors and 36 nonsurvivors. In-hospital mortality rate was 22%. In Cox regression analysis age, cardiogenic shock (Killip ≥3), preoperative cardiac troponin levels, preoperative use of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP), previous myocardial infarction, and percutaneous coronary intervention were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. After multivariate analysis, factors predicting in-hospital mortality were age, preoperative cardiac troponin levels, and preoperative IABP. Age, preoperative cardiac troponin levels, and preoperative IABP use were predictive factors of in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing primary CABG for STEMI.",,Ugur Filizcan;Erol Kurc;Sebnem Cetemen;Ozer Soylu;Hakki Aydogan;Olgar Bayserke;Muruvvet Yilmaz;Huseyin Uyarel;Mehmet Ergelen;Gokcen Orhan;Murat Ugurlucan;Ergin Eren;Ibrahim Yekeler

Such electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern has been associated heretofore with the hyperacute phase of an anterior MI, and unstable, and variant angina, although it is found in illustrations of many previous publications in conjunction with inferior MI. The GRWs, along with ST-segment elevations, were noted transiently in the inferior ECG leads, early in the clinical course of our patient. Subsequent evolution of the ECG revealed classic appearances for an inferior MI. Cardiac enzymes, and thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy revealed evidence for inferiorly-located myocardial necrosis. Coronary arteriography showed stenosis of the right coronary artery, for which the patient underwent an uneventful angioplasty and ""stenting"" of the culprit vessel.

Fear of resumption of sexual activity was expressed by 51% of the patients and 44% of the husbands. Sexual activity was not resumed by 27%, was unchanged by 27%, and was decreased by 44%. Only 45% of the total group received sexual instructions before discharge, and in only 18% of cases did the physician raise the topic. Symptoms during intercourse were reported by 57% of the patients. Myocardial infarction has a negative impact on the sexuality of the female patient, and although many patients who have had myocardial infarction desire sexual counseling, their demands are still not being met.

More than three fourths of all cases of myocardial infarction appear outside the hospital. After three months the lethality is 60%, whereby the half of all cases of death appears already in the prehospital phase. More than 8 hours are passing before half of all patients with infarction are admitted into the hospital. The greatest retardation takes place between arrival of the physician and admission into the hospital. In the second place follows the interval onset of the infarction and demand of medical aid. An improvement of the early diagnostics and the transport of the patient as well as an adequate information and collaboration of the patient and his surroundings might contribute to a shortening of the prehospital phase and thus to a decrease of the early mortality in cases of myocardial infarction.",,R Aurisch;S Böthig;I Schneider;H Schaedel;J Knappe;C Markgraf

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22578238/,Role of the inflammasome in myocardial infarction,"Inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of myocardial infarction (MI). In particular, reperfusion caused by increased thrombolytic activity or revascularization therapy may restore the coronary blood flow and reduce the infarct size, but it also simultaneously enhances the inflammatory response and causes harmful effects on the myocardium-a process termed ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. The inflammasome is a large multiprotein complex that is formed in the cytosol in response to danger signals; it drives the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β. Increasing evidence indicates that the inflammasome is a key player in the disease processes of sterile inflammation. In particular, IL-1β is a prominent and early mediator of inflammation in I/R injury, suggesting the importance of the inflammasome in myocardial I/R injury. This article reviews the role of the inflammasome in the development of myocardial I/R injury and discusses the potential of the inflammasome as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of myocardial I/R injury.",,Masafumi Takahashi

The difference in the course and prognosis of primary and recurrent microfocal myocardial infarction is determined. It is shown that microfocal myocardial infarction as a form of exacerbation of ischemic heart disease is characterized by a complex of syndromes differing from the typical picture of marcrofocal myocardial infarction. As compared to macrofocal myocardial infarction, the course of the disease after microfocal myocardial infarction is characterized by more frequent exacerbations of coronary insufficiency and a greater tendency toward the development of recurrent myocardial infarction. In some cases, microfocal myocardial infarction heralds the development of macrofocal myocardial infarction with a severe course and high mortality rate, which provides the grounds for the conclusion that patients with microfocal myocardial infarction have a lower coronary reserve.",,V G Popov;N K Rozova;N A Pogrebnaia;L D Meshalkin;L V Suvorova

The number of these admissions has been constantly rising from 226 in 1982 to 397 in 1992. Over 45 years of age were 3043 (90.8%) of the patients (70% males and 30% females), while 309 of them (9.2%) were under 45 (93% males, 7% females). The lethality rate was 21% in the first and 8% in the second subgroup. In patients over 45 inferior myocardial infarction was found in 35%, and in patients under 45 in 49%.

Direct cardiovascular protective properties have therefore been proposed, and studied in preclinical models of myocardial infarction. We now aim to critically assess the quality and outcome of these studies. We present a systematic review, quality assessment and meta-analysis of the effect of metformin in animal studies of experimental myocardial infarction. Through a comprehensive search in Pubmed and EMBASE, we identified 27 studies, 11 reporting on ex vivo experiments and 18 reporting on in vivo experiments. The primary endpoint infarct size as percentage of area at risk was significantly reduced by metformin in vivo (MD -18.11[-24.09,-12.14]) and ex vivo (MD -18.70[-25.39, -12.02]). Metformin improved the secondary endpoints left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular end systolic diameter. A borderline significant effect on mortality was observed, and there was no overall effect on cardiac hypertrophy. Subgroup analyses could be performed for comorbidity and timing of treatment (infarct size and mortality) and species and duration of ischemia (LVEF), but none of these variables accounted for significant amounts of heterogeneity. Reporting of possible sources of bias was extremely poor, including randomization (reported in 63%), blinding (33%), and sample size calculation (0%). As a result, risk of bias (assessed using SYRCLE's risk of bias tool) was unclear in the vast majority of studies. We conclude that metformin limits infarct-size and improves cardiac function in animal models of myocardial infarction, but our confidence in the evidence is lowered by the unclear risk of bias and residual unexplained heterogeneity. We recommend an adequately powered, high quality confirmatory animal study to precede a randomized controlled trial of acute administration of metformin in patients undergoing reperfusion for acute myocardial infarction.",,Nienke A Hesen;Niels P Riksen;Bart Aalders;Michelle AE Brouwer;Merel Ritskes-Hoitinga;Saloua El Messaoudi;Kimberley E Wever

The CATS Investigators Group,"To recognize patients prone to subsequent left ventricular dilation after the acute phase of a myocardial infarction treated with thrombolysis, we studied 233 patients with a first anterior infarction, treated with thrombolysis, with 2-dimensional echocardiography within 12 hours after admission and 3 months later. A wall motion score index (WMSI) and left ventricular volumes were assessed, and enzymatic infarct size was expressed as cumulative alphahydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase determined in the first 72 hours after infarction. Patients who died (17 of 233, 7%) after a mean follow-up of 517 days had a significantly higher acute WMSI (2.1 +/- 0.3, mean +/- SD) than those who survived (1.9 +/- 0.4)(p=0.006). With use of this cutoff value for 2 WMSI, ventricles with an acute WMSI < or = 2 (62%) showed no increase in end-diastolic volume index (EDVI) or end-systolic volume index (ESVI), whereas ventricles with an acute WMSI >2 (38%) showed a significant increase in ESVI (6.1 +/- 12.2 ml/m2) and in EDVI (10.3 +/- 16.6 ml/m2) in the first 3 months. Using a cutoff value of 1,000 U/L for cumulative alphahydroxybutytrate dehydrogenase, only infarcts with a value of >1,000 U/L (52%) caused a significant increase in EDVI (10.8 +/- 14.3 ml/m2) and ESVI (6.5 +/- 10.0 ml/m2) in the first 3 months. Thus, acutely assessed WMSI of >2 can readily predict subsequent dilation in patients with a first anterior infarction treated with streptokinase and is a good predictor of mortality.

The present work used the same clinical reports, collected by the Medical Emergency Assistance System (SAMU) in the Paris area from 1975 to 1977, but with multivariate calculations. 150 potential predictive indicators were submitted to ""progressive ascending selection"". Selected indicators were then combined into a composite index by ""linear canonic discrimination"". This index was tested in terms of successful prediction. The 150 indicators were: 1) meteorological variables, recorded at ground level, such as wind and temperature (expressed respectively in 28 and 24 ways), airpressure, moisture; 2) variables computed from data recorded in altitude; 3) pollutants; 4) non-meteorological indicators, such as day of the week, season, solar activity; 5) the ""past of the predictand"", i.e. the frequency of infarctions during the previous days; 6) types of weather, defined after confronting meteorological maps with clinical data. The coding of qualitative data required a new procedure. The event to be predicted, which occurred only one day a week, was an incidence of infarctions of at least twice the average. The percentage of successful prediction was 78.7%. The type of weather was by far the best indicator. Detrimental circumstances were changing weathers, with in the order of decreasing correlations, atmosphere fluxes coming from S-SE, E, SW, and NW. These results complete those of univariate analysis.

After 15 years of research in the experimental laboratory, some evidence shows the existence of preconditioning in human patients with coronary artery disease: repeated balloon inflations before coronary angioplasty induce preconditioning-like effects; moreover, some studies demonstrate better clinical outcome in patients with angina before acute myocardial infarction, resembling a preconditioning effect. So far, a few drugs have been identified as potential mediators of preconditioning, e.g., adenosine, adenosine receptor agonists, and adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel openers. Before coronary angioplasty and heart surgery, these preconditioning mimetics might be used to protect myocardial tissue by means of preconditioning. Further research is required before preconditioning mimetics could be used for therapy in patients with chronic myocardial ischemia.

In all 16 patients with anterior infarction, regional ejection fraction, a quantitative measure of regional left ventricular performance, was uniformly depressed in the infarcted zone. In patients with inferior infarction the abnormalities of regional performance were less severe. Fourteen of 20 patients (70 percent) with inferior infarction had depressed performance in the infarcted zone. Function in noninfarcted zones was abnormal in only 6 of the 20 patients (30 percent) with inferior infarction, but it was abnormal in 11 of the 16 patients (69 percent) with anterior infarction, particularly in those with severe pump failure. As a consequence, global left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly lower in patients with anterior than in those with inferior infarction (mean +/- standard error of the mean 31 +/- 3 percent versus 51 +/- 3 percent, less than 0.005). Prognosis and clinical functional class were related to performance not only in infarcted zones, but also in noninfarcted zones as assessed with electrocardiography.

The result depends both on the duration of ischemia and the presence of collaterals. By early initiation of intravenous thrombolytic therapy and shortening the ischemic period, the functional results may be improved. PTCA has to be considered in order to avoid reocclusion of the infarct vessel, mainly in patients with high-grade residual stenosis and viable myocardium in the poststenotic area. The benefit of early thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction has been proven in randomized trials.

Cineangiocardiography revealed that patients with anterior infarction (n = 25) had both poorer left ventricular function and more totally occluded vessels than those with either inferior (n = 33) or subendocardial infarction (n = 20). In contrast, patients with inferior and subendocardial infarction had a greater proportion of myocardium supplied by sub-total lesions likely to be haemodynamically significant (75%-99% cross sectional area loss). Subendocardial infarction was also characterised by the best left ventricular function and the fewest number of total coronary occlusions. Stress testing showed that the combination of ischaemic ST segment changes and angina during exercise was 91% predictive of severe coronary disease (equivalent to triple vessel disease) while no angina in the presence of a negative test was 81% predictive of mild or moderate disease. Stenoses of 75%-99% cross sectional area loss were more common when angina occurred during exercise testing, and both angina and ischaemic ST segment changes occurred within ten minutes in all four patients with haemodynamically significant left main coronary artery lesions.

Recent data suggest that a similar effect of PGI2 may occur also in humans with acute myocardial infarction. We addressed the hypothesis that PGI2 redistributes myocardial blood flow following coronary ligation, and that this effect favours perfusion of myocardium at risk and thereby limits infarct size. Following ligation of a distal branch of the left coronary artery in anaesthetized dogs, PGI2 (2-4 ng/kg/min) was infused for 72 h. Regional myocardial blood flow was assessed immediately after the coronary ligation and at the end of the drug infusion, by injection of 57Co- and 113Sn-labelled microspheres, respectively. Coronary ligation reduced regional coronary blood flow by 40-70%. During the subsequent 72 h the blood flow increased, being at the end of the period 50-70% of the flow in the non-ischaemic myocardium. PGI2 did not affect the spontaneous improvement of regional myocardial blood flow, as assessed at the end of the infusion. PGI2 also failed to affect infarct size, either when expressed in relation to total left ventricular mass, or in relation to area at risk. We conclude that PGI2, when infused immediately after coronary ligation in dogs in a clinically relevant dose, neither affects regional myocardial blood flow in the ischaemic regions, nor the size of the myocardial infarction.",,K Herbaczynska-Cedro;E Karwatowska-Prokopczuk;J Michalowski;A Wennmalm

This review examines the clinical trials of insulin infusion for myocardial infarction in the era of reperfusion therapy, and discusses the implications of the recently completed HI-5 (Hyperglycaemia: Intensive Insulin Infusion In Infarction) study. The clinical trials of insulin therapy for myocardial infarction can be divided into those with a primary aim of delivering insulin (insulin focus), and those with a primary aim of achieving tight glycaemic control (glycaemia focus). The evidence suggests that protocols with an insulin focus do not improve the outcome of myocardial infarction. However, the trials with a glycaemia focus are inconclusive and it remains possible that glycaemic control is beneficial.",,N Wah Cheung;Vincent W Wong;Mark McLean

Over the last decade, stem cells have been a promise for the cure of several diseases not only due to their plasticity but also to their capacity to act in a paracrine manner and influence the affected tissue, prompting the launching of several clinical trials.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9593569/,Thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction,"Thrombolytic therapy has been a major advance in the management of acute myocardial infarction. Unfortunately, it continues to be underused or is administered later than is optimal. Thrombolytic therapy works by lysing infarct artery thrombi and achieving reperfusion, thereby reducing infarct size, preserving left ventricular function, and improving survival. The most effective thrombolytic regimens achieve angiographic epicardial infarct-artery patency in only approximately 50% of patients within 90 minutes. Bleeding requiring transfusion occurs in approximately 5% of patients and stroke in approximately 1.8% with these regimens, which include adjunctive aspirin and intravenous heparin. There are several ways in which reperfusion rates and thus patient outcomes might be improved, such as different dosing regimens of established agents; combinations of different agents; improved adjunctive therapy such as direct antithrombin agents, low-molecular-weight heparin, or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists; or the development of novel thrombolytic agents with enhanced fibrin specificity, resistance to native inhibitors, or prolonged half-lives allowing bolus administration. All of these strategies are being tested in clinical trials. The best approach currently is to administer thrombolytic therapy as soon as possible to all patients without contraindications who present within 12 hours of symptom onset and have ST-segment elevation on the ECG or new-onset left bundle-branch block, unless an alternative reperfusion strategy is planned.",,H D White;F J Van de Werf
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2382607/,Recovery of regional myocardial dysfunction after successful coronary angioplasty early after a non-Q wave myocardial infarction,"More aggressive therapy has been suggested for patients who have a non-Q wave myocardial infarction (MI) because of the frequency of subsequent unstable angina, recurrent MI, and high mortality rate compared to patients with Q wave MI. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of coronary angioplasty on regional myocardial function of the infarct zone in patients with angina early after a non-Q wave MI. The study population consisted of 36 patients undergoing successful coronary angioplasty within 30 days of a non-Q wave MI, in whom sequential left ventricular angiograms of adequate quality were obtained before the initial procedure and at follow-up angiography. The global ejection fraction increased significantly from 60 +/- 9% to 67 +/- 6% (p = 0.0003). This significant increase in the global ejection fraction was primarily due to a significant improvement in the regional myocardial function of the infarct zone. The results of the present study show not only that ischemic attacks early after a non-Q wave MI may lead to prolonged regional myocardial dysfunction but more important that this depressed myocardium has the potential to achieve normal contraction after successful coronary angioplasty.",,H Suryapranata;P W Serruys;K Beatt;P J De Feyter;M van den Brand;J Roelandt

In patients with ST elevation AMI (n = 412), the groups with QRS duration > or =100 ms and <100 ms had similar survival. Conversely, in patients with non-ST elevation AMI (n = 369), in-hospital, 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival was 84.4%, 75.6%, 66.7%, and 52.2%, respectively, in the group with QRS > or =100 ms compared with 95.4%, 89.2%, 83.8%, and 74.3%, respectively, in the group with QRS <100 ms (p <0.01, log-rank test). In patients with non-ST elevation AMI, those with QRS duration > or =100 ms were more likely to be men, to have had a prior AMI that healed, to be in Killip class II, III, or IV, and to have lower ejection fraction than patients with QRS duration <100 ms. After adjusting for age, sex, prior AMI or stroke, heart rate, and Killip class on admission, QRS duration > or =100 ms was independently associated with in-hospital and overall mortality in patients with non-ST elevation AMI.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16226099/,Prehospital evaluation in ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention,"In patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, fast initiation of reperfusion therapy is mandatory. It is well established that prehospital diagnosis results in earlier initiation of fibrinolysis, but there is limited evidence concerning the value of prehospital evaluation in patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The present paper proposes various prehospital strategies that may be of relevance in treating the latter patients: (1) a substantial reduction in treatment delay may be achieved by prehospital diagnosis, especially if combined with rerouting of patients directly to interventional hospital; (2) use of telemedicine may allow a widespread implementation of a prehospital diagnostic program; (3) a rerouting strategy may result in prolonged transportation. In this setting, continuous real-time 1-lead ECG transmission from ambulance to hospital may allow physicians to support ambulance personnel in the treatment of arrhythmias during transportation; and (4) equipment used for prehospital ECG acquisition and transmission has built-in features for continuous ST-segment monitoring. It is hypothesized that continuous ST-segment monitoring performed in the prehospital phase and during primary PCI may provide important prognostic information, with the potential of triaging future pharmacological and interventional treatment at time of PCI.",,Christian Juhl Terkelsen;Bjarne Linde Nørgaard;Jens Flensted Lassen;Henning Rud Andersen

In the present study, we assessed the influence of early coronary reperfusion and coronary obstruction that remained after reperfusion on regional myocardial perfusion by myocardial contrast echocardiography. The study population consisted of 17 patients with acute myocardial infarction who underwent either successful PTCR or emergent PTCA within 6 hours after the onset of the symptom. Myocardial blood flow was visualized by selective injections of hand-agitated poly-gelin colloid solutions into the right and left coronary arteries before and after coronary reperfusion. Before coronary reperfusion, the area at risk for necrosis was defined as the area of contrast defects by the intracoronary injection of contrast medium. The size (severity) of this defect correlated with the anatomic distribution of the obstructed coronary artery. Immediately after emergent PTCA (mean residual stenosis = 25%), 2 of 10 patients still showed injected contrast medium, however, in the remaining 8 patients (80%), the contrast washout time in the risk area was 1.5 times (mean value) longer than that in the normal region. This indicated impairment of the microcirculation in the post-ischemic myocardium. Immediately after PTCR (mean residual stenosis = 89%, p < 0.01 vs PTCA), contrast enhancement was observed only in the peripheral region of the risk area; contrast defects at the center of this region were observed on contrast echocardiography after reperfusion for all patients. This showed that there was impairment of myocardial blood flow in the risk area, even after successful recanalization in patients undergoing PTCR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,H Ito;T Tomooka;N Akehi;N Sakai;Y Higashino;K Fujii;O Kato;T Minamino

In particular, myocardial perfusion imaging provides important data on infarct size and myocardial viability that can help determine the best treatment strategies for patients with acute MI. First-pass or blood pool radionuclide angiographic assessment of ventricular ejection fraction remains an important prognostic indicator in acute MI, regardless of whether thrombolytic therapy is used. Comparative studies of radiotracer techniques and coronary angiography show that myocardial perfusion and ejection fraction can predict the risk of future cardiac events reliably in patients with acute MI, whereas the anatomic data provided by coronary angiography (e.g., degree of stenosis and presence of multivessel disease) have little prognostic value. Managed-care organizations could reduce costs and improve patient outcomes by relying more on nuclear cardiology and less on angiography in the management of patients' with acute MI.",,M S Verani

Oxygen uptake at peak exercise increased 42% and heart rate at rest was significantly decreased after training. Increases were found in the magnitude of the R waves in leads II, aVF and V4 to V6; of the S wave in leads V1 and V3; of the T waves in V5 and V6; and of the Sokolow index of QRS voltage. Also, the magnitude of the mean electrical vector in the frontal plane was significantly higher after training. These data were compared with those derived from two electrocardiographic tracings, separated by an average of 19 +/- 1.5 weeks, of 20 other patients with an inferior myocardial infarction who were comparable in age, weight, risk factor and delay between infarction and first examination, but who were not trained. When the electrocardiographic changes between the two observations were compared for the two groups, the trained patients show significant increases in the magnitude of the R wave in the left precordial leads, and leads II and aVF and the Sokolow voltage criterion; in the magnitude of the T wave in leads V5 and V6; and in the magnitude of the mean electrical vector in the frontal plane.

To investigate clinical outcome and possibly identify high-risk subgroups 131 consecutive patients (pts) meeting diagnostic criteria for nQMI, admitted to our CCU for their first myocardial infarction between January 1980 and June 1985, were followed-up for a mean period of 34 months (range 6-72). Mean age of pts was 59 +/- 7 yrs; 101 (76%) were males, 30 (24%) females. No pt was lost to follow-up. During the same period 684 pts were admitted for Q wave myocardial infarction. Major coronary events such as angina, reinfarction, CBS, cardiac death as well as overall early and late mortality were considered for statistical evaluation with uni-multivariate analysis taking into account multiple data from pts history and acute clinical presentation. Angina appeared or recurred in 71 pts (54%), reinfarction occurred in 14 (10.7%); 25 pts underwent CBC (19%).

Electrocardiographic short term and long term results using precordial mapping,"In a consecutive series of 56 patients with acute myocardial infarction, ST segment depression and elevation in the electrocardiographic limb leads I, II, and III were summated for each patient before and immediately after intracoronary streptokinase infusion and the results compared with the angiographic findings. Forty three patients had angiographically confirmed reperfusion of an initially occluded vessel and showed a significant decrease in summated ST shift. The ST segment changes in the limb leads virtually returned to normal in all 43 patients, and in most, inverted T waves developed. Thrombolysis was unsuccessful in 10 patients, and the infarct related coronary artery was already patent in three. When these two groups are combined, all 13 patients without reperfusion showed no significant change in summated ST segment shift. During percutaneous transluminal angioplasty inflation of the balloon in the vessel that was previously occluded simulated reocclusion and was followed by new ST elevation if the artery supplied viable myocardium. In a further consecutive study of 54 patients with anterior myocardial infarction, the precordial R waves and Q waves were studied over the four to six months following infarction using a standardised 48 electrode mapping system. All patients underwent a repeat angiogram after four to six months. In 36 patients the infarct related vessel was patent. They showed a significant mean increase in summated precordial R wave amplitude and a reduction in the mean number of precordial leads without R waves. In 18 patients with unsuccessful thrombolysis or reocclusion there was a further reduction in mean summated R wave amplitude and an increased number of precordial leads not showing R waves. Precordial R wave mapping seems to be a valuable non-invasive method of assessing the salvage of myocardium after reperfusion and the damage caused by reocclusion.

Effect of size of injury,"The effects of the size of acute myocardial infarction on ventricular reentry and automaticity were studied in 36 mongrel dogs. Large transmural myocardial infarctions were produced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (major ligation; diameter of infarction above 4.0 cm), and small subendocardial or intramural infarctions were produced by ligating a small diagonal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery (minor ligation; diameter of infarction less than 1.5 cm). Reentrant arrhythmias were induced by rapid ventricular stimulation, and ventricular automaticity was determined during vagal stimulation. Ventricular automaticity became enhanced only 30 to 45 minutes after both major and minor coronary arterial ligations; however, the animals with major ligations attained a higher level of increased automaticity. While automaticity became enhanced in both groups reentrant arrhythmias could never be produced artificially (or observed spontaneously) in the animals with myocardial infarctions. The dependence of the so-called reentrant arrhythmias on the size of the infarction is a major support for the theory of reentry as the basis for these arrhythmias.",,E Kaplinsky;A Horowitz;H N Neufeld

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7774508/,Current management of acute myocardial infarction,"Acute myocardial infarction is a devastating cardiac clinical event, which is the result of progressive coronary arteriosclerosis. Coronary heart disease is a major health concern that accounts for a significant number of hospitalizations, health care expenditures, and deaths. Recent advancements in the nature and pathophysiology of progressive coronary disease and infarction have allowed us to curb the natural course of the disease, shorten hospital stays, and improve patient outcomes. Focused history taking and physical examination, with the assistance of the appropriate laboratory studies and an electrocardiogram, facilitate the rapid identification of a patient with myocardial infarction. Overall clinical results will be improved by minimizing the time from diagnosis to therapy. Several initial measures are readily available to the physician at the time of the patient's arrival in the hospital emergency room. Consideration regarding relief of pain, anticoagulation, and contraindications for thrombolytic therapy should accompany the initial evaluation. For patients in whom the diagnosis is in doubt, adjunctive confirmatory testing and imaging studies should be urgently sought. Elderly patients have a higher mortality rate from infarction, so an aggressive approach in this group of patients is warranted. Administration of thrombolytic therapy or primary angioplasty will be most efficacious in a majority of patients. The evolution of adjunctive medications will further improve efficacy and avoid reinfarction. Proper dosage and timing of adjunctive medications, along with dosage titration based on hemodynamic response, will facilitate the best possible results. Rapid restoration of flow down a suddenly occluded epicardial coronary vessel is the primary end point in therapy. With this in mind, there has been an increasing trend toward mechanical restoration of flow by means of primary angioplasty in centers where this technologic capability is available. Close attention to the patient's hemodynamic status along with rapid identification and therapy of peri-infarction arrhythmias will help to avoid clinical complications. When peripheral perfusion is compromised, hemodynamic monitoring, inotropic medications, and mechanical assistance may become necessary. Subsequent severe pump failure is usually the result of a devastating mechanical complication. Patients with mechanical complications have a high associated event-related mortality rate. Urgent identification of the nature of the complication with the use of invasive and noninvasive imaging studies, mechanical and inotropic assistance, and emergency surgical correction may be lifesaving.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,S M Smith

Myocardial infarction develops in 11% to 49% of these patients, with 18% to 46% of infarcts resulting in new Q waves. Since February 1987 a revised protocol for myocardial preservation has been used in 19 patients undergoing emergency bypass grafting for failed angioplasty. Cardioplegia is induced with a normothermic blood cardioplegic solution. Multiple maintenance doses of cold (4 degrees C) blood cardioplegic solution are then delivered through the aortic root and vein grafts. Before the aortic crossclamp is removed, normothermic reperfusion cardioplegic solution is delivered through the aortic root and vein grafts. This group was compared with all patients undergoing emergency bypass grafting for failed angioplasty before February 1987. These 45 patients received cold induction of cardioplegic solution, multiple maintenance doses of cold cardioplegic solution, and no reperfusion cardioplegic solution. The prevalence of myocardial infarction in the group receiving cold cardioplegic solution was 65% versus 26% in the group receiving normothermic cardioplegic solution (p less than 0.007). Multivariate analysis identified the use of the normothermic cardioplegia protocol (p less than 0.005), nontotal occlusion of the angioplasty vessel (p less than 0.03), and presence of collateral flow to the angioplasty vessel (p less than 0.04) as being independently associated with absence of myocardial infarction.",,R K Bottner;R B Wallace;M S Visner;K S Stark;E Recientes;N M Katz;R A Hopkins;G A Patrissi;K M Kent

Psychosocial factors (overwork, stress, worry) were the most frequently cited causes of MI, with smoking and being overweight or overeating the most frequently cited physical causes. Knowledge of CHD risk factors concentrated on smoking, being overweight and dietary factors, although psychosocial factors were relatively frequently cited. High levels of satisfaction with staff-patient communication were expressed, but knowledge of advice given was generally vague or imprecise and concentrated on dietary modification. Smoking was well-recognized by smokers as a risk factor but less commonly related to their own MI.

Pharmacological revascularization consists of fibrinolytic therapy with antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy. In regard to the anticoagulant therapy, low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are of special importance. LMWHs cause less complications (bleeding, thrombocytopenia, better bioviability) in comparison with unfractionated heparin (UFH). Some studies on use of LMWHs in ACS, show that LMWHs are equally efficient and safe as UFH, causing less complications (different types of hemorrhagic complications) (ESSENCE, TIMI 11B (enoxaparin), FRAXIS-fraxiparin), whereas some studies show better efficacy and safety of enoxaparin in therapy of acute ST-elevated myocardial infarction (ASSENT 3, ASSENT 3 PLUS, HART II, AMI-SK).",,Milovan Petrović;Gordana Panić;Tibor Canji;Ilija Srdanović;Vladimir Ivanović;Dragan Benc

In all patients, initial coronary angiography revealed significant stenosis in only the left anterior descending artery (LAD). All patients were treated medically without reperfusion therapy (such as thrombolytic therapy, angioplasty, or bypass grafting). The regional wall motion in the LAD territory was measured by the centerline method using the right anterior oblique projection. Long-term improvement in anterior wall motion is unlikely in patients with patent LAD or underdeveloped collaterals to the LAD (38%). However, subsequent anterior wall motion frequently improved among patients with severely stenotic or occluded LAD (63%) and well-developed collaterals (73%). Therefore, the anterior wall motion of some LAD-related infarctions improves spontaneously, the extent of coronary collaterals is an important determinant of long-term improvement, and the improvement in wall motion is completed within the early period of acute anterior infarction in patients with patent LAD.",,N Kinoshita;S Nishiyama;T Iwase;S Ishiwata;N Komiyama;Y Yanagishita;S Nakanishi;A Seki

Change of sigmaST between two registrations was expressed as mV/hr, and was compared with clinical and hemodynamic parameters, course of MB-CK curve, calculated infarct mass and arrhythmias. After an initial rapid increase, there was a decrease of sigmaST, which reaches a plateau-like curve approximately 12 hours after the onset of chest pain. A second new increase of sigmaST exceeding a value of 0.6 mV/hr correlates well with extension of necrosis, verified by re-elevation of MB-CK. During the first 2 days, extension of necrosis could be detected in 50% of our patients.

While the diagnosis remains elusive, it must be considered in all patients with recurrent chest pain following acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Pericarditis classically presents with positional chest pain, a pericardial friction rub, diffuse ST-segment elevation, and PR depression, but regional ECG changes associated with infarction-associated pericarditis sometimes exist.

The survivors with anterior myocardial infarction, severe left ventricular dysfunction and ventricular premature depolarizations, making up 15% of the population, have the greatest potential for mortality reduction by appropriate intervention after infarction. The dominance of mechanical and electrical factors in the high risk group necessitates a combined therapeutic approach.

II: Clinical data,"99mTc-Imidodiphosphonate was investigated as a new myocardial infarct imaging agent. In the acute phase, 50 patients admitted to the coronary care unit were serially scanned over a period of 7 days. A mobile gamma camera linked on line to a remote data processor was used. Because of higher uptake in infarcted myocardium and faster blood clearance, superior images than those recorded with 99mTc-pyrophosphate were obtained. Its ease of preparation, low cost, and favourable dosimetry (because of its label with conventional 99mTc) transforms this agent into the present radiopharmaceutical of choice for acute infarct imaging in particular if sizing and follow-up is intended versus time and type of treatment. In this series, no false positive cases were seen. The sensitivity of the method in the detection of full thickness myocardial infarction was 95%. It dropped to 70% in the detection of subendocardial infarction. However, some of these apparent false negative cases may reflect severe ischaemia without infarction. It is postulated that this discrimination may not always be realistic.",,S P Joseph;P J Ell;P Ross;R Donaldson;A T Elliott;N J Brown;E S Williams

We describe the case of a 75-year-old man with chest pain and his electrocardiogram (ECG) revealing ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVf. Inferior wall myocardial infarction was subsequently diagnosed. Before performing emergency coronary angiography, however, a sudden cardiac arrest with PEA developed and the patient was placed on advanced cardiac life support. Oxygenation support for the extracorporeal membrane was initiated approximately 65min after prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Emergency coronary arteriogram showed no obstructive lesions in the right coronary artery. This result, however, was not consistent with the ECG findings, and thus, a massive pulmonary embolism was suspected. Subsequent pulmonary artery angiography showed severe emboli in bilateral branches of the pulmonary arteries. Catheter-directed thrombolysis with urokinase was administered, which ultimately failed, and surgical embolectomy was performed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. After the above intervention, the patient was discharged on hospital day 60 without any sequelae or neurological deficits.",Cardiac arrest; Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support; Pulmonary embolism.,Yung-Kun Hsieh;Fu-Yuan Siao;Chun-Chieh Chiu;Hsu-Heng Yen;Yao-Li Chen

Fifteen dogs were studied before and serially for up to 6 hr after anterior descending or circumflex coronary artery ligation in vivo by gated MRI with a 0.15 tesla resistive magnet (resonant frequency of hydrogen 6.25 MHz). Image acquisition was by single-spin echo, with echo times (TE) of 30 msec and TE 60 msec, and modified inversion recovery pulse sequences. Excellent anatomic definition was observed. By 4 hr after coronary artery occlusion the signal in the infarct zone increased to 36 +/- 20% greater than that in the adjacent normal myocardium for the TE 30 msec sequence (p less than .01) and to 116 +/- 100% for the TE 60 msec sequence (p less than .05). The most intense increase in signal was noted with the TE 60 msec pulse sequence and because normal myocardium is not well visualized by this technique, acutely ischemic myocardium was clearly delineated. Inversion recovery imaging did not show areas of ischemia. Changes seen on MR images correlated well with the location of ischemic changes noted on microscopic examination of the excised hearts.

The method is unique in allowing us to continuously examine the patient over an extended period of time in a changing environmental milieu. In survivors of acute myocardial infarction the prevalence of ambulatory or transient myocardial ischemia is lower than in patients with chronic, stable coronary artery disease. A greater proportion of ischemic episodes, however, are silent than in other subgroups with ischemic heart disease. Early after the infarction, transient myocardial ischemia exhibits a circadian variation with a peak activity occurring in the late evening hours. Patients with non-Q wave infarction have more transient myocardial ischemia, whereas thrombolytic therapy seems to result in less residual ischemia. Exercise testing is more sensitive than ambulatory monitoring in the detection of postinfarction myocardial ischemia. There appears to be a poor association between transient myocardial ischemia and severe left ventricular dysfunction. Transient myocardial ischemia has been shown to provide prognostic information in different subsets of patients with previous myocardial infarction, but there is considerable disagreement about how this is expressed in terms of cardiac events.

In contrast to spontaneous myocardial infarction (MI), the prognostic relevance of pMI is the subject of ongoing debate. Data from retrospective analyses of large, randomized clinical trials, and large, contemporary cohort studies have several shortcomings that limit their extrapolation to clinical practice. In our opinion, the currently available evidence is insufficient to conclude that pMI during PCI, as currently defined, always has important prognostic implications. Until further evidence is available, we recommend adopting the definition for MI given in the third universal definition of MI, which differentiates between pMI and spontaneous MI.

Between August 2000 and May 2001, a total of 100 patients with acute IWMI were enrolled. History of all patients was taken, and thorough clinical examination was performed to asses the presence of signs of right ventricular infarction. Standard 12-lead electrocardiogram was recorded immediately on arrival of patients along with right precordial leads.

Acute depression and subsequent recovery of left ventricular function: serial measurements in intact conscious dogs,"Acute myocardial infarction causes depression of left ventricular function, but the capacity of the ventricle to recover from such an injury remains unknown. This problem was explored by measuring left ventricular function in eight intact conscious dogs before, 1 hr after, and again 6-8 days after myocardial infarction. Acute myocardial infarction was produced using a technique which entails gradual inflation over an average period of 1 hr of a balloon cuff previously implanted around the left anterior descending coronary artery. Occurrence of anterior wall infarction was detected electrocardiographically and later confirmed by postmortem examination. Left ventricular function was evaluated from the relationship between left ventricular developed pressure (left ventricular peak systolic pressure minus left ventricular end-diastolic pressure) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure during transient aortic occlusion with a balloon catheter. Left ventricular function curves were obtained by plotting left ventricular-developed pressure at increasing left ventricular end-diastolic pressures up to 50 mm Hg. Acute myocardial infarction caused marked depression of left ventricular function measured 1 hr after onset of infarction, but 1 wk later all eight animals showed improvement with return of function toward the control levels. A small but significant descending limb was noted at left ventricular end-diastolic pressures above 35 mm Hg. Quantitatively, the descending limb was similar before, 1 hr after, and 1 wk after myocardial infarction. Hemodynamic data revealed evidence of left ventricular failure in all animals, but variability in individual hemodynamic parameters was noted. The data indicate that the marked depression of left ventricular function observed immediately after experimental acute myocardial infarction undergoes considerable resolution within 1 wk, but that functional recovery remains incomplete.",,R Kumar;W B Hood Jr;J Joison;J C Norman;W H Abelmann

Diagnosis of right ventricle myocardial infarction was made on the basis of clinical, electrocardiographic, hemodynamic criteria, respectively present in 66%, 80% and 66% of our patients. Echocardiographic criteria of right ventricle infarction were: 1) right ventricle dilatation; 2) segmental or global right ventricle wall motion abnormalities; 3) paradoxical motion of interventricular septum; 4) tricuspid insufficiency; 5) inferior cava vein dilatation with paradoxical respiratory pattern. Seven patients were studied by means of radionuclide techniques, that confirmed right ventricle infarction in 6 patients. We conclude that: 1) the most accurate echocardiographic views for right ventricle wall motion study are subcostal views and, in particular, the subcostal short-axis (OAS 60 degrees); 2) those patients (12/18) with a specific echocardiographic pattern for right ventricle infarction presented a specific clinical and hemodynamic picture; 3) those patients (6/18) with only segmental right ventricular wall motion abnormalities presented an aspecific clinical and hemodynamic picture.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10697436/,Phagocytic activity of platelets in patients with myocardial infarction,"The aim of our present study was to analyse the dynamics of changes in the phagocytic activity of platelets with myocardial infarction according to the treatment applied. Twenty patients with acute myocardial infarction and thirty healthy subjects were examined. Platelet count, phagocytic activity of platelets and the phagocytic index were determined. We observed reduced phagocytic activity of platelets in the first 24 hours of infarction, which may be due to exhaustion of most active platelets in a thrombus and microaggregates. A transitory increase in the phagocytosis activity of platelets observed on the third day of infarction may be caused by the release of large, more active platelets from splenic pool. On the eight day of infarction, the phagocytic activity of platelets became normalized in both experimental groups. Our study indicates that together with platelet activation the phagocytic activity gets reduced being a likely response to the thrombocytopenic factor. This can be confirmed by the increased number of platelets on the 8th day. Our results suggest a slightly attenuated phagocytic ability of platelets, irrespective of the treatment applied.

Intraaortic balloon counterpulsation provides temporary hemodynamic and clinical improvement in the majority of patients with cardiogenic shock.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21821523/,No-reflow phenomenon: maintaining vascular integrity,"The no-reflow phenomenon relates to the inability to reperfuse regions of the myocardium after ischemia, despite removal of the large epicardial coronary artery occlusion. The mechanism involves microvascular obstruction. In experimental studies, using markers for flow (thioflavin S, carbon black, microspheres), perfusion defects associated with no-reflow demonstrated ultrastructural evidence of localized endothelial swelling and blebs that appeared to obstruct flow. In humans no-reflow is more complicated due to the microemboli of atherosclerotic debris and thrombi generated by percutaneous coronary intervention. The no-reflow zone expands during the first few hours of reperfusion suggesting an element of reperfusion injury. In animal models, extensive no-reflow was associated with worse infarct expansion. The phenomenon of no-reflow following reperfusion therapy for myocardial infarction in humans has been demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging, echo contrast agents, thallium, technecium-99m-labeled albumin microspheres, Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) scores, and myocardial blush grade. Patients exhibiting no-reflow following reperfusion therapy for myocardial infarction have greater left ventricular dilation and remodeling, more congestive heart failure, shock, and reduced survival. Certain vasodilators (adenosine, nitroprusside, nicorandil, and calcium blockers) are used acutely in the catheterization laboratory and appear to improve no-reflow, but systematic studies on therapy for no-reflow are needed. There is now clinical evidence that no-reflow is a strong predictor of long-term mortality that is independent of and beyond that provided by infarct size. Identifying and treating no-reflow may have important benefits including enhancing delivery of nutrients and cells required for healing and reducing infarct expansion and ventricular remodeling, which ultimately may reduce congestive heart failure and mortality.",,Robert A Kloner

All were evaluated by 2-dimensional echocardiography (2-D echo) and radionuclide angiography. Patients with advanced AV block had lower radionuclide left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (51 +/- 10 vs 58 +/- 11%, p less than 0.01), higher LV wall motion score on 2-D echo (5.6 +/- 2.6 vs 3.1 +/- 2.7, p less than 0.001), lower radionuclide right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction (32 +/- 15 vs 39 +/- 16%, p less than 0.001) and higher RV wall motion score on 2-D echo (3.4 +/- 1.7 vs 1.5 +/- 2, p less than 0.002) than did patients without AV block. The incidence rate of RV dysfunction was higher in patients with advanced AV block (78 vs 40%, p less than 0.02), and the mortality rate was also higher (although not significantly) in patients with advanced AV block (15 vs 6%). In conclusion, patients with inferior acute myocardial infarction and advanced AV block have larger infarct sizes (as seen on radionuclide angiography and 2-D echo) and lower RV and LV function than patients without AV block. This finding may explain the higher mortality rate observed in this group.",,B Strasberg;A Pinchas;A Arditti;R F Lewin;S Sclarovsky;C Hellman;N Zafrir;J Agmon

The experimental myocardial infarction was induced in five animals during an operation by the ligation RIVA. The myocardial blood supply was measured in tissue samples, taken from transverse sections of the infarction by means of 86Rb captation. The extent of myocytolysis was measured by depletion of tissue creatine kinase (CK). In the subendocardial layer of the infarction it became obvious that 99mTc-PYP incorporation was proportional to the decrease of tissue blood supply. No relation between the extent of necrosis and the incorporation of the radioactive chemical was demonstrated. The accumulation of 99mTc-PYP requires the necrosis to be present, but its extent apparently does not influence the intensity of incorporation.

However, it is an unusual diagnosis in the pediatric population, especially in the neonatal period. The authors present 2 autopsy cases of MI in newborn babies of twin pregnancies with normal heart and coronary arteries. The first case is that of a 10-day-old female, monochorionic-diamniotic, twin B born at 29 weeks' gestation. The autopsy revealed diffuse subacute MI in both ventricles, which was compatible with a global hypoxic event during perinatal period. The hypoxic insult was likely caused by maternal HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) syndrome as evident in the placental examination, which showed placental infarct and decidual arteriopathy. The second case is that of a 2-day-old term male, dichorionic-diamniotic, twin A with an antenatal history of prolonged rupture of membranes. The hospital course was complicated by neonatal sepsis. The autopsy showed diffuse hemorrhage in the internal organs including the heart, along with myocyte necrosis.

Some theories of pathogenesis and aetiology of ischaemic heart disease, specially those which are more important and relevant to the medicolegal practice, are discussed. Results of the study of 33 cases of coronary artery atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction at different stages of development are presented. The condition of the coronary arteries and the myocardium is examined on gross and microscopical levels. Pathological findings are correlated with the clinical data obtained from the case histories and the summaries of the necropsy requests. No good correlation exists between the observed pathological changes and the clinical age of the infarction and, in most instances, the latter appears younger than the age estimated on the pathological ground alone. As far as the age of the infarction is concerned, most special histochemical staining methods are not preferable to the routine haematoxylin and eosin method. However, the former are efficient in demonstrating and confirming certain aspects of the infarction which cannot be ascertained by the latter method of staining. Pathological alterations associated with myocardial infarction at successive ages are explained and various methods of estimating the time of the infarction are discussed. Thus, gross and microscopical appearances of the acute, organizing and healed myocardial infarction are illustrated by photographs and the forensic applications of these morphological changes are discussed. Lastly, a rare case of an acute myocardial infarction associated with a heat stroke is presented and the medicolegal problems resulting from this case are discussed.",,L M al-Alousi

It is further recognized that an MI is just one of many types of acute myocardial injury. The Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction provides a taxonomy for acute myocardial injury, including 5 subtypes of MI and nonischemic myocardial injury. The diagnosis of MI is reserved for patients with myocardial ischemia as the cause of myocardial injury, whether attributable to acute atherothrombosis (type 1 MI) or supply/demand mismatch without acute atherothrombosis (type 2 MI). Myocardial injury in the absence of ischemia is categorized as acute or chronic nonischemic myocardial injury. However, optimal evaluation and treatment strategies for these etiologically distinct diagnoses have yet to be defined.

The reduction in mortality (38%) was significant at the 1% level. The figures for non-fatal reinfarction (97 in the placebo group, and 75 in the practolol group) were not significantly different. Patients with pre-entry anterior infarction, and especially those with a diastolic blood pressure equal to or below the mean (78 mm Hg) at entry to the trial, were at high risk but benefited particularly well from beta-adrenoceptor blockade. After pre-entry inferior infarction the percentage reduction in deaths occurring within two hours after symptoms of a new event was similar to that after anterior infarction, but the incidence of death more than two hours after the event was greater in the practolol-treated group. Thus the difference between groups in total deaths after pretrial inferior infarction was marginal.

In patients with sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD), it is assumed that apnea-associated changes of hemodynamics, blood gases, and rheology lead to a higher frequency of myocardial infarction during sleep. This investigation analyzes the circadian pattern of myocardial infarction in patients with and without SRBD. Within a time period of 20 months, 89 male patients with acute myocardial infarction were consecutively admitted to the intensive care unit. A nocturnal long-term registration of oxygen saturation, heart rate, breathing sounds, and body position by means of a 4-channel recording system (MESAM IV) was carried out in 59 of the 89 patients 6 to 10 days (evaluation I) and in 43 of 59 patients 22 to 28 days after infarction (evaluation II). Sleep apnea with a respiratory-disturbance-index (RDI > or = 10/h was found in 44.1/39.5% of the patients (evaluation I/II). In 22% of the patients, time of infarction was during a sleeping period.

Cardiac rehabilitation has developed into an active strategy of secondary prevention, based on sufficient diagnostic evaluation, aiming at the modification of risks factors and including the entire psychosocial field into the long-term therapeutic concept. After myocardial infarction the patient carries, in comparison to the normal population, approximately a tenfold risk to die suddenly or to suffer another myocardial infarction. Following a first infarction, risk factors such as smoking, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are of increased epidemiologic importance. A lower social class will in itself lead to an increase of the incidence of reinfarction and to a decrease in life expectancy. One of the central goals therefore is to convey the importance of a health-oriented behavior pattern, which is achieved in single and group-therapy sessions as well as with the help of physiotherapy. Controlled physical exercise, however, does not only serve as an educational vehicle, but also has direct effects on cardiovascular physiology, leading to a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure for a given work load and thus to an increase of the angina pectoris threshold. Moreover, controlled physical exercise has a substantial antidepressive effect in the critical phase following acute myocardial infarction, and will lead to increased self-confidence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,P Mathes

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15313745/,Primary angioplasty and thrombolysis are both reasonable options in acute myocardial infarction,"Primary angioplasty is increasingly being advocated as the preferred approach for treating acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction regardless of whether interinstitutional transfer is required. This review critically analyzes the evidence comparing primary angioplasty with thrombolytic therapy and concludes that reasonable health care professionals may still find considerable uncertainty about the superiority of primary angioplasty for all situations. The magnitude of benefit for primary angioplasty over thrombolysis is probably less than 1 to 2 lives saved/100 patients treated and largely depends on the choice of thrombolytic agent, time to treatment, place of treatment, and adjunctive therapy. There is little evidence that systematically transferring patients for primary angioplasty in routine practice will provide any health benefits over thrombolysis. Consequently, it may be most useful to view these treatments as complementary rather than competitive. Thrombolysis remains a clinically and economically attractive option for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction that does not require the radical restructuring of our health care systems.",,James M Brophy;Peter Bogaty

Of the agents currently available for clinical use, nifedipine has been studied most extensively. This agent shows no beneficial effects in this setting and its use may in fact be harmful. Of the few trials that have been conducted with verapamil, none have shown decreased mortality. Verapamil may reduce infarct size although further confirmation is required. Diltiazem is the only agent that has been shown to have short- and long-term benefits in the patient with acute myocardial infarction.

MR has prognostic importance in patients after myocardial infarction and those undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, but the long-term outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are less well defined. We evaluated patients who underwent PCI and had assessment of MR by left ventriculography and/or echocardiography in the year 2000. We determined effects of MR on 30-day and 5-year survival. The cohort included 711 patients (67% men) with an average age of 64.5 +/- 12.4 years. MR severity was divided into 3 strata: none (n = 420, 59%), mild (n = 209, 29%), and moderate to severe (n = 82, 12%). Patients with more severe MR differed from patients with mild or no MR in that they were older (p <0.001), more frequently women (p <0.001), and more likely to have a coronary artery bypass graft (p <0.001), myocardial infarction (p <0.001), and lower ejection fraction (p <0.001). Decreased survival rates were associated with increasing MR severity (none vs mild vs moderate to severe) at 30 days (100%, 98.7%, and 96.6%, respectively; p <0.0025) and 5 years (97%, 83.3%, and 57.5%; p <0.0001).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2009889/,Effects of coronary angioplasty on left ventricular diastolic filling in patients with old myocardial infarction: a study with pulsed Doppler echocardiography,"To examine the effects of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) on left ventricular diastolic filling in patients with an old myocardial infarction, transmitral flow velocity pattern was measured using pulsed Doppler echocardiography before and after PTCA for the peak early diastolic filling velocity (E) and the ratio of the early diastolic filling to peak atrial filling velocities (E/A ratio) in 73 patients with coronary artery disease. These patients were classified into three groups: 34 patients without previous myocardial infarction (no MI group), 16 patients with an old myocardial infarction in whom a non-infarct-related vessel was reperfused by PTCA (MI-1 group), and 23 patients with an old myocardial infarction in whom the infarct-related vessel was reperfused by PCTA (MI-2 group). The degree of improvement in left ventricular diastolic filling was calculated using the values before PTCA as controls. The % increases in E and E/A ratio were 20 +/- 15 and 25 +/- 19%, respectively, in the no MI group and 27 +/- 20 and 18 +/- 16%, respectively, in the MI-1 group and there was no significant difference between these groups. The % increases in E and E/A ratio in the MI-2 group were 7 +/- 19 and 6 +/- 17%, respectively, and were significantly (P less than 0.05) less than those in the no MI and MI-1 groups.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6696386/,Prognosis after myocardial infarction,"There is 10-20 percent mortality in the first two years after hospital discharge from a myocardial infarction. Patient management would be facilitated if one could stratify patients into those who have a low, medium or high risk of death within the first two years following infarction. Towards achieving this end a multicenter study was designed. 866 patients were enrolled over a two-year period from four widely separated geographic centers in the United States. Criteria for enrollment included definite acute myocardial infarction and age less than 70 years. 452 clinical variables were obtained from each patient and entered into a central computer file. Special studies obtained just prior to discharge included a 24-hour computer analyzed Holter recording and a radionuclide ejection fraction. 70 percent of the patients had a low-level predischarge treadmill activity test. Before the study a hypothesis was generated and tested prospectively. This was as follows: there are three clinical risk variables that have independent influence on survival. They are: ejection fraction less than 40 percent, ventricular ectopic depolarization frequency greater than 10 per hour, and the presence of angina pectoris before hospital discharge. The 22-month mortality was 11.6 percent (101 deaths). The variables which had the most significant association with cardiac mortality were those which reflected mechanical cardiac dysfunction either before or during acute hospitalization. The arrhythmia variable (VEDs) were less strongly associated with mortality than the mechanical parameters and the ischemia variable (angina pectoris prior to discharge) did not significantly discriminate between those who survived and died.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,F I Marcus

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7634291/,[Coronary recanalization in acute myocardial infarction: early coronary angiography],"In acute myocardial infarction the early patency of the infarct-related artery is positively correlated with improved left ventricular function and survival. Coronary artery reperfusion is commonly achieved by intravenous administration of thrombolytic agents. Methods of mechanical recanalization, mainly percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), have been proposed and tested as alternative or adjunctive ways to thrombolysis. Early coronary angiography provides reliable and irreplaceable information concerning mechanical intervention utility and feasibility. Therefore, it is incorporated in the mechanical revascularization strategies at various stages in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. In the primary, direct PTCA strategy early coronary arteriography is done for planning and carrying out mechanical revascularization as an alternative to intravenous thrombolytic therapy. This strategy may be particularly effective in patients presenting with cardiogenic shock, large infarctions, contraindications to thrombolytic therapy, and prior bypass surgery. Coronary angiography in evolving myocardial infarction has also been proposed to set the stage for rescue PTCA when thrombolysis has proved to be ineffective. Nevertheless, there are currently no unequivocal data to judge the value of the rescue PTCA strategy. After unsuccessful thrombolysis, this approach should be considered in patients with a large infarction, with cardiogenic shock, with left ventricular dysfunction and with refractory ischemia. Early, routine coronary angiography after lytic recanalization is not recommended. In fact, the strategy of immediate arteriography plus PTCA after thrombolytic therapy does not improve outcome but leads to several deleterious effects.",,G Russo;C Tamburino;R Aiello;A Drago;V Calvi;G Giuffrida

Monitoring facilities were established in the NMR imaging suite that provided the same level of reliability and safety found in a standard coronary care unit. An imaging protocol was developed that allowed the acquisition of a complete study in 30 minutes while providing useful information about mechanical function and myocardial tissue contrast. Eighteen postthrombolysis patients were imaged within 21 +/- 2 hours of chest pain onset. No patient developed recurrent chest pain or arrhythmias in the NMR imaging suite. Relatively T2-weighted spin-echo images (echo time = 60 ms; repetition time = heart rate) provided interpretable images in 16 patients. Fourteen normal subjects were imaged for comparison. Thirteen of 16 patients had an increase in signal intensity in the region of the infarction. Regional wall thickening was assessed using a floating endocardial centroid technique. Wall motion abnormalities detected by NMR corresponded to those noted by 2-dimensional echocardiography and contrast angiography. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the detection of infarction were 93, 80 and 87%, respectively, when signal intensity and wall thickening abnormalities were combined.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27762311/,Temporal shifts in clinical presentation and underlying mechanisms of atherosclerotic disease,"The concept of the 'vulnerable plaque' originated from pathological observations in patients who died from acute coronary syndrome. This recognition spawned a generation of research that led to greater understanding of how complicated atherosclerotic plaques form and precipitate thrombotic events. In current practice, an increasing number of patients who survive their first event present with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) rather than myocardial infarction (MI) with ST-segment elevation (STEMI). The culprit lesions that provide the pathological substrate for NSTEMI can vary considerably from the so-called 'vulnerable plaque'. The shift in clinical presentation of MI and stroke corresponds temporally to a progressive change in the characteristics of human plaques away from the supposed characteristics of vulnerability. These alterations in the structure and function of human atherosclerotic lesions might mirror the modifications that are produced in experimental plaques by lipid lowering, inspired by the vulnerable plaque construct. The shift in the clinical presentations of the acute coronary syndromes mandates a critical reassessment of the underlying mechanisms, proposed risk scores, the results and interpretation of preclinical experiments, as well as recognition of the limitations of the use of population data and samples collected before the application of current preventive interventions.",,Gerard Pasterkamp;Hester M den Ruijter;Peter Libby

Direct electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform comparison is a new standardized procedure for diagnosing interim myocardial infarction from ECGs classified according to the Minnesota code (serial Q-wave pattern change). This procedure was investigated for its application in epidemiologic studies. Use of this procedure in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial resulted in a 50% increase in the positive predictive accuracy, improved agreement with clinically defined myocardial infarction and a strong independent prognostic association with total and coronary heart disease mortality. Among those with major Minnesota Q-code findings, there was substantial variation in mortality. The 5-year coronary heart disease death rates estimated by life table analysis were 8.5% for those with major serial Q-wave pattern change, 5.1% for those with minor serial Q-wave pattern change and 1.5 to 2.6% for those with major or minor Minnesota Q-code change not substantiated by direct waveform comparison, compared with 2.4% for those with no Minnesota Q-code findings. The coronary heart disease death rate for those with major serial Q-wave pattern change was greater than that for the other ECG groups (p less than 0.01).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1960688/,Pre-hospital thrombolysis: current status and future prospects,"The impact of thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction has been such that it now constitutes standard therapy for patients who present to hospital with acute myocardial infarction. In an attempt to minimise the duration of ischaemia, and subsequent impairment of contractile function, trials of pre-hospital thrombolysis have been initiated. These reveal time gains of up to 60 minutes but convincing evidence of clinical benefit has not yet been forthcoming. This review examines the rationale for very early thrombolysis, in the context of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. It examines the impact of recent small scale studies on coronary patency, left ventricular function and infarct size and examines the potential risks. Large scale studies of pre-hospital thrombolysis are in progress and their findings will need to be interpreted in comparison with optimal 'fast-track' in-hospital treatment. The review highlights the need for co-ordinated policies for acute management of myocardial infarction involving primary care, the emergency medical systems and cardiac units. Enthusiasm for wide scale administration of thrombolytics by general practitioners, without electrocardiographic confirmation of the diagnosis, must be tempered by a clear analysis of the potential risks and benefits. Current evidence does not support such widespread clinical application, outwith the current evaluation studies.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26988997/,Animal models of myocardial infarction: Mainstay in clinical translation,"Preclinical models with high prognostic power are a prerequisite for translational research. The closer the similarity of a model to myocardial infarction (MI), the higher is the prognostic value for clinical trials. An ideal MI model should present cardinal signs and pathology that resemble the human disease. The increasing understanding of MI stratification and etiology, however, complicates the choice of animal model for preclinical studies. An ultimate animal model, relevant to address all MI related pathophysiology is yet to be developed.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/232148/,"Scintigraphic, electrocardiographic, and enzymatic diagnosis of perioperative myocardial infarction in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization","To assess the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction, 214 consecutive patients were evaluated 1-5 days after coronary bypass surgery, using Tc-99m pyrophosphate (TcPPi) myocardial imaging, serial electrocardiograms (ECG), and enzyme levels (SGOT, LDH, CPK). On the basis of the clinical course and scintigraphic, enzymatic, and ECG changes, the diagnosis of perioperative infarction was definite in 17 of 241 cases (7.9%) and probable in six of 241 (2.8%). In all of these 23 patients, TcPPi scans were abnormal; one additional patient had a false-positive scintigram. Only 13 of the 23 had ECG evidence of infarction, but there were no false positives. We set the threshold for abnormality of enzyme changes quite high, owing to experience in more than 900 postoperative patients (SGOT greater than 200, LDH greater than 500, CPK greater than 500 on the same day). Using these criteria, 22 of the 23 infarct patients had abnormal enzymes, and six others were falsely positive. These results indicate a relatively low sensitivity for the ECG in diagnosing perioperative infarction, but the lack of false positives suggests high specificity. The sensitivity and specificity of the enzymes and the TcPPi image were both excellent and quite similar; the main difference was a reduction of certainty of infarction with the enzyme criteria, caused by the six patients whose enzyme values were falsely positive. Considering its sensitivity, specificity, and ability to locate and to a certain extent quantitate necrosis. TcPPi imaging is probably the most valuable means of diagnosing perioperative myocardial infarction.",,J A Burdine;E G DePuey;F Orzan;V S Mathur;R J Hall

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6696384/,[Infarction of the right ventricle],"Anatomical studies have confirmed that isolated right ventricular and anterior biventricular infarcts are rare. However, RV extension is found in 36 to 50 per cent of cases of postero-inferior infarcts, which confirms the findings of invasive and non-invasive investigations which detect acute RV dysfunction with the same frequency after this type of infarct. It is difficult to create right ventricular infarction experimentally because of the relative protection against ischaemia of the RV. In man, this condition almost always implies an associated thrombosis of the proximal right coronary artery and significant stenosis of the IVA, which justifies the broad indications for coronary angiography. The two major haemodynamic consequences of right ventricular infarction are due to original pathophysiological mechanisms: the adiastole seems to be due to a limitation of RV dilatation by the pericardium, the reduced output is due to faulty LV filling as a result of RV systolic dysfunction and associated factors such as the absence of efficient and synchronous atrial systole secondary to AVB (60%) or to acute right atrial paralysis. The choice of treatment is based on these pathophysiological data. The diagnosis of infarction of the RV is straightforward, often suggested on clinical examination (RVI syndrome: reduced output in 45% of cases) and the surface E.C.G. (ST-T depression 1 mm in V3R-V4R-V5R). The diagnosis is confirmed by more sophisticated investigations which can evaluate the degree of systolic dysfunction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,J C Daubert;B Langella;C Descaves;T Leleyour;C Bourdonnec

Results from the population-based ""acute myocardial infarction in Florence 2"" (AMI-Florence 2) registry","ST-segment and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, NSTEMI) have opposite epidemiology, the latter being nowadays more common than the former. Consistently with these epidemiological trends, application of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of NSTEMI should be promoted. We compared clinical features, hospital management and prognosis of STEMI/NSTEMI in an unselected cohort of 1,496 prospectively enrolled patients (STEMI, 36.9 % and NSTEMI, 63.1 %), admitted in 1 year to one of the six hospitals in Florence health district (Italy). Vital status was assessed after 1 year. NSTEMI patients were older, more often female, and affected by cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular comorbidities. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed more often in STEMI (82 %) than in NSTEMI patients (48 %, p < 0.001). Aspirin, clopidogrel, statins, beta-blockers, and ACE-inhibitors were prescribed more frequently in STEMI. In-hospital mortality was significantly lower in NSTEMI than in STEMI (4.2 vs. 8.9 %, p < 0.001), even after adjusting for confounders in a multivariable logistic model (OR 0.27, 95 % CI 0.16-0.45). One-year mortality was similar in NSTEMI and STEMI patients in an unadjusted comparison (18.0 vs. 16.7 %, p = 0.51), but it was lower in NSTEMI patients in multivariable Cox analysis (HR 0.56, 95 % CI 0.42-0.75). PCI reduced the risk of 1-year mortality similarly in STEMI (HR 0.47, 95 % CI 0.28-0.79) and NSTEMI (HR 0.41, 95 % CI 0.28-0.60).

Nevertheless, a distinction is important, because the two entities have a different prognosis. At the present time, between 25% and 35% of MIs are non-Q wave. They are frequently observed in patients with previous coronary events. They occur in a relatively older population and involve a slightly higher proportion of women than do Q wave MIs. The degree of cardiac damage is less, reflected by a smaller rise in enzyme level and less impairment of left ventricular ejection fraction; early reperfusion may occur, after spontaneous thrombolysis or resolution of coronary spasm. The immediate mortality rate is half that of Q wave MI but identical in the long term. Reinfarction and angina are more frequent because of a peri-infarction zone of ischemia maintained by a high-grade coronary stenosis and inadequate collateral circulation. Early characterization of those MIs likely to progress is important. Diltiazem seems effective in this context if given between 24 and 72 hours of the onset of the event.

A full clinical assessment allows the detection of patients with major infarction, present in the majority of those suffering arrhythmic events during follow-up. More sophisticated noninvasive tests, including Holter monitoring, and the high gain, signal averaged ECG, add prognostic accuracy to clinical assessment in patients with major infarction but are by themselves nonspecific. Noninvasive assessment of autonomic function from baroreceptor sensitivity analysis and heart rate variability measurement may also provide useful prognostic information. The results of programmed ventricular stimulation studies in patients with recent acute infarction have been contradictory, though many of the disagreements can be explained by methodological differences. At best this technique is highly invasive, and probably adds little to what can be discovered from a thorough noninvasive assessment. The treatment to be adopted in those judged to be at high risk remains to be established, and this may include nonpharmacological modalities such as the implantable defibrillator and surgical ablation as alternatives to drug therapy.",,T R Cripps;A J Camm
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29138828/,Identification of risk genes associated with myocardial infarction based on the recursive feature elimination algorithm and support vector machine classifier,"The aim of the present study was to identify risk genes in myocardial infarction. Microarray data GSE34198, containing data from the peripheral blood of 49 myocardial infarction samples and 48 corresponding control samples, were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to screen the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The DEGs were used to construct a protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network of patient samples, from which the feature genes were identified using the neighboring score method. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm was employed to select the risk genes among feature genes, which were subsequently applied to perform a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to identify the specific signature in myocardial infarction samples. Another dataset, GSE61144, was also downloaded to verify the efficacy of the classifier. A total of 724 downregulated and 483 upregulated DEGs were screened in patient samples compared with control samples in the GSE34198 dataset. The PPI network of myocardial infarction was comprised of 1,083 nodes (genes) and 46,363 lines (connections). Using the neighborhood scoring method, the top 100 feature genes in myocardial infarction samples were identified as the disease feature genes, which distinguish the myocardial infarction samples from the control samples. The RFE algorithm screened 15 risk genes, which were employed to construct a SVM classifier with an average precision of 88% to the patient sample following visualization by a confusion matrix. The predictive precision of the classifier on another microarray dataset, GSE61144, was 0.92, with an average true positive of 0.9278 and an average false positive of 0.2361. A‑kinase‑anchoring protein 12 (AKAP12) and glycine receptor α2 (GLRA2) were two risk genes in the SVM classifier. Therefore, AKAP12 and GLRA2 exert potential roles in the development of myocardial infarction, potentially by influencing cardiac contractility and protecting against ischemia‑reperfusion injury, which may provide clues in developing potential diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets for myocardial infarction.",,Xiaoqiang Yang

Serial hemodynamic parameters were determined over the next 4 days and compared in patients receiving medical treatment alone with those treated with additional intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation. There were no significant differences among severity of disease (i.e., Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score) initially and no differences among both groups for disease improvement.

However, there were no significant differences between the IABP group and the medical-alone group.

At the hospital stage of rehabilitation it has been established that the contractile activity of the myocardium is the same in both groups of patients and is characterized by hypodynamia. On this basis it was concluded that further physical rehabilitation of these patients should be conducted at a moderate pace with an obligatory control of exercise tolerance. The dynamic observation 1--2 years after myocardial infarction has demonstrated that the physical capacity for work is higher among the patients rehabilitated according to the 3 1/2-week programme, than among the control group patients.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6948503/,Natural history of myocardial infarction--relevance for secondary prevention,"Numerous variables have been identified as having prognostic value after infarction. The significance of each of these depends both on the time after the event when the observation is made and the length of follow-up. Although much prognostic information has been published, its validity is difficult to establish because the criteria for infarction have seldom been stated, the effect of treatment has been ignored and the case material has been either ill-defined or atypical. Most of the most powerful predictors of medium and long-term prognosis are not susceptible to correction, e.g. age, previous myocardial infarction, cardiomegaly, enzyme levels, intraventricular conduction defects and indices of left ventricular dysfunction. Others, e.g. ""warning arrhythmias"" may be treatable but there is, as yet, no evidence that suppressing them improves prognosis. The most clinically relevant prognostic factors are those which are of relatively high predictive value but are potentially correctable. These include smoking, hypertension, diabetes, life-threatening arrhythmias, and exercise-induced ischaemia, as manifested by angina and ST changes. Secondary prevention is most likely to be successful if appropriate approaches are aimed at specific subsets. Thus, beta-blockade, anti-arrhythmic therapy, platelet active agents, and surgery may each be beneficial in different although possibly overlapping sub-sets. Even if it is shown that any one of these forms of therapy produces a statistical benefit when given to the whole post-infarct population, it does not follow that it should be given to all members of such a population.",,D G Julian

In the past 5 years, rapid progress has been made in the management of patients with unstable coronary syndromes, and treatment guidelines should be revised to reflect these advances. An international forum of cardiology investigators convened to discuss areas in which the diagnosis and treatment of unstable angina/non-Q-wave myocardial infarction should be modified. Although there were areas of controversy, it was agreed that there is sufficient evidence to recommend the following changes: 1) the use of serum cardiac markers should be expanded to include troponin I and T levels as diagnostic and prognostic tools, 2) low-molecular-weight heparins should replace UH as antithrombin agents, 3) new classes of antiplatelet agents are recommended in addition to aspirin, 4) the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs is appropriate in the long-term management of these patients. The rationale for these suggested revisions, including evidence from pertinent clinical trials, is discussed in detail in the accompanying document.",,E P Gurfinkel

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1725053/,Antiarrhythmic therapy and survival following myocardial infarction,"Arrhythmias remain a major cause of late mortality following myocardial infarction. They arise due to fibrosis within the infarct, which creates the conditions of slow conduction necessary for re-entry. In individual patients who have already manifested a malignant arrhythmia, antiarrhythmic drug therapy, guided by invasive electrophysiological testing, is of proven benefit in prolonging survival. By contrast, when used on a population basis, antiarrhythmic drug therapy has proved singularly ineffective. This is illustrated by the recent Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) study--far from improving survival, antiarrhythmic therapy increased mortality. The use of antiarrhythmic drugs on a population basis is therefore fundamentally flawed. Hemodynamic intervention provides an alternative strategy in arrhythmia prevention. Hemodynamic changes may influence electrophysiological parameters and arrhythmogenesis in a number of ways. First, myocardial stretch may contribute to arrhythmogenesis through contraction-excitation feedback. Second, hemodynamic changes can influence ventricular remodeling following infarction, which may be an important determinant of subsequent arrhythmogenesis. Hemodynamic intervention, therefore, represents a promising new approach to arrhythmia prevention following myocardial infarction.",,J C Cowan;D S Coulshed;A G Zaman

A cohort of 157 post-MI patients who participated in a cardiac rehabilitation program was tested for compliance with the Health Adherence Scale and Miller Attitude Scale during hospitalization and again six months later. This study reports on follow-up conducted two to five years after initial MI to determine whether patients' attitudes and adherence behaviors had a significant effect on subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and overall mortality after controlling for known risk factors. The data were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. Neither positive patient attitudes nor adherence behaviors were associated with a reduced risk of a morbid or fatal event. However, this study found, as have many others, that the known risk factors of alcoholism, widowhood, cigarette smoking, and diabetes were significantly associated with repeat episodes of MI, while the only risk factor associated with mortality was repeat MI. The study suggests that the benefits of positive attitudes and adherence behaviors are outweighed by the influence of existing cardiovascular risk factors. Thus, the prevention of these risk factors remains the primary determinant in the reduction of MI.",,M R Stegman;P J Miller;R K Hageman;D E Irby;A K Kositzky-Klutman;N J Rajek

There are several hemodynamic disturbances that can occur after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction including pulmonary congestion, cardiogenic shock and mechanical complications such as left-ventricular free-wall rupture, ventricular-septal defect or papillary muscle rupture. Patients with hemodynamic compromise should be admitted to the coronary care unit and therapy should be initiated with drugs such as vasodilators, diuretics and positive-inotropic agents, based on hemodynamic data provided by the invasive catheter. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should be used for those who fail to achieve hemodynamic stability with medical therapy.

Its features, treatment and prognosis are poorly understood. From June 1988 to December 2002, out of 1572 consecutive patients admitted during the first hours of acute myocardial infarction with ST elevation, 7 (5 women, aged 38 +/- 7 years) had DLE. The commonest risk factor was smoking (N = 4). There was a higher incidence of anterior infarction (N = 5). The infarct occurred 7 +/- 5 years after diagnosis of DLE. There were other complications of DLE in all cases. Three patients had antiphospholipid syndromes. The culprit artery was usually the left anterior descending (N = 5). The lesions included stenosing atheroma (N = 5) and extensive thrombosis (N = 5). The coronary disease was usually limited to a single vessel (N = 5). Revascularisation procedures include pre-hospital thrombolysis (N = 3) followed by immediate angioplasty (N = 2) or primary angioplasty (N = 4). TIMI grade 3 flow was obtained in all cases, 278 +/- 162 min after the onset of symptoms.

We retrospectively examined the inhospital outcome of 47 consecutive patients with myocardial infarction < 6 hours and angiographically proven spontaneous patency of the infarct artery managed without initial PTCA. There was one death (2.1%) and no incidence of reinfarction. Predischarge angiography showed regression of the culprit coronary lesion to < 50% stenosis in 23% of the patients, therefore obviating the need for PTCA. However, 17% of the patients had acute recurrent ischemia, requiring emergency intervention in 10.6%. Comparison with matched patients in whom Thrombolysis in Myocardial infarction grade 3 patency was achieved by thrombolysis or by primary PTCA showed that patients with spontaneous patency tended to have smaller infarctions, as judged from a lower peak creatine kinase level (1132 +/- 1002, 2051 +/- 1536, and 2715 +/- 2146 i.u., respectively; p = 0.001) and a higher left ventricular ejection fraction (56.4%, 47.9%, and 48.7% respectively; p = 0.02).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16398150/,[Stem cell therapy in cardiovascular diseases],"Myocardial infarction is the leading cause of congestive heart failure in the industrialized world. Current treatments fail to address the underlying scarring and cell loss, which are the causes of ischaemic heart failure. Recent interest has focused on stem cells, which are undifferentiated and pluripotent cells that can proliferate, potentially self-renew, and differentiate into cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. Myocardial regeneration is the most widely studied and debated example of stem cell plasticity. Early reports from animal and clinical investigations disagree on the extent of myocardial renewal in adults, but evidence indicates that cardiomyocytes were generated in what was previously considered a postmitotic organ. So far, candidates for cardiac stem cell therapy have been limited to patients with acute myocardial infarction and chronic ischaemic heart failure. Currently, bone marrow stem cells seem to be the most attractive cell type for these patients. The cells may be delivered by means of direct surgical injection, intracoronary infusion, retrograde venous infusion, and transendocardial infusion. Stem cells may directly increase cardiac contractility or passively limit infarct expansion and remodeling. Early phase I clinical studies indicate that stem cell transplantation is feasible and may have beneficial effects on ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction.

The extent of ischemic area estimated by electrocardiography and two-dimensional echocardiography, characteristic features of electrocardiographic changes, and clinical findings on admission and outcome were estimated. ST elevation preceded T wave inversion in the same leads in 80% (16/20) of the T group, and transient Q waves developed in 55% (11/20). However, neither ST elevation nor transient Q waves were observed in the ST group. Two or three ischemic segments were present in 86% (19/22) of the ST group patients, but only one ischemic segment was present in 60% (12/20) of T group patients, predominantly the anterior segment. The short-axis view of the two-dimensional echocardiogram on the level of papillary muscle showed decreased contraction in two or three of the anterior, lateral, and inferior segments of the left ventricle in 78% (14/18) of ST group patients. Only one segment with decreased contraction was present in 100% (17/17) of T group patients. Cardiac status on admission was lower in the ST than the T group: Killip class II-IV, 59% (13/22) vs 20% (4/20), p < 0.05; mortality rate after 1 month, 41% (9/22) vs 0% (0/20), p < 0.05. Coronary angiograms, left ventriculograms, and autopsy findings also showed extensive myocardial lesions in accordance with multivessel disease in the ST group, but localized myocardial lesion suggesting one-vessel territory in the T group. T wave inversion in non-Q wave myocardial infarction indicates a recovery phase in transient transmural ischemia and localized subendocardial infarction within the presumed one-vessel territory, while ST depression suggests the presence of extensive ischemia in the subendocardium of multivessel territory, and infarction within that region.",,S Maeda

An increased MPV is associated with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and long-term mortality. The aim of this study was to compare MPV in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Also, we investigated the value of MPV on in-hospital mortality and long-term prognosis of patients with STEMI and NSTEMI. We studied 429 patients with AMI (70.4% male, 61.9 ± 12.4 years; 279 patients with STEMI, 150 patients with NSTEMI). MPV and platelet count were similar in both groups. Elevated MPV increased the risk of death by 3.1-fold (p < 0.001) in STEMI group during the hospitalization. However, increased MPV was not associated with in-hospital mortality in NSTEMI group. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of MPV was 0.868 (95% CI, 0.830-0.907) for predicting two-year mortality. A cut-off point of 11.1 fL showed a sensitivity of 81% and a specifity of 77% for prediction of two-year mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed two-year mortality rate of 12.5% in patients with MPV >11.1 fL versus 9.9% in patients with MPV <11.1 fL (p < 0.001). Cox regression analysis showed MPV to be an independent predictor of two-year mortality (Hazard ratio 1.7; 95% CI 1.5-1.9; p < 0.001). An increased MPV is an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in patients with STEMI. However, elevated levels of MPV did not predict in hospital mortality in NSTEMI group.

Declining rates were observed in all three age groups. The overall acute myocardial infarction incidence rates continued to decline from 2009 onwards, with a steeper decline compared to 2001-2009. During 2009-2014, gender-adjusted acute myocardial infarction incidence among adults age 25-44 years declined 5.3% per year, contributed mostly by declines in hospitalisation rates (5.1% per year). Conclusion Acute myocardial infarction incidence rates continued to decline after 2009 in Norway in both men and women. The decline started to involve individuals aged 25-44 years, marking a turning point in the previously reported stagnation of rates during 2001-2009.",Acute myocardial infarction; Norway; epidemiology; incidence; time trends.,Gerhard Sulo;Jannicke Igland;Stein Emil Vollset;Marta Ebbing;Grace M Egeland;Inger Ariansen;Grethe S Tell
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1552258/,The dilemma of sensitivity versus specificity in computer-interpreted acute myocardial infarction,"The use of thrombolytic therapy and out-of-hospital electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition capability has put even greater importance on the diagnostic accuracy of computerized ECG interpretation programs. Such programs must have extremely high specificity to minimize the possibility of clinicians treating inappropriate patients; thereby needlessly subjecting the patients to the risk of potentially life-threatening complications of the medication. At the same time, studies have shown that both prehospital personnel and emergency department (ED) physicians are aided by automated ECG interpretation programs with high sensitivity. These programs assist the attending personnel in rapidly identifying patients with suspected acute coronary thrombosis, which might otherwise have been undetected or not diagnosed until more obvious ECG abnormalities were present. In previous studies, clinically correlated databases have been used to develop and test sensitivity and specificity of the acute infarction detection algorithm in the Marquette 12SL ECG interpretation program. One program revision resulted in a marked increase in sensitivity (21-53%) without loss of specificity (99.5% to 99%). More recent studies have shown the sensitivity of the interpretation program to be influenced greatly by infarct location with sensitivity lower in anterior than inferior injury. Further refinement of the acute infarction interpretation criteria along with the methodology and data used are presented. Increased sensitivity without appreciable loss of specificity has been possible for detection of both acute inferior and anterior infarction; however, different methods were used for each location. Consideration of reciprocal or concomitant repolarization changes are found to be more useful for inferior than anterior injury. Methodological approaches are presented as they relate to the compromise between sensitivity and specificity.",,P P Elko;W D Weaver;P Kudenchuk;I Rowlandson

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2741824/,Prognosis after acute myocardial infarction in patients with and without residual anterograde coronary blood flow,"The restoration of anterograde coronary flow during the hours to days after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may be beneficial independent of an effect on left ventricular function. This study was done to assess the influence of residual anterograde coronary perfusion on long-term morbidity and mortality in patients after AMI. Over a 10-year period, 179 subjects (132 men, 47 women, aged 25 to 66 years) with infarction and angiographic evidence of disease of only 1 coronary artery were followed for 47 +/- 29 (mean +/- standard deviation) months. All were receiving medical therapy. Sixty-four patients had partial or complete anterograde perfusion of the infarct artery (group I), whereas the other 115 had no or minimal anterograde perfusion (group II). The 2 groups were similar in age, sex, risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, duration of follow-up, maintenance medications and left ventricular function. In group I, unstable angina and congestive heart failure each occurred in less than or equal to 10%, and none died. In marked contrast, the 115 patients in group II frequently had unstable angina (25%) and congestive heart failure (17%) (p less than or equal to 0.05 for both vs group I), and 21 (18%) died suddenly (p less than 0.001 vs group I). Thus, the incidence of long-term morbidity and mortality is greatly increased after AMI in patients without residual anterograde perfusion of the infarct-related coronary artery. In these patients, the restoration of partial or complete anterograde flow--pharmacologically or mechanically--may be beneficial even if it is accomplished hours to days after the acute event.",,R G Cigarroa;R A Lange;L D Hillis

An observational study of 96 patients with suspected myocardial infarction was undertaken over a period of 15 months in the Coronary Care Unit of Hospital Kuala Terengganu. Seventy per cent of the patients arrived in the hospital within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms. After arrival in the emergency room, it took a median time of 85 minutes before the administration of thrombolytic therapy. Of the 67 patients who were given thrombolysis, 46 were treated within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms. About a quarter of patients said that they had delayed seeking treatment at the hospital. Treatment delays occurring in the hospital were mainly due to admission procedures as well as late diagnosis. Eighty-one patients had confirmed myocardial infarction of whom 59 received thrombolytic therapy. Eight patients receiving thrombolytic therapy had no confirmation of myocardial infarctions. Improvements in diagnostic accuracy and reduction of delays in the provision of thrombolytic therapy could be achieved by better training of health care staff as well as by further streamlining of admission procedures.",,Y K Loke;S L Hwang;M H Tan

Nine patients (group I) received streptokinase within 1 hour of the onset of pain, and seven patients (group II) received it within 2 to 3 hours. All underwent multigated radionuclide ventriculography after streptokinase therapy and 1 week later. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the infarct artery was performed within 24 hours in all patients. An effort-limited treadmill stress test was performed before discharge. There was no mortality or serious complication. Mean peak total creatine kinase was 521 +/- 289 mU/ml in group I, and 1,614 +/- 709 mU/ml in group II (p less than 0.05). The mean initial left ventricular ejection fraction was 47 +/- 11% in group I and 37 +/- 10% in group II. After early angioplasty (within 24 hours) and at 1 week recovery, left ventricular ejection fraction increased to 53 +/- 9% in group I (p less than 0.05) and to 40 +/- 7% in group II (p = NS). Seven of the nine patients in group I had normal radionuclide ventriculograms at discharge compared with none of the seven patients in group II. Thrombolytic therapy administered less than 1 hour after the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction followed by angioplasty of the infarct artery results in preservation of left ventricular function, whereas therapy given after 2 hours has only a limited effect.",,H I Miller;Y Almagor;G Keren;J Chernilas;A Roth;Y Eschar;I Shapira;B Shargorodsky;D Berenfeld;S Laniado

The patients were divided according to the infarction type (transmural, non-transmural), the site, (anterior, inferior including posterior) and the absence or presence of ST depression in leads facing the site of infarction. The peak enzyme concentrations were significantly higher in those with transmural infarcts than in those with non-transmural infarcts, in anterior infarcts compared to inferior infarcts, and in those sites with ST depression than those without. The early complications of cardiogenic shock, congestive cardiac failure, and complete heart block were significantly higher in transmural infarcts compared to non-transmural, while late complications and mortality were the same in all groups and subgroups. This study demonstrated that ECG changes in the first acute myocardial infarction are of prognostic significance for the early clinical course, but cannot predict the late course or subsequent coronary events.",,M H Aysha;M A Shayib

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10641957/,Calcium antagonists in the post-myocardial infarction setting,"At present, the use of calcium antagonists for the secondary prevention of cardiac events following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) is not recommended. This advice is based on several large mortality studies using short-acting calcium antagonists in the absence of coronary reperfusion therapy. Even in these studies, discrepancies between the different pharmacological classes of calcium antagonists were recognised. When separated from the dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, the rate-lowering calcium antagonists, verapamil and diltiazem, do appear to provide some benefit in reduction of recurrent MI. Three large trials using verapamil post-MI demonstrated a significant reduction in reinfarction with a favourable trend towards reducing death as well. Similarly, the effects of diltiazem post-MI have been evaluated in 3 large trials. In 2 earlier trials, diltiazem lessened cardiac events in patients with nonQ-wave infarctions and those without pulmonary congestion upon presentation. Overall, there was a significant benefit in lessening reinfarction with no effect on mortality. The recently completed Incomplete Infarction Trial of European Research Collaborators Evaluating Prognosis Post-Infarction (INTERCEPT) trial found that sustained-release diltiazem given after thrombolytic therapy for acute MI lessened cardiac events by 23% (a nonsignificant difference) without worsening congestive symptoms. Overall, there is adequate data to support the use of heart-rate-lowering calcium antagonists for secondary prevention post-MI provided the patient is intolerant of beta-blocker therapy.

Of 283 followed up patients with myocardial infarction III patients were examined by bicycle ergometry (39.2%). 66 patients of the latter group had restored their working capacity (59.4%) and 45 patients (40.6%) were disabled. The mean threshold power in all patients was 87.07 W, in the patients with restored working capacity the threshold power was 100.37 W, in the patients with group II disability it was 51.6 W and in the patients with group III disability it was 88.33 W. The dynamics of the threshold power was followed up by control bicycle ergometric examinations in 2-4 year intervals. In the patients with restored working capacity the threshold power was 107.69 W and in the disabled patients it changed from 70 to 80.83 W.

By investigating the proteins involved in these identified complexes, numerous proteins have been reported that are related to MI, whereas other proteins interacted with MI‑related proteins, which implied that these protein complexes may indeed be related to the development of MI.

From the presently available intravenous agents, urokinase and rT-PA have opening rates of 65 and 60%, respectively. The reperfusion rate as well as the improvement of myocardial infarction are time dependent, resulting in the necessity of reopening the occluded coronary artery within 2.5 h. From the available knowledge, time is not only the most important, but the medically most variable parameter. Thus, the need of early diagnosis and rapid installation of reperfusion result in the necessity of a broader instruction of the public and the treating physicians. Presently ongoing studies will show whether beginning therapy at home or in the ambulance may improve our already extremely promising results achieved today. They will, however, supposedly describe subgroups, i.e., of small inferior infarctions, in which conventional therapy has to be preferred instead of the more aggressive, subtle thrombolysis, PTCA, and cardiac surgery.",,W H Bleifeld

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/986770/,"Cigarette smoking, use of oral contraceptives, and myocardial infarction","The excess risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction among users of oral contraceptives observed in England and Wales can be explained in terms of the high proportion of smokers in the study population. Among nonsmokers, the relative risk associated with the use of oral contraceptives is estimated to be 2 to 1, which is not statistically significant (P = 0.28, Fisher's exact probability test). The present analysis suggests that smoking be considered as another contraindication for the prescription of oral contraceptives. The results further indicate that those women who smoke as well as use oral contraceptives and are interested in reducing the risk of nonfatal mycardial infarction should be encouraged to give up smoking. The relative risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction associated with the use of oral contraceptives observed in a society can vary between 0.9 to 1 and 11.7 to 1, depending upon the proportion of smokers. From the public health point of view, the reduction in the excess risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction achieved by eliminating smoking is estimated to be much more than can be achieved by eliminating the use of oral contraceptives.",,A K Jain

Nine patients in both groups expressed a need for complementary social support, the character differed between the groups concerning emotional and informative support. Both groups reported sufficient social network built on the family. The intervention group expressed more heart trouble compared to the control group at the time of AMI (p = 0.03). 3 months later the trouble had decreased in the intervention group but increased in the control group.

Each patient was followed at least 24 months; 12 patients died and 59 presented major cardiac events (angina, reinfarction and death). All the parameters were analyzed by univariate and discriminant and Cox regression analysis. For purposes of analysis, the predictive power of 3 sets of variables was analyzed separately: Clin, Clin + ET, Clin + ET + Cath. In the prediction of major cardiac events, only previous myocardial infarction was selected among the Clin parameters by multivariate analysis while ST segment depression, maximal systolic blood pressure, exercise duration and, though less significantly, coronary artery disease extension were selected among the ET and Cath var. The percentage of patients correctly classified was very low using only the Clin variables (60%) and significantly improved when ET and, to a lesser degree, Cath were added (77% and 80%, respectively). Multivariate discriminant analysis selected, as significant predictors of cardiac death, digitalis therapy, appearance of bundle branch block, previous myocardial infarction and anterior location of the myocardial infarction among the Clin variables, while exercise duration and LV ejection fraction were selected among the ET and Cath variables, respectively. The predictive power of the Clin variables alone was only slightly improved by the use of ET and Cath as the percentage of patients correctly classified was 76%, 81% and 84% using only the Clin, the Clin + ET and the combination of the Clin + ET + Cath var, respectively. In conclusion, the variables associated with a depressed LV function are the best predictors of future death and cardiac events; coronary angiography can only slightly improve the specificity of the exercise testing in the prediction of major cardiac events.",,L Dei Cas;M Metra;C Cuccia;L Niccoli;S Nodari;O Visioli

Infarction was confirmed in 54 cases compared with 203 in the coronary case unit over the same period. Reasons given for home management were stable condition (48%), diagnostic doubt (34%), patient preference (18%), good home (15%), age (14%). Holter ECGs from 97 patients were analysed to see if arrhythmias were undetected clinically and recordings of at least 20 h were obtained in 88 (91%). Symptoms drew attention to atrial arrhythmias in 5 patients. Ventricular premature beats were recorded in 96% of the AMI group (84% of the non-MI), ventricular tachycardia in 21% of the AMI patients (5% non-MI), atrial fibrillation in 25% of AMI (7% non-MI) and complex ventricular ectopic activity (Lown 3-5) was found in 81% of the AMI (58% of the non-MI). We conclude that the GPs in the Lancaster district select patients for home care of AMI on clinical and social grounds rather than time after onset. Holter ECG recordings reveal major arrhythmias which are usually undetected clinically and are at least as common as those found in CCU treated patients.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11174915/,Depression after myocardial infarction,"Depression is an independent risk factor for increased postmyocardial infarction morbidity and mortality, even after controlling for the extent of coronary artery disease, infarct size, and the severity of left ventricular dysfunction. This risk factor takes on added significance when one considers that almost half of patients recovering from a myocardial infarction have major or minor depression and that major depression alone occurs in about one in five of these individuals. Despite the well-documented risk of depression, questions remain about the mechanism of the relationship between mood disturbance and adverse outcome. The link may be explained by an association with lower levels of social support, poor adherence to recommended medical therapy and lifestyle changes intended to reduce the risk of subsequent cardiac events, disturbances in autonomic tone, enhanced platelet activation and aggregation, and systemic immune activation. Unfortunately, questions about the pathophysiologic mechanism of depression in this setting are paralleled by uncertainties about the optimal treatment of depression for patients recovering from a myocardial infarction and by a lack of knowledge about whether treating depression lowers the associated increased mortality risk. Ongoing research studies will help to determine the benefits of psychosocial interventions and of antidepressant therapy for patients soon after myocardial infarction. Although the identification of depression as a risk factor may by itself be a reason to incorporate a comprehensive psychological evaluation into the routine care of patients with myocardial infarction, this practice should certainly become standard if studies show that treating depression reduces the increased mortality risk of these patients.",,R C Ziegelstein

Twenty three patients with first AMI and 15 healthy volunteers were examined. Of the AMI patients, 14 had extensive infarction (group A), while 9 patients had small infarction (group B). Immunologic analyses were performed at admission, and repeated after 3, 7, 14 and 21 days of the acute event. Following parameters were tested: number of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD20+ cells; serum IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C4, immune complex and anticardiac antibody levels; polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) function (chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activity); leukocyte migration in vitro in the presence of water-soluble homologous heart extract. It was demonstrated that the number of B cells, serum IgG, C3, immune complex and anticardiac antibody levels were elevated from 7th-14th days after AMI. Concerning these parameters, however, no significant differences were obtained between group A and group B of AMI patients. Chemotaxis and metabolic activity of peripheral blood PMN, but not phagocytosis, were enhanced during AMI, again changes of PMN did not correlate with the extension of infarction. In contrast, leukocyte migration inhibition in vitro revealed that only patients with extensive AMI have developed positive reaction during the first 14 days after the onset of the disease, while leukocyte inhibition reaction appeared in patients with nonextensive AMI not earlier than the 21st day after the infarction. These findings demonstrate generation of immune reactivity during AMI and indicate that humoral immune response seems more likely to be an epiphenomenon related to tissue necrosis, while cell-mediated immune reactions could influence the extensiveness of cardiac damage.",,M Dimitrijevic;Z Vasiljevic;L Vuckovic-Dekic;S Spasic

Regional end-diastolic segment lengths and wall thicknesses for anterior and posterior left ventricular walls were calculated. Eight patients showed infarct expansion, with disproportionate dilatation and transmural thinning in the infarcted zone, that was significantly different (P less than 0.005) from changes in non-infarcted regions. This regional expansion led to an overall left ventricular dilatation in these eight patients of 25 per cent compared to 5 per cent in the 20 patients without infarct expansion. Although the eight patients with regional expansion did not have significantly higher peak creatine kinase or Killip classification, they had a significantly greater eight-week mortality (four of eight versus none of 20, P less than 0.004). Thus, regional cardiac dilatation may be an early, lethal consequence of transmural infarcts, and appears to be an important mechanism of acute cardiac dilatation after myocardial infarction.",,L W Eaton;J L Weiss;B H Bulkley;J B Garrison;M L Weisfeldt

Of 11,872 patients enrolled in the Korean Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry from November 2005 to January 2008, we studied patients with NSTEMI undergoing early invasive intervention (n = 1,486) and those with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 4,392). Multivessel coronary disease, baseline Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade 3, and the left circumflex artery as a culprit lesion occurred more frequently in patients with NSTEMI than in those with STEMI. Those with NSTEMI had a significantly lower mortality rate than those with STEMI during a median follow-up of about 12 months (3.8% vs 6.7%, p <0.001). In the patients with NSTEMI, the independent predictors of mortality included postprocedural TIMI flow grade 0 to 2 (hazard ratio [HR] 3.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 9.29, p = 0.047) and multivessel coronary disease (HR 3.83, 95% CI 1.36 to 10.81, p = 0.010) but not baseline TIMI flow or infarct location. However, baseline TIMI flow grade 0 to 2 (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.36, p = 0.035), anterior infarction (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.23, p <0.001), multivessel coronary disease (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.91, p = 0.008), and postprocedural TIMI flow grade 0 to 2 (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.82, p <0.001) were all independent predictors of mortality in the patients with STEMI.

The therapies used in these patients should reduce the progression of the left ventricular dysfunction to refractory heart failure. In order to prevent post-myocardial infarction cardiac remodelling, different therapies have been tested, and for ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers a clear demonstration of efficacy has been obtained. Losartan and valsartan, two widely used angiotensin receptor blockers, demonstrated to be safe and equally useful compared to ACEI. The addition of spironolactone to the standard therapy for heart failure has a clear beneficial effect but the clinical use has been refrained by the risk of iperkaliemia. Aerobic physical training improves the left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with systolic dysfunction, reducing the progressive enlargement after myocardial infarction. The positive effect of aerobic training on cardiac remodelling might be related to the positive effect on neurhormonal assessment, to he improvement of microcirculatory myocardial perfusion and of endothelial function.",,Camillo Taglieri;Enrico Lombardo;Mauro Feola

However, a few studies have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of direct stenting compared to conventional stent implantation technique. This study was designed to compare possible advantages of direct stenting with conventional stent implantation on immediate coronary blood flow and short-term clinical benefits in patients with AMI. Fifty patients with AMI who underwent mechanical revascularization were eligible for the study. The patients were randomly assigned to undergo either direct stenting (n = 25) or conventional stent implantation (n = 25). Before and after the procedure thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow and postprocedural corrected TIMI frame count (cTFC) of the infarct-related artery were measured. There was no difference in TIMI flow distribution at baseline between the 2 groups. TIMI 3 flow rate significantly increased after procedure in both groups compared to baseline (p < 0.05). Postprocedural cTFC was found significantly lower in the direct stent arm compared to conventional stenting (p < 0.001). Both during and after the procedure the complication rate and procedural time were lower in the direct stenting arm. Direct stenting provides better immediate coronary blood flow and is a safe and feasible method compared with conventional stenting in patients with AMI.

MONICA project, Toulouse]","The aim of this study, based on the data of the MONICA register in the Haute-Garonne, was to compare the prognosis and treatment of myocardial infarction between 1986 (253 cases) and 1989 (248 cases). The clinical features of these infarcts were comparable except for the previous history of ischaemic heart disease which was less common in 1989 (34.7% in 1986, 25.9% in 1989; p < 0.05). The 28th day mortality decreased from 8.4% in 1986 to 3.6% in 1989 without attaining statistical significance. The pre-hospital management was the same during the two periods of the study, with 67.6% of patients admitted to hospital before the 6th hour. Hospital care in 1986 and 1989 consisted of 5 days in the intensive care unit and lasted 14 days. Treatment changed considerably from 1986 to 1989. There was a higher incidence of platelet antiaggregant prescriptions (47.4% in 1986 and 80% in 1989; p < 0.001), of betablocker prescriptions (30.8% in 1986 and 47% in 1989; p < 0.05) and fibrinolytics (27.8% in 1986 and 52% in 1989; p < 0.01). Invasive procedures such as coronary angiography (83.5% in 1986 and 94% in 1989; p < 0.05), coronary angioplasty (20.3% in 1986 and 53.5% in 1989; p < 0.01) were undertaken in the majority of cases. The MONICA-Toulouse project shows a reduction in mortality and an increase in the use of therapeutic methods known to be effective in the reduction of mortality in myocardial infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,J Ferrières;J P Cambou;J B Ruidavets;P Douste-Blazy;J L Richard
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27806987/,Assessment and classification of patients with myocardial injury and infarction in clinical practice,"Myocardial injury is common in patients without acute coronary syndrome, and international guidelines recommend patients with myocardial infarction are classified by aetiology. The universal definition differentiates patients with myocardial infarction due to plaque rupture (type 1) from those due to myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance (type 2) secondary to other acute illnesses. Patients with myocardial necrosis, but no symptoms or signs of myocardial ischaemia, are classified as acute or chronic myocardial injury. This classification has not been widely adopted in practice, because the diagnostic criteria for type 2 myocardial infarction encompass a wide range of presentations, and the implications of the diagnosis are uncertain. However, both myocardial injury and type 2 myocardial infarction are common, occurring in more than one-third of all hospitalised patients. These patients have poor short-term and long-term outcomes with two-thirds dead in 5 years. The classification of patients with myocardial infarction continues to evolve, and future guidelines are likely to recognise the importance of identifying coronary artery disease in type 2 myocardial infarction. Clinicians should consider whether coronary artery disease has contributed to myocardial injury, as selected patients are likely to benefit from further investigation and in these patients targeted secondary prevention has the potential to improve outcomes.",,Andrew R Chapman;Philip D Adamson;Nicholas L Mills

We evaluated on-treatment platelet reactivity (PR) and several gene polymorphisms related to PR in 130 patients undergoing PCI with and without COPD. Those with concomitant COPD showed higher on-treatment PR values both at the time of PCI and 1 month after. This finding may contribute to explain the poor prognosis of COPD patients after MI and PCI.,COPD epidemiology.,Gianluca Campo;Rita Pavasini;Alberto Pollina;Matteo Tebaldi;Roberto Ferrari
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21325342/,Acute myocardial infarction complication diagnosed by three-dimensional echocardiography,"Transthoracic echocardiography is the modality of choice for the bedside diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction mechanical complications. We report the case of a ventricular septal rupture occurring soon after inferior myocardial infarction, revascularized by primary angioplasty. This challenging diagnosis was elucidated by 3D-echocardiography as 2D-imaging was not conclusive. This case demonstrates the importance of 3D-echocardiography in a cardiac intensive care setting. It provided additional information to 2D-echocardiography by identifying and locating post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) septal rupture with implications for planning surgery.",,João Silva Marques;Cláudia Jorge;Susana Robalo Martins;Ana Feijão;António Nunes Diogo
