https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30648539/,Severe asthma in children: Evaluation and management,"Severe asthma in children is associated with significant morbidity. Children with severe asthma are at increased risk for adverse outcomes including medication-related side effects, life-threatening exacerbations, and impaired quality of life. It is important to differentiate between severe therapy resistant asthma and difficult-to-treat asthma due to comorbidities. The most common problems that need to be excluded before a diagnosis of severe asthma can be made are poor medication adherence, poor medication technique or incorrect diagnosis of asthma. Difficult to treat asthma is a much more common reason for persistent symptoms and exacerbations and can be managed if comorbidities are clearly addressed. Children with persistent symptoms and exacerbations despite correct inhaler technique and good medical adherence to standard Step 4 asthma therapies according to the guidelines1,2, should be referred to an asthma specialist with expertise in severe asthma.",Asthma evaluation; Asthma management; Difficult to treat asthma; Pediatric severe asthma; Severe asthma evaluation.,Mehtap Haktanir Abul;Wanda Phipatanakul

The most frequently reported asthma comorbid conditions include rhinitis, sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, hormonal disorders and psychopathologies. These conditions may, first: share a common pathophysiological mechanism with asthma; second: influence asthma control, its phenotype and response to treatment; and third: be more prevalent in asthmatic patients but without obvious influence on this disease. For many of these, how they interact with asthma remains to be further documented, particularly for severe asthma. If considered relevant, they should, however, be treated appropriately. Further research is needed on the relationships between these conditions and asthma.",,Louis-Philippe Boulet;Marie-Ève Boulay

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31678077/,Recent Advances in Severe Asthma: From Phenotypes to Personalized Medicine,"This review focuses on recent clinical and translational discoveries in severe and uncontrolled asthma that now enable phenotyping and personalized therapies in these patients. Although asthma is common in both children and adults and typically responds to standard therapies, a subset of individuals with asthma experience severe and/or persistent symptoms despite appropriate therapies. Airflow obstruction leading to frequent symptoms requiring higher levels of controller therapy is the cardinal feature of severe asthma, but the underlying molecular mechanisms, or endotypes, are diverse and variable between individuals. Two major risk factors that contribute to severe asthma are genetics and environmental exposures that modulate immune responses, and although these often interact in complex manners that are not fully understood, certain endotypes converge in severe asthma. A number of studies have evaluated various features of patients with severe asthma and classified patients into phenotypes with clinical relevance. This phenotyping is now incorporated into clinical practice and can be used to guide advanced biological therapies that target specific molecules and inflammatory pathways that contribute to asthma pathogenesis.",asthma; endotype; phenotype; severe asthma.,Nathan Schoettler;Mary E Strek

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31690376/,Classification of asthma,"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways that results, physiologically, in hyperreactivity and, clinically, in recurrent episodes of wheezing, chest tightness, or coughing. Airway inflammation, smooth-muscle contraction, epithelial sloughing, mucous hypersecretion, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and mucosal edema contribute to the underlying pathophysiology of asthma. Diagnostic tests such as methacholine or mannitol challenges or spirometry (pre- and postbronchodilator responses) help to identify such underlying pathophysiology via assessments of bronchial hyperreactivity and lung mechanics but are imperfect and, ultimately, must be viewed in the context of a patient's clinical presentation, including response to pharmacotherapy. Asthma can be classified into either intermittent or persistent, and the latter is either mild, moderate, or severe. Some patients change, in either direction, from intermittent to persistent asthma. In addition, patients with asthma may be classified as allergic (immunoglobulin E mediated), nonallergic (often triggered by viral upper respiratory tract infections or no apparent cause), occupational, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, potentially fatal, exercise-induced, and cough variant asthma. In the latter, the patients have a nonproductive cough that responds to treatment for asthma but not with antibiotics, expectorants, mucolytics, antitussives, or beta₂-adrenergic agonists, and to treatment for acid reflux and rhinosinusitis. Thus, cough variant asthma is in the differential diagnosis of chronic cough.",,Nurcicek Padem;Carol Saltoun
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29273246/,Asthma,"Asthma-one of the most common chronic, non-communicable diseases in children and adults-is characterised by variable respiratory symptoms and variable airflow limitation. Asthma is a consequence of complex gene-environment interactions, with heterogeneity in clinical presentation and the type and intensity of airway inflammation and remodelling. The goal of asthma treatment is to achieve good asthma control-ie, to minimise symptom burden and risk of exacerbations. Anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator treatments are the mainstay of asthma therapy and are used in a stepwise approach. Pharmacological treatment is based on a cycle of assessment and re-evaluation of symptom control, risk factors, comorbidities, side-effects, and patient satisfaction by means of shared decisions. Asthma is classed as severe when requiring high-intensity treatment to keep it under control, or if it remains uncontrolled despite treatment. New biological therapies for treatment of severe asthma, together with developments in biomarkers, present opportunities for phenotype-specific interventions and realisation of more personalised treatment. In this Seminar, we provide a clinically focused overview of asthma, including epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical diagnosis, asthma phenotypes, severe asthma, acute exacerbations, and clinical management of disease in adults and children older than 5 years.

Prevalence has continued to rise in recent decades as Western dietary patterns have become more pervasive. Evidence suggests that diets emphasizing the consumption of plant-based foods might protect against asthma development and improve asthma symptoms through their effects on systemic inflammation, oxidation, and microbial composition. Additionally, increased fruit and vegetable intake, reduced animal product consumption, and weight management might mediate cytokine release, free radical damage, and immune responses involved in the development and course of asthma. The specific aim of this review paper is to examine the current literature on the associations between dietary factors and asthma risk and control in children and adults.

Children with severe asthma may fall into 2 categories, difficult-to-treat asthma or severe therapy-resistant asthma. Difficult-to-treat asthma is defined as poor control due to an incorrect diagnosis or comorbidities, or poor adherence due to adverse psychological or environmental factors. In contrast, treatment resistant is defined as difficult asthma despite management of these factors. It is increasingly recognized that severe asthma is a highly heterogeneous disorder associated with a number of clinical and inflammatory phenotypes that have been described in children with severe asthma. Guideline-based drug therapy of severe childhood asthma is based primarily on extrapolated data from adult studies. The recommendation is that children with severe asthma be treated with higher-dose inhaled or oral corticosteroids combined with long-acting β-agonists and other add-on therapies, such as antileukotrienes and methylxanthines. It is important to identify and address the influences that make asthma difficult to control, including reviewing the diagnosis and removing causal or aggravating factors.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31690379/,Asthma in adults: Principles of treatment,"The goals of treatment are prevention of fatalities, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits, along with achieving good long-term control of asthma, with reduction of symptoms, maintenance of normal activity level, prevention of exacerbations and accelerated loss of pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration [FEV1]), and avoidance of harm from therapies. Treatment is often initiated based on the severity of symptoms, physical examination findings, and, for some patients, the FEV1 or peak expiratory flow rates. Comorbidities such as gastroesophageal reflux disease and laryngopharyngeal reflux, rhinitis or rhinosinusitis, sleep apnea, recurrent infections, smoking, and substance abuse should be addressed. Two treatment modalities are indicated only for individuals with allergic asthma: allergen-specific immunotherapy (commonly known as allergy shots), and biologic therapies that target type-2 (T2) inflammation. Allergen immunotherapy is effective in decreasing symptoms and medication use in select patients with mild-to-moderate allergic asthma. In addition, patients who receive allergen immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis may have a decreased risk of developing asthma. Omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, and dupilumab are monoclonal antibodies that target T2 inflammation and are indicated for either moderate-to-severe or severe asthma. These have been well studied to improve asthma symptoms and have specific characteristics unique to each individual medication.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31277742/,Phenotypes and endotypes of adult asthma: Moving toward precision medicine,"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that is challenging to dissect into subgroups because of the heterogeneity present across the spectrum of the disease. Efforts to subclassify asthma using advanced computational methods have identified a number of different phenotypes that suggest that multiple pathobiologically driven clusters of disease exist. The main phenotypes that have been identified include (1) early-onset allergic asthma, (2) early-onset allergic moderate-to-severe remodeled asthma, (3) late-onset nonallergic eosinophilic asthma, and (4) late-onset nonallergic noneosinophilic asthma. Subgroups of these phenotypes also exist but have not been as consistently identified. Advances in our understanding of the diverse immunologic perturbations that drive airway inflammation are consistent with clinical traits associated with these phenotypes and their response to biologic therapies. This has improved the clinician's approach to characterizing asthmatic patients in the clinic. Being able to define asthma endotypes using clinical characteristics and biomarkers will move physicians toward even more personalized management of asthma and precision-based care in the future.

There are important age-related physiologic and immunologic changes that complicate the presentation, diagnosis, and management of asthma in the aged population. Evidence suggests that elderly asthmatics are more likely to be underdiagnosed and undertreated. Additionally, elderly patients with asthma have highest rates of morbidity and mortality from their disease than younger patients. The underlying airway inflammation of asthma in this age group likely differs from younger patients and is felt to be non-type 2 mediated. While elderly patients are underrepresented in clinical trials, subgroup analysis of large clinical trials suggests they may be less likely to respond to traditional asthma therapies (ie, corticosteroids).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26068579/,Asthma Bronchiale and Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction,"Exercising regularly has a wide range of beneficial health effects; in particular, it has been well documented to help in the management of chronic illnesses including asthma. However, in some individuals, exertion can also trigger an exacerbation of asthmatic episodes and subsequent acute attacks of breathlessness, coughing, tightness of the chest and wheezing. This physiological process is called exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) whereby post-exercise forced expiratory volume in 1 s is reduced by 10-15% from baseline. While EIB is highly prevalent in asthmatics and presents with similar respiratory symptoms, asthma and EIB are not mutually exclusive. The aim of this review is to present a broad overview of both conditions in order to enhance the understanding of the similarities and differences distinguishing them as two separate entities. The pathophysiology and mechanisms underlying asthma are well described with research now focussing on defining phenotypes for targeted management strategies. Conversely, the mechanistic understanding of EIB remains largely under-described. Diagnostic pathways for both are established and similar, as are pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments and management approaches, which have enhanced success with early detection. Given the potential for exacerbation of asthma, exercise avoidance is common but counterproductive as current evidence indicates that it is well tolerated and improves quality of life. Literature supporting the benefit of exercise for EIB sufferers is at present favourable, yet extremely limited; therefore, future research should be directed in this area as well as towards further developing the understanding of the pathophysiology and mechanisms underpinning both EIB and asthma.",,Harshani Jayasinghe;Zoe Kopsaftis;Kristin Carson

This review will discuss the challenges to diagnosis and management of asthma in older adults. Data Sources: PubMed was searched for multiple terms in various combinations, including asthma, older adult, elderly, comorbid conditions, asthma diagnosis, asthma treatment, biologics and medication side effects, and adverse events. From the search, the data sources that were utilized included peer reviewed scholarly review articles, peer reviewed scientific research articles, and peer reviewed book chapters. Study Selections: Study selections that were utilized included peer reviewed scholarly review articles, peer reviewed scientific research articles, and peer reviewed book chapters. Results: Asthma in older adults is frequently underdiagnosed and has higher morbidity and mortality rates compared to their younger counterparts. A detailed history and physical examination as well as judicious testing are essential to establish the asthma diagnosis and exclude alternative ones. Medical comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, depression, arthritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), rhinitis, and sinusitis are common in this population and should also be assessed and treated. Non-pharmacologic management, including asthma education on inhaler technique and self-monitoring, is vital. Pharmacologic management includes standard asthma therapies such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), inhaled corticosteroid-long acting β-agonist combinations (ICS-LABA), leukotriene antagonists, long acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), and short acting bronchodilators (SABA). Newly approved biologic agents may also be utilized. Older adults are more vulnerable to polypharmacy and medication adverse events, and this should be taken into account when selecting the appropriate asthma treatment. Conclusions: The diagnosis and management of asthma in older adults has certain challenges, but if the clinician is aware of them, the morbidity and mortality of this condition can be improved in this growing population.",ACOS; Asthma; COPD; diagnosis; education; elderly; older adult; treatment.,Anil Nanda;Alan P Baptist;Rohit Divekar;Neil Parikh;Joram S Seggev;Joseph S Yusin;Sharmilee M Nyenhuis

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31079340/,The Impact of Environmental Chronic and Toxic Stress on Asthma,"Several factors have been associated with the development of asthma and asthma-related morbidity and mortality. Exposures in the environment such as allergens and air pollutants have traditionally been linked to the risk of asthma and asthma outcomes. More recent literature has identified chronic psychosocial stress as an additional environmental exposure to consider in relation to asthma. Adverse childhood events (ACEs) and chronic and toxic stress have been associated with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Chronic stress has also been shown to result in biological changes such as expression of immunologic genes, changes in expression of the beta-adrenergic (B2AR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR-α) genes, cytokine regulation, and alterations in the hypothalamic pituitary axis and cortisol levels which all may affect asthma pathophysiology and therapeutic response among patients exposed to chronic stress. Recent research has revealed associations between ACEs and chronic and toxic stress and asthma risk in pre-conception to early childhood as well as morbidity and response to asthma treatments among pediatric and adult age groups. As some populations are more significantly impacted by asthma such as racial and ethnic minority groups, the influence of psychosocial stress has also been explored as a potential factor responsible for observed disparities in asthma prevalence and outcomes among these groups which also experience higher rates of psychosocial stress. Racial discrimination has specifically been shown to affect asthma-related outcomes among minority groups. Interventions to address the impact of chronic and toxic stress such as yoga and meditation have been shown to improve asthma outcome measures. Chronic and toxic stress is an important environmental exposure to further consider as we continue to explore the differences in underlying asthma pathophysiology leading to various disease phenotypes among patients and clinical/therapeutic response to interventions and treatments.",Adverse childhood events; Allergic disease; Asthma; Chronic stress; Racial discrimination; Toxic stress.,Maggie Barnthouse;Bridgette L Jones
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29981459/,"Is aging a ""comorbidity"" of asthma?","The aging population is growing at an unparalleled rate. Asthma is common in the elderly (age over 65 years) and can be more severe with little chance for remission. Asthma in older individuals is often under-diagnosed, misdiagnosed and frequently under-treated. Concomitant medical and psychosocial conditions are more prevalent in the elderly and can obfuscate the presentation of asthma and make it more difficult to assess and manage. While these comorbidities are important in understanding elderly asthma, aging itself can be considered a ""comorbidity"" since it impacts structural and functional changes in the lung. Structural changes of the aging lung may worsen physiologic function in asthma. The immune system also changes with age, with increased vulnerability to pathogens and differences in airway inflammation, leading to variability in how asthma manifests and responds to treatment. The fact that aging can influence the severity and presentation of asthma along with its diagnosis and management is important for the treating physician to understand.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30294851/,Equine asthma: Integrative biologic relevance of a recently proposed nomenclature,"The term ""equine asthma"" has been proposed as a unifying descriptor of inflammatory airway disease (IAD), recurrent airway obstruction (RAO), and summer pasture-associated obstructive airway disease. Whilst the term will increase comprehensibility for both the lay and scientific communities, its biologic relevance must be compared and contrasted to asthma in human medicine, recognizing the limited availability of peer-reviewed equine-derived data, which are largely restricted to clinical signs, measures of airway obstruction and inflammation and response to therapy. Such limitations constrain meaningful comparisons with human asthma phenotypes. Suggested minimum inclusion criteria supporting the term asthma, as well as similarities and differences between IAD, RAO, and multiple human asthma phenotypes are discussed. Furthermore, differences between phenotype and severity are described, and typical features for equine asthma subcategories are proposed. Based on shared features, we conclude that mild/moderate (IAD) and severe (RAO) equine asthma are biologically appropriate models for both allergic and non-allergic human asthma, with RAO (severe equine asthma) also being an appropriate model for late-onset asthma. With the development of new biologic treatments in humans and the application of more targeted therapeutic approaches in the horse, it would appear appropriate to further investigate the allergic (Th-2) and non-allergic (non-Th-2) phenotypes of equine asthma.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29928921/,Paucigranulocytic asthma: Uncoupling of airway obstruction from inflammation,"Among patients with asthma, heterogeneity exists regarding the pattern of airway inflammation and response to treatment, prompting the necessity of recognizing specific phenotypes. Based on the analysis of inflammatory cell counts in induced sputum, asthmatic patients can be classified into 4 unique phenotypes: eosinophilic asthma, neutrophilic asthma, mixed granulocytic asthma, and paucigranulocytic asthma (PGA). PGA is an asthma phenotype with no evidence of increased numbers of eosinophils or neutrophils in sputum or blood and in which anti-inflammatory therapies are ineffective at controlling symptoms. Although underinvestigated, PGA is the most common asthma phenotype in patients with stable asthma. However, PGA is sometimes underestimated because of the exclusive reliance on induced sputum cell counts, which are variable among cohorts of studies, prompting the necessity of developing improved biomarkers. Importantly, investigators have reported that inhaled corticosteroids had a limited effect on airway inflammatory markers in patients with PGA and therefore defining PGA as a potentially ""steroid-insensitive"" phenotype that requires exploration of alternative therapies. PGA manifests as an uncoupling of airway obstruction from airway inflammation that can be driven by structural changes within the airways, such as airway smooth muscle tissue hypertrophy. Animal models provide evidence that processes evoking airway hyperresponsiveness and airway smooth muscle thickening occur independent from inflammation and might be a consequence of a loss of negative homeostatic processes. Collectively, further understanding of PGA with a focus on the characterization, prevalence, clinical significance, and pathobiology derived from animal studies will likely provide precision therapies that will improve PGA clinical outcomes.",Irreversible airway obstruction; airway remodeling; airway smooth muscle; asthma endotypes; asthma phenotypes; biomarkers; precision medicine; steroid insensitivity; structural cells.,Omar Tliba;Reynold A Panettieri Jr

Several guidelines and/or consensus documents are available to support medical decisions on pediatric asthma. Although there is no doubt that the use of common systematic approaches for management can considerably improve outcomes, dissemination and implementation of these are still major challenges. Consequently, the International Collaboration in Asthma, Allergy and Immunology (iCAALL), recently formed by the EAACI, AAAAI, ACAAI, and WAO, has decided to propose an International Consensus on (ICON) Pediatric Asthma. The purpose of this document is to highlight the key messages that are common to many of the existing guidelines, while critically reviewing and commenting on any differences, thus providing a concise reference. The principles of pediatric asthma management are generally accepted. Overall, the treatment goal is disease control. To achieve this, patients and their parents should be educated to optimally manage the disease, in collaboration with healthcare professionals. Identification and avoidance of triggers is also of significant importance. Assessment and monitoring should be performed regularly to re-evaluate and fine-tune treatment. Pharmacotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment. The optimal use of medication can, in most cases, help patients control symptoms and reduce the risk for future morbidity. The management of exacerbations is a major consideration, independent of chronic treatment.

Accurate clinical assessment from the history and physical examination is very important to assess the severity of the disease. Some measure of airway resistance of either FEV1 or PEFR should be done in every patient initially, at repeated intervals, and at discharge, to have a parameter to follow in therapy as well as a tool to use to warn the physician of a severe amount of airway obstruction. The inhaled beta agonists are the first line of therapy in acute asthma and can be delivered by either the nebulizer or the MDI with or without a spacer. Aminophylline will be continued to be used acutely even though it appears there is no improvement in bronchospasm in the first few hours of treatment when aminophylline is added to therapy. Anticholinergic agents will gain a wider role in acute asthma, especially when used in combination with a beta agonist. Corticosteroids continue to have a role in severe attacks of asthma, and earlier use may prevent relapse. Fatal asthma still occurs, however, and the emergency physician must use strict criteria to recognize status asthmaticus or the patient who is not doing well and admit them to the hospital.

There is ongoing debate over whether ACO is a discrete clinical entity, or if it is part of a continuum of airways disease. Furthermore, there is considerable variation among current definitions of ACO, which makes diagnosis potentially challenging for clinicians. Treating ACO may be equally challenging because ACO is an understudied population, and the evidence base for its management comes largely from asthma and COPD studies, the relevance of which deserves careful consideration. In this review, we synthesize the various approaches to ACO diagnosis and evaluate the role of currently available diagnostic tests. We describe the potential benefits of existing asthma and COPD therapies in treating patients with ACO, and the value of a ""treatable traits"" approach to ACO management.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8746278/,Asthma,"Bronchial asthma is now recognised to be a major cause of morbidity and even mortality in people of all ages. Two important ideas have changed our approach to asthma management. The first is understanding that asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder which needs regular treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs such as inhaled corticosteroids to prevent further attacks. The second development is the availability of prescribable peak flow meters, which allows both confident diagnosis and early prediction of relapse. Asthma management guidelines provide a logical treatment framework for most patients, but a few difficult cases still consume large amounts of medical time. The commonest problem is one of compliance with treatment which may respond to patient education, although this is not universally so. Other problems include misdiagnosis, acid reflux and, rarely, true corticosteroid-resistant asthma. Several potentially important new treatments have been developed. These include longer acting anticholinergic drugs, drugs with bronchodilator and some anti-inflammatory properties which antagonise or inhibit the production of leukotrienes, sub-types of phosphodiesterase inhibitor with anti-inflammatory properties and immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin.

With more precise asthma phenotypes, association studies likely will have greater significance. In addition, patients at higher risk for severe disease can be more effectively managed, and treatments can be directed to responders. In this review, we look at eight identified phenotypes: atopic and nonatopic status, pre-asthma wheezing, inflammatory mediator predominance, aspirin-sensitive, exercise-induced, severe, and flare-prone asthma.

Factors that can influence asthma control, such as environmental exposures, comorbid conditions, treatment adherence, and in particular inhalation technique must be recognized and considered appropriately before confirming the diagnosis of severe asthma. Objective criteria are important in the follow-up evaluation of severe asthma. They must include the measurement of some disease components. During follow-up, it is recommended that patients be monitored by validated questionnaires about quality of life and asthma control and by pulmonary function measurements, airway inflammation assessment, and recording the frequency of exacerbations and healthcare system use (including whether planned or unexpected).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9864023/,Difficult asthma,"Asthma is usually easy to manage, but approximately 5% of patients are not controlled even on high doses of inhaled corticosteroids. It is important to assess these patients carefully in order to identify whether there are any correctable factors that may contribute to their poor control. It is critical to make a diagnosis of asthma and to exclude other airway diseases, particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and vocal cord dysfunction (""pseudo-asthma""). Poor adherence to therapy, particularly inhaled corticosteroids, is a common reason for a poor response. There may be unidentified exacerbating factors, including unrecognized allergens, occupational sensitizers, dietary additives, drugs, gastro-oesophageal reflux, upper airway disease, or other systemic diseases, that need to be identified and avoided or treated. Psychological factors may be important in some patients, but it is difficult to know whether these are causal or secondary to troublesome disease. Some patients have instability of their asthma, with resistant nocturnal asthma, premenstrual exacerbations or chaotic and unpredictable instability (brittle asthma). A few patients are completely resistant to corticosteroids, but more patients are relatively resistant and require relatively high doses of corticosteroids to control their symptoms (steroid-dependent). Some patients develop progressive loss of lung function, as in patients with COPD. Management of patients with difficult asthma should be supervised by a respiratory specialist and should involve careful assessment to confirm a diagnosis of asthma, identification and treatment of exacerbating factors, particularly allergens, and recording of peak expiratory flow patterns. A period of hospital admission may be the best way to assess and manage these patients. Treatment involves optimizing corticosteroids therapy, assessing additional controllers such as long-acting inhaled or subcutaneous beta2-agonists or subcutaneous, theophylline and antileukotrienes.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8597082/,Occupational asthma,"Occupational asthma is an important occupational respiratory disorder, both in terms of morbidity, disability and in the total number of cases. The two types of occupational asthma are classified on the basis of their temporal relationship to onset. Occupational asthma with latency reflects allergic occupational asthma and is a condition characterized by a preceding latent period of workplace exposure during which allergic sensitization to a material present at the work site occurs. It is characterized biochemically by immunologic alterations and physiologically by variable and work-related airflow limitation with the presence of both specific and nonspecific airway hyperresponsiveness. In contrast, occupational asthma without latency is an asthmatic condition that develops suddenly and without a preceding latent period, as epitomized by the reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS). RADS is distinguished physiologically by chronic, persistent nonspecific airway hyperresponsiveness and usually occurs after a single brief high-level exposure to an irritant gas, vapor of fume; new information suggests that a more prolonged irritant exposure, in certain susceptible persons with a pre-existing allergic predisposition, can also lead to the initiation of new-onset asthma. The factors that may be influential in the pathogenesis of occupational asthma include: exposure characteristics, industrial factors, job attributes, geographic and climatic conditions, economic considerations and personal or host conditions, such as atopy and cigarette smoking. Preventive measures and opportunities for intervention are essential and must address plans for reducing or eliminating accidents and spills, as well as plans for engineering control methods and proper and effective local exhaust ventilation. Medical surveillance programs are the keystone for prevention and should identify persons who are at an increased risk for developing occupational asthma, as well as detecting asthma at an early stage when intervention options are likely to be successful.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21944687/,Asthma: 2015 and beyond,"Asthma is a multifactorial, chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. The knowledge that asthma is an inflammatory disorder has become a core fundamental in the definition of asthma. Asthma's chief features include a variable degree of air-flow obstruction and bronchial hyper-responsiveness, in addition to the underlying chronic airways inflammation. This underlying chronic airway inflammation substantially contributes to airway hyper-responsiveness, air-flow limitation, respiratory symptoms, and disease chronicity. However, this underlying chronic airway inflammation has implications for the diagnosis, management, and potential prevention of the disease. This review for the respiratory therapy community summarizes these developments as well as providing an update on asthma epidemiology, natural history, cause, and pathogenesis.

In JPGL, JPGL2017 is the first evidence-based guidelines updated according to the GRADE system and Minds approach, and it addresses eight clinical questions about the treatment of childhood asthma. In children aged ≤5 years, infant and preschool asthma is diagnosed according to the response to short acting beta2 agonists or the effect of a therapeutic trial during 1 month with controller treatment and worsening after treatment cessation. Long-term management both promotes pharmacological therapy and measures against risk factors that induce exacerbation, better patient education and a partnership with trinity. In addition, long-term management should not be carried out without review but rather be based on a cycle of evaluation, adjustment and treatment. In JPGL2017, the transdermal patch and oral beta2 agonists are positioned as drugs within the concept of ""short-term additional treatment"" to be used until the symptoms are stabilized when the control state transiently deteriorates.",Asthma; Childhood; GRADE system; Guidelines; Wheeze.,Hirokazu Arakawa;Yuichi Adachi;Motohiro Ebisawa;Takao Fujisawa;Committee for Japanese Pediatric Guideline for Childhood Asthma;Japanese Society of Pediatric Allergy and Clinical Immunology;Japanese Society of Allergology

These cells release proinflammatory cytokine mediators that augment and regulate airway inflammation, leading to airway hyperresponsiveness responsible for the chronic asthma symptoms of dyspnea, wheezing, and chest tightness. It is hypothesized, but unproven, that inflammatory effects can lead to irreversible structural and functional airway changes. Early intervention with anti-inflammatory agents mitigates inflammatory changes, reverses airway obstruction, and may possibly prevent progression of airway remodeling. Current asthma guidelines recommend that initial management should be based on pretreatment assessments of asthma severity as determined by measures of clinical and spirometric impairment in individual patients; subsequent adjustments of pharmacotherapy and avoidance recommendations should be performed at regular follow-up visits and guided by frequent assessments of asthma control. Physicians and providers should continually educate asthmatic patients about proper use of asthma controller medications, avoidance of asthma triggers, and self-management of asthma exacerbations.",,David I Bernstein

Children with asthma who cough have also been shown to have increased cough receptor sensitivity during an acute exacerbation. Cough severity does not generally correlate with asthma severity. Apart from wheeze and dyspnoea, there are no clear distinguishing features to separate asthma from non-specific cough. To date, no specific treatment has clearly been shown to benefit children with non-specific cough.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12428538/,Pathogenesis of asthma,"There is now strong evidence that airway inflammation is a predominant underlying problem in patients with asthma, and it has been suggested that ongoing inflammation may lead to airway injury and remodeling. There is also recent evidence that longstanding asthma could be associated with loss of elastic recoil, which can enhance airway obstruction and worsen asthma control [82,83]. Therefore, the use of anti-inflammatory therapy has been advocated in all guidelines, including the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Expert Panel Report [84] and its recent update [85] that recommended inhaled steroids as a first mode of therapy for patients with mild, moderate, or severe, persistent asthma. There is preliminary evidence that early institution of anti-inflammatory therapy might lead to disease modification and limit the progression of subepithelial fibrosis and airway remodeling. The pathogenesis of asthma clearly involves many cells and mediators, although the contribution of each individual factor is probably different from patient to patient depending on the setting and stimulus. Although currently available therapies are highly effective in controlling asthma symptoms and limiting exacerbations in the majority of patients, there is still a subset of patients that proceed to develop severe asthma with decreased lung function, lack of responsiveness to therapy, or frequent exacerbations. It is hoped that rapid progress in the area of asthma genetics and pharmacogenetics will yield a more precise and patient-specific understanding of asthma pathogenesis and allow practitioners to prescribe therapies that are designed for a particular patient or exacerbation. That will undoubtedly help to improve the care of asthma, limit its morbidity, and reduce the side effect of medications.",,Nizar N Jarjour;Elizabeth A B Kelly
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15849323/,Severe asthma in adults,"Severe asthma remains poorly understood and frustrating to care for, partly because it is a heterogeneous disease. Patients with severe asthma disproportionately consume health care resources related to asthma. Severe asthma may develop over time, or shortly after onset of the disease. The genetic and environmental elements that may be most important in the development of severe disease are poorly understood, but likely include both allergic and nonallergic elements. Physiologically, these patients often have air trapping, airway collapsibility, and a high degree of methacholine hyperresponsiveness. Specific phenotypes of severe asthma are only beginning to be defined. However, describing severe asthma by age at onset (early- vs. late-onset) appears to describe two phenotypes that differ at immunologic, physiologic, epidemiologic, and pathologic levels. In particular, early-onset severe asthma is a more allergic-associated disease than late-onset severe asthma. In addition, patients with severe asthma can be defined on the basis of presence and type of inflammation. Severe asthma with persistent eosinophilia (of either early or late onset) is more symptomatic and has more near-fatal events. However, at least 50% of patients with severe asthma have very little identifiable inflammation. Thus, ""steroid resistance"" may occur at numerous levels, not all of which are caused by a lack of effect of steroids on inflammation. Treatment remains problematic, with corticosteroids remaining the most effective therapy. However, 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, anti-IgE, and immunomodulatory drugs are also likely to have a place in treatment. Improving therapy in this disease will require a better understanding of the phenotypes involved.",,Sally Wenzel
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31145940/,Does understanding endotypes translate to better asthma management options for all?,"Despite the development of novel treatments, improvement in the design of delivery devices, and new technologies for monitoring and improving adherence, the burden of asthma is not decreasing. Predicting an individual patient's response to asthma drugs remains challenging, and the provision of personalized treatment remains elusive. Although biomarkers, such as allergic sensitization and blood eosinophilia, might be important predictors of response to inhaled corticosteroids in preschool children, these relatively cheap and available investigations are seldom used in clinical practice to select patients for corticosteroid prescription. However, for the majority of patients, response to different treatments cannot be accurately predicted. One of the key factors preventing further advances is the reductionist view of asthma as a single disease, which is forcing patients with different asthma subtypes into a single group for empiric treatment. This inevitably results in treatment failures and, for some, an unacceptable risk/benefit ratio. The approach to asthma today is an example of the traditional symptom (diagnosis)-based, one-size-fits-all approach rather than a stratified approach, and our guidelines-driven management based on a unitary diagnosis might not be the optimal way to deliver care. The only way to deliver stratified medicine and find a cure is through the understanding of asthma endotypes. We propose that the way to discover endotypes, biomarkers, and personalized treatments is through the iterative process based on interpretation of big data analytics from birth and patient cohorts, responses to treatments in randomized controlled trials, and in vitro mechanistic studies using human samples and experimental animal models, with technological and methodological advances at its core.",Asthma; childhood; cohorts; data driven; endotypes; integration; team science.,Adnan Custovic;John Henderson;Angela Simpson

It is important to recognize, however, that asthma severity involves both the severity of the underlying disease and its responsiveness to treatment. Thus, the first update of the GINA guidelines defined asthma severity depending on the clinical features already proposed as well as the current treatment of the patient. In addition, severity is not a fixed feature of asthma, but may change over months or years, whereas the classification by severity suggests a static feature. Moreover, using severity as an outcome measure has limited value in predicting what treatment will be required and what the response to that treatment might be. Because of these considerations, the classification of asthma severity is no longer recommended as the basis for treatment decisions, a periodic assessment of asthma control being more relevant and useful.",,M Humbert;S Holgate;L-P Boulet;J Bousquet

A significant challenge in the diagnosis and management of severe asthma is the ability to identify accurately the patients most at risk for adverse outcomes, such as medication side effects, emergency department visits, hospitalization, near-fatal events, or disability from persistent symptoms or chronic lung function abnormalities. To improve the treatment of these patients, we must improve our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for severe disease. To achieve this goal, it is imperative to develop a common definition of severe asthma to allow adequate characterization of the disease clinically and provide the opportunity to compare results from many studies. Several severe asthma phenotypes have been described in the literature on the basis of the age of patients, age of disease onset, corticosteroid resistance, chronic airflow obstruction, and evidence for eosinophilic airway inflammation on biopsy. These phenotypes have led to an emerging interest in the use of noninvasive methods to monitor airway inflammation in severe asthma.

Distinguishing phenotypes with regard to the severity or duration of the disease is essential. A phenotype covers the clinically relevant properties of the disease, but does not show the direct relationship to disease etiology and pathophysiology. Different pathogenetic mechanisms might cause similar asthma symptoms and might be operant in a certain phenotype. These putative mechanisms are addressed by the term 'endotype'. Classification of asthma based on endotypes provides advantages for epidemiological, genetic, and drug-related studies. A successful definition of endotypes should link key pathogenic mechanisms with the asthma phenotype. Thus, the identification of corresponding molecular biomarkers for individual pathogenic mechanism underlying phenotypes or subgroups within a phenotype is important.

While traditional views of asthma have centered around a childhood onset disease with an allergic component, several large scale network studies are now confirming that severe asthma can present in multiple different ways, only 30-50% of which meet traditional childhood onset allergic criteria. To understand the different groups better, initial studies have attempted to define phenotypes of severe asthma. A phenotype is defined as the integration of different characteristics that are the product of the interaction of the patient's genes with the environment. Both clinical and statistical approaches have identified at least 3-5 phenotypes of severe asthma. However, these phenotypes, in isolation, do not identify the immunopathology that makes these clinical phenotypes distinct or identifies a target population for a specific approach to therapy. As biological characteristics are identified, phenotypes should continue to evolve towards asthma endotypes. The identification of these endotypes, either by matching biology, genetics and therapeutic responses to therapy with clinically or statistically defined phenotypes or through unbiased genetic and genomic approaches, remains limited.

Its definition continues to be controversial because there is no single genetic or environmental cause. Addressed from a descriptive point of view, the disease components include airway inflammation, symptoms, variable airflow limitation and chronic airflow limitation. The essentialist definition conveys the message that asthma is a separate disease entity, fails to identify a primary defining characteristic which separates it from other diseases and is long winded. These disadvantages are overcome by the nominalist definition of asthma in which the word 'asthma'refers to an abnormality of airway function, specifically to wide variations in airflow limitation over short periods of time. In patients with asthma the other components of airway disease need to be considered. These have separate nominalist definitions and especially include different types of bronchitis for airway inflammation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for chronic airflow limitation. What is present will vary between and within patients. The accurate diagnosis of asthma and of other components of disease all require objective measurements.

Follow-up studies have shown that in many patients asthma cannot be verified despite ongoing symptoms. Mechanisms other than bronchial obstruction may therefore be responsible. The current definition of asthma may also include symptoms that are related to mechanisms other than bronchial obstruction, the clinical hallmark of asthma.",Diagnostics; epidemiology; exercise induced; management/control; mechanisms.,Olle Löwhagen

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10868701/,Reviewing asthma and anxiety,"The main characteristic of asthma is sudden and unexpected attacks of impaired breathing. Both the attacks themselves and the prospect of attacks generate much anxiety amongst patients. Several different forms of anxiety can be identified which vary in intensity and the situations in which they appear. Anxiety disorders are more common in asthmatics and have a considerable influence on asthma management because they influence symptom perception. Excessive anxiety about asthma symptoms can affect the patient's response to an asthma attack; anxiety related to asthma triggers can reduce the patient's quality of life and anxiety related to medical treatment can influence compliance. The extent of this influence depends upon an individual's ability to cope. Behavioural therapeutic programmes for patient education offer an opportunity to reduce anxiety and to improve asthma self-management. Physicians should look carefully for anxiety when taking the patient's history, and should support the patient's participation in asthma education programs.",,C ten Thoren;F Petermann
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22794682/,Chapter 9: Asthma classification,"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways resulting physiologically in hyperreactivity and clinically in recurrent episodes of wheezing, chest tightness, or coughing. Airway inflammation, smooth muscle contraction, epithelial sloughing, mucous hypersecretion, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and mucosal edema contribute to the underlying pathophysiology of asthma. Diagnostic tests such as methacholine or mannitol challenges or spirometry (pre- and postbronchodilator responses) help to identify such underlying pathophysiology via assessments of bronchial hyperreactivity and lung mechanics but are imperfect and ultimately must be viewed in the context of a patient's clinical presentation including response to pharmacotherapy. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report (2007) classifies asthma into either intermittent or persistent, and the latter is either mild, moderate, or severe. Some patients change in either direction from intermittent to persistent asthma. In addition, patients with asthma may be classified as allergic (IgE mediated), nonallergic (often triggered by viral upper respiratory tract infections or no apparent cause), occupational, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, potentially (near) fatal, exercise induced, and cough variant asthma. In the latter, the patients have a nonproductive cough that responds to treatment for asthma but not with antibiotics, expectorants, mucolytics, antitussives, beta(2)-adrenergic agonists, treatment for acid reflux, or rhinosinusitis. Thus, cough variant asthma is in the differential diagnosis of chronic cough.",,Alan P Koterba;Carol A Saltoun

Our understanding of asthma and its therapy has changed markedly over the last few years, particularly with the application of molecular and cell biology and the discovery of new and more specific pharmacological tools. 2. Many inflammatory cells participate in the inflammatory process in asthma and mediate a complex mixture of mediators. Cytokines are of particular importance as mediators of chronic inflammation and the means by which cytokines amplify and perpetuate the inflammatory process is now emerging. Airway epithelial cells may be a particularly important source of cytokines and other mediators, such as nitric oxide and endothelin, and may be a major target cell for inhaled steroids, which are the most effective therapy for asthma currently available. 3. The inflammatory process in asthma results not only in bronchoconstriction, but also plasma exudation, the activation of neural mechanisms, mucus secretion. The chronic inflammation may lead to structural changes, including an increase in airway smooth muscle and fibrosis, that are essentially irreversible. There is increasing evidence that transcription factors, such as NF-kappa B, play a pivotal role in the expression of inflammatory genes in asthma and may be the major molecular target for glucocorticoids.",,P J Barnes

Nonallergic asthma occurs in 10% to 33% of individuals with asthma and has a later onset than allergic asthma, with a female predominance. Nonallergic asthma appears to be more severe than allergic asthma in many cases and may be less responsive to standard therapy. Although many of the immunopathologic features of nonallergic asthma are similar to those observed with allergic asthma, some differences have been described, including a higher expression of RANTES in mucosa and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, as well as a higher GM-CSF receptor alpha expression.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18713656/,Asthma management and prevention: current perspectives,"The continuing evolution of asthma treatment and prevention are reflected in updated guidelines from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program and Global Initiative for Asthma as well as other recent publications. The 2007 Expert Panel Report 3 guidelines designate severity and control, mediated by considerations of current impairment and future risk, as the primary concepts in assessing and monitoring asthma. Severity should ideally be determined at the time of diagnosis, after which control becomes the central focus of asthma management. In the area of treatment, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) remain first-line therapy for longterm asthma management in children and adults. For patients whose severity of asthma requires more than low-dose ICSs, or whose asthma cannot be well controlled on monotherapy with low-dose ICSs, evidence supports the efficacy of combination therapy consisting of an ICS plus an inhaled long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) or an increase to medium-dose ICSs. For children >5 years of age and adults not controlled on low-dose ICSs, the combination of a low-dose ICS plus an inhaled LABA is equivalent in terms of outcomes to the use of medium-dose ICS. For children <5 years of age not controlled on low-dose ICSs, increasing the dose of ICSs is preferred to the addition of a LABA to low-dose ICS therapy as no studies using combination therapy have been conducted for patients in this age group. With regard to asthma prevention, approaches to primary prevention (to avoid allergen sensitization) and secondary prevention (to avoid disease progression) are still very much in the developmental stage, while tertiary prevention (to avoid asthmatic stimuli) has been more successful particularly in pediatric patients. Written action plans as part of self-management processes appear to improve physician-patient communication and disease status tracking.

Critical pieces of evidence for this concept include the fact that ET-1 is an extremely potent spasmogen in human and animal airway smooth muscle and that it is synthesised in and released from the bronchial epithelium. Importantly, symptomatic asthma involves a marked enhancement of these processes, whereas asthmatics treated with anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids exhibit reductions in these previously elevated indices.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16105156/,Difficult asthma in adults: recognition and approaches to management,"Difficult asthma must be distinguished from severe asthma. It is then important in patients with suspected difficult asthma to ensure that the diagnosis is correct, and that if the patient has asthma that the attributed symptoms are indeed all genuinely due to the asthma and not to coexisting physical or psychogenic respiratory conditions. It is also important to be alert when there is discordance between symptoms and objective lung function in order to recognize both poor perceivers and over-reactors. Difficult asthma can occur in patients with objectively mild, moderate or severe disease, but the consequences are most dramatic in patients with severe asthma. Asthma may be difficult for the patient, for the clinician or both because of disease factors, doctor or nurse therapist factors, and/or patient factors. Investigation requires access to the full range of respiratory, imaging and allergy tests. It also requires a multidisciplinary approach involving ear, nose and throat specialists and speech therapists, and access to psychiatric and psychological assessment and therapies. Poor compliance is associated with significantly poorer asthma and asthma-related health outcomes. Poor compliance can be recognized in two-thirds of such patients by their not attending scheduled appointments. Poor compliance is significantly associated with anxiety, social deprivation and adverse family circumstances, and these characteristics and adversities probably contribute to the poorly compliant behaviour. In difficult asthma it is important to identify and manage the condition causing the symptoms rather than prescribing more and more asthma therapy. Recognizing psychosocial adversity is essential. A structured approach is essential. There remains a small number of patients with genuine steroid-resistant asthma, some with predominately neutrophilic rather than eosinophilic airway inflammation, and others for whom the secondary gain of continuing symptoms is overwhelming. There is a need for further research using agreed definitions, structured approaches and a full range of investigations in patients with difficult asthma.",,B D W Harrison

Vitamin D (VD) not only regulates the expression of genes associated with calcium homeostasis, but also the genes associated with cancers, autoimmune diseases, and infection. VD has also non-genomic activities e.g. it is a potentially safe and effective novel strategy for decreasing the asthma episodes and controlling exacerbations. Our review assessed the dose, serum level, duration of administration and outcomes of VD in cases of asthmas. Although a body of research evidences the effectiveness of VD supplementation in asthma, other studies showed the insignificant response of VD to asthma either with low dose or low achieved serum VD levels. Nevertheless, recent reviews suggest that manipulating VD status holds promise for primary prevention and treatment of asthma. Future research on the relationship between VD and asthma should consider utilizing adequate doses of VD preparations for sufficient duration (likely to be >12 months) aiming to achieve appropriate level of serum VD (25-hydroxyvitamin D) concentration (likely to be at least >40 ng/mL).",Asthma; hormones; men’s health; testosterone; vitamin D.,Onder Canguven;Welid El Ansari;Aksam Yassin
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7944080/,NIH conference. Asthma,"Asthma is characterized by inflammation, reversible airway obstruction, and increased airway responsiveness to various stimuli. It has received wide public attention in recent years because of increasing morbidity and deaths, particularly among black persons. The important role of inflammation in the immunopathogenesis of asthma has led to a newer therapeutic approach directed at interrupting this inflammatory process. Among immune regulatory pathways involved in asthma pathogenesis, two lymphokines appear to be particularly important in controlling IgE production. Interleukin-4 is required for IgE production; without it, IgE production is inhibited. Interferon-gamma can diminish cell priming for interleukin-4 production. Thus, the interplay of these two cytokines will determine whether cells that can make interleukin-4 will be produced and, therefore, whether IgE will be produced in response to allergic stimuli. Further, in response to appropriate stimuli, mast cells and eosinophils are attracted to airways and release cytokines, lipid mediators, and preformed substances that cause inflammation. Modern asthma treatment is directed at interrupting this inflammatory process and places a much greater emphasis on use of anti-inflammatory agents, such as aerosolized or parenteral corticosteroids, and on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as cromolyn sodium and nedocromil sodium. Research advances without therapeutic application, however, limit success. Projects such as the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' National Cooperative Inner-City Asthma Study, which is directed toward underserved populations, are intended to identify more clearly the factors responsible for increasing morbidity and to develop appropriate therapeutic interventions.",,R A Goldstein;W E Paul;D D Metcalfe;W W Busse;E R Reece
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18241692/,10. Occupational asthma,"A diversity of airborne dusts, gases, fumes, and vapors can induce dose-related respiratory symptoms in individuals exposed in the workplace. These agents can cause annoyance reactions, irritational effects, sensitization, or the induction of corrosive changes in the respiratory tract, depending on their composition, concentration, and duration of exposure. The prevalence of occupational asthma (OA) ranges from 9% to 15% of the asthmatic population. Factors that might influence the development of OA include the work environment, climatic conditions, genetic proclivities, tobacco and recreational drug use, respiratory infection, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and endotoxin exposure. Pathogenetically, new-onset OA can be allergic or nonallergic in origin. The allergic variants are usually caused by high-molecular-weight allergens, such as grain dust and animal or fish protein. Selected low-molecular-weight agents are also capable of inducing allergic OA. Symptoms ensue after a latent period of months to years. Nonallergic OA can be precipitated by a brief high-level exposure to a potent irritant. Symptoms occur immediately or within a few hours of the exposure. Once the diagnosis of allergic OA is established, the worker should be removed from further exposure in the workplace. In nonallergic OA the worker can return to work if the exposure was clearly a nonrecurring event. If the diagnosis is made in a timely fashion, most workers experience improvement.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2032134/,Can asthma be cured?,"1. There is much evidence that many asthmatics lose their symptoms for long periods and are in this sense 'cured'. 2. The factors leading to restitution of normally reactive healthy airways are multiple and only partially understood. 3. Attempts at cure are likely to require a multi-faceted approach where inducers and sensitizers of asthma are reduced as far as possible at the same time as stimulating biological factors whose function is to preserve normal patho-physiology of the airways. 4. Identification of these controlling factors requires intensive study using naturally occurring models of individuals who have and have not gone into remission. 5. Whether anti-asthma medication will help usefully in redressing the balance or whether by inhibiting the stimulus for the production of inherent biological controlling factors, they actually mitigate against persisting remission (i.e. 'cure') needs urgent study. Such a possibility might account for some of the remarkable inconsistencies in epidemiological studies currently being reported. In particular, while medications for the control of asthma have improved dramatically over the last twenty years, the prevalence and perhaps mortality rates from asthma are actually rising.

Asthma, however, is emerging as a heterogeneous disease, and these features need to be considered in both the diagnosis and management of this disease in individual patients. These diverse or phenotypic features add complexity to the diagnosis of asthma, as well as attempts to achieve control with treatment. Although the diagnosis of asthma is often based on clinical information, it is important to pursue objective criteria as well, including an evaluation for reversibility of airflow obstruction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, an area with new diagnostic approaches. Furthermore, there exist a number of treatment gaps (ie, exacerbations, step-down care, use of antibiotics, and severe disease) in which new direction is needed to improve care.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26420366/,Phenotyping and Endotyping Asthma Based on Biomarkers,"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airways disorder mainly characterized by heterogeneity. A phenotype is defined as a group of patients that present similar clinically observable characteristics, without establishing a direct etiologic relationship with a distinct pathophysiologic mechanism. An endotype, on the other hand, describes a subgroup that shares the same pathophysiologic processes that lead to the development, the progression and the presentation of a disease. A biomarker has been defined as a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention. Several inflammatory phenotypes have been identified by the use of biomarkers. Most of them are based on the predominant type of cells in different biological fluids with sputum to be remained the most representative one. Eosinophilia represents the major characteristic of what we called classic atopic asthma. This particular phenotype usually responds well to corticosteroids, except for a small subgroup of severe asthma where even in the presence of eosinophils the ICS seem to have a less responsive role. Neutrophilic phenotype driven by the presence of neutrophils shows inadequate response to corticosteroid treatment, even in mild asthma. The major approach in order to define an endotype is driven by three main parameters. The statistical clustering approach, use of advanced statistical mathematics to create distinct patient clusters, the specific targeted immune therapies and finally the application of omics' approach. Both phenotypes and endotypes are trying to clarify mechanisms and processes that driven the complexity of asthma.

We will discuss the challenges of considering GEIs and the advantages of studying responses to asthma-associated exposures in clinical birth cohorts, as well as in cell models of GEIs, to dissect the context-specific nature of genotypic risks, to prioritize variants in genome-wide association studies, and to identify pathways involved in pathogenesis in subgroups of patients.

Asthma is managed in steps according to disease symptoms and severity. Treatment goals are to decrease symptoms, improve pulmonary function, and reduce overall morbidity and the associated cost of medical care. Antiasthma drugs are a key component of asthma management that are classified as either long-term-control medications that control symptoms and prevent disease exacerbations, or quick-relief medications that rapidly relieve airway obstruction and acute asthma symptoms. Several new leukotriene (LT) modulators have been developed that promise to improve asthma control, including LT receptor antagonists montelukast and zafirlukast and the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton. Each decreases symptoms and the use of rescue medication, and improves pulmonary function in patients with mild intermittent to moderate persistent asthma.",,J P Kemp
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16950268/,The natural history of asthma,"Asthma begins most often in infants as wheezing with respiratory infections. If these episodes are mild and infrequent, asthma does not usually persist into the school years. However, if they are more frequent and severe, the asthma is likely to persist. After infancy, incidence falls and continues at about 100/100,000 for the rest of the lifespan. Allergic asthma develops most often in the second decade of life and frequently persists into adult years, but young patients with allergic asthma often enjoy a transient or even a permanent remission. More severe disease and continued allergen exposure cause persistence. Some patients with occupational asthma continue to have asthma long after exposure ceases. Asthma beginning after the fourth decade is usually intrinsic and may include the aspirin triad. Its severity tends to increase with time. Many middle-aged and elderly adults have a persistent decline in lung function that is retarded but not completely prevented by aerosol glucocorticoids. This loss of lung function is often the result of coexisting lung diseases, particularly bronchiectasis and COPD. Patients with asthma have the same overall rate and age of death as the general population, but are more likely to die of lung diseases, including cancer.",,Charles E Reed

It is estimated, however, that 5% to 10% of patients with asthma have severe disease that is unresponsive to typical therapeutics, including corticosteroids. Because patients with severe asthma are disproportionately affected by their disease, in terms of both impaired lifestyle and health care costs, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute sponsored a workshop on the pathogenesis of severe asthma. The goals of this workshop were to begin to define the characteristics of severe asthma. In these discussions, it was clear that many characteristics need to be considered in defining this phenotype of asthma, including symptoms, intensity of therapy (including administration of systemic corticosteroids), and impairment of lung function. Also discussed were potential mechanisms of severe asthma including the role of allergic diseases, which may play less of a role in severe asthma than in mild-to-moderate disease, and infections. A major limitation to control of severe asthma is the recalcitrant response of these patients to usual therapy including systemic corticosteroids; the potential of other therapies was reviewed. From these discussions, recommendations were made for future research needs to gain insights into a difficult therapeutic and possibly novel mechanistic area of asthma.",,W W Busse;S Banks-Schlegel;S E Wenzel

Practical points for diagnosis and management,"Asthma is a common chronic illness characterized by episodes of reversible airflow obstruction. A cornerstone of asthma management is identifying and avoiding agents that cause bronchospasm. The workplace is an important potential source of respirable exposures that can cause or trigger asthma. Identification of an occupational factor in asthma is important: early diagnosis and removal of the worker from the exposure is associated with improved prognosis; the diagnosis of occupational asthma may lead to compensation for work-related impairment and disability; and the diagnosis of occupational asthma is a Sentinel Health Event with implications for public health and prevention. In this article, we review specific causes of occupational asthma and general settings in which an occupational factor should be suspected and explored as part of the management of the worker with asthma. We also review specific and simple elements of history and pulmonary function testing that can be easily assessed by most health care practitioners and may be sufficient to establish a diagnosis of occupational asthma.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18841342/,[Asthma in children - is it different?],"Asthma is the most commonly observed chronic disease in childhood and the incidence has been increasing in industrialized countries over the last decades. Airway obstruction due to increased sensitivity of the small airways, mucus production and chronic inflammation are key features in the pathophysiology of asthma. Environmental and genetic factors predispose for the disease, which is clinically characterized by sudden occurrence of episodes of expiratory airway obstruction (wheezing). In the majority of preschool infants such obstructive episodes are triggered by viral infections (especially during the winter season) and do not necessarily predispose for asthma later in adulthood. Patient and family history (e.g. atopy), good clinical examination and differential diagnosis (e.g. exclusion of cystic fibrosis) are of prime importance as the role of lung function measurements is limited as the disease frequently occurs before the age of 5 years. Information about asthma is important for children, parents and caregivers.

The concepts of ""asthma control"" and""asthma severity"" are currently evolving, although the fundamental hall-marks that define the syndrome of asthma endure and should be mastered by asthma specialists. Asthma masqueraders, including several that may confound a correct diagnosis of asthma, are important to consider when either the presentation of asthma is atypical or the response of the patient to treatment is suboptimal. COPD and VCD head the list of diagnoses most likely to be confused with asthma in everyday practice. Correctly identifying the diagnosis of COPD enables implementation of an up-to-date treatment plan that differs from asthma management. VCD is a vastly under recognized syndrome whose existence is widely accepted but whose pathophysiology is poorly understood, and correctly identifying a VCD component to asthma symptoms enables both a reduction in costly and potentially harmful asthma medications and focus on specific VCD treatment, such as speech therapy. For less common and uncommon asthma masqueraders, it is important to be familiar with their typical clinical presentation and basic diagnostic approaches.",,Stephen A Tilles

Two treatment modalities are indicated only for individuals with allergic asthma: allergen-specific immunotherapy, commonly known as allergy shots, and omalizumab. Allergen immunotherapy is effective in decreasing symptoms and medication use in selected patients with mild-to-moderate allergic asthma. In addition, patients receiving allergen immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis may have a decreased risk of developing asthma. Omalizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibody indicated for persistent moderate-to-severe allergic asthma, has been shown to improve asthma-related quality of life, decrease clinically significant exacerbation rates, number of courses of oral corticosteroids, and reduce the severity of exacerbations.

Blood samples from case-control studies (study 1: 348 asthmas and 39 normal controls and validation study 2: 411 asthmas and 87 normal controls) were enrolled. The single-sample gene set enrichment analysis method was performed to quantify the abundance of 21 TLR signatures. Gene ontology analysis and pathway function analysis were conducted for functional analysis, and a protein-protein interaction network was constructed. The area under the curve (AUC) value was used to assess the diagnostic capacity. In this study, TLR2/TLR3/TLR4 pathway, MyD88-dependent/independent TLR pathway, positive regulation of TLR4 pathway, and TLR binding signatures were significantly higher in asthma. Functional analysis showed that biological processes and pathways were still involved in TLR cascades and TLR signaling pathway. Eleven hub TLR-related genes were identified, and further validation demonstrated that the combination of TLR-related genes was a good diagnostic biomarker for asthma (AUC = 0.8). Our study provided more insight into the underlying immune mechanism of how TLR signatures affected asthma.

Recurrent asthma exacerbations cause a decline in lung function and, in childhood, are linked to development of persistent asthma. This position paper, from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, highlights the shortcomings of current treatment guidelines for patients suffering from frequent asthma exacerbations and those with difficult-to-treat asthma and severe treatment-resistant asthma. It reviews current evidence that supports a call for increased awareness of (i) the seriousness of asthma exacerbations and (ii) the need for novel treatment strategies in specific forms of severe treatment-resistant asthma. There is strong evidence linking asthma exacerbations with viral airway infection and underlying deficiencies in innate immunity and evidence of a synergism between viral infection and allergic mechanisms in increasing risk of exacerbations. Nonadherence to prescribed medication has been identified as a common clinical problem amongst adults and children with difficult-to-control asthma. Appropriate diagnosis, assessment of adherence and other potentially modifiable factors (such as passive or active smoking, ongoing allergen exposure, psychosocial factors) have to be a priority in clinical assessment of all patients with difficult-to-control asthma.

Many people perceive diet as being an important precipitant of their asthma but objective testing suggests that it is only important in a minority.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15249897/,[Childhood asthma],"The concept of chronicity in asthma, as emphasized by recent definitions of the disease, rests on the major characteristics of inflammatory response of the airways and progressive development of irreversible structural and functional alterations, or so-called airway remodeling. In childhood, however, such characteristics as chronicity and irreversibility are debatable. Various clinical phenotypes with variable degrees of severity of persistence are found in children. Furthermore, many patients with a history of recurrent wheezing in early infancy do not develop asthma later in life. The prevalence of asthma, especially in its mild forms, has increased markedly in recent years. Although the trend has stabilized in Italy, it continues to rise in other Western countries. Our research has shown that increased cutaneous response to histamine determines a major prevalence of positive skin tests. The rise in clinical forms of the disease accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms is partly attributable to the dietary intake of food and beverages processed from environmentally engineered products. The features of the new forms of asthma demand accurate clinical and functional assessment. In addition to pulmonary function tests, determinations for eosinophils and inflammation markers in the blood and sputum, noninvasive methods have recently become available to assess airway inflammation. Among these, particularly useful studies include test for nitric oxide in exhaled air, along with tests for other markers of allergic inflammation and oxidative stress in the droplets of the exhaled air. Because in paediatric age, prolonged use of inhaled steroids increase the risk of growth impairment, asthma therapy should be guided by clinical criteria and examinations, rather than by rigid treatment guidelines. Moreover, to secure successful treatment, the parents and the child as well should be involved in monitoring the course of the disease.",,R Ronchetti;M P Villa;M Barreto

The clustering of symptoms of dyspnoea, chest tightness, wheeze, and their intermittent nature usually leads to a diagnosis of asthma. Nevertheless physicians should be aware of some atypical presentations such as recurrent infections, wheezing bronchitis, exercise induced dyspnoea or chronic cough. Physicians have also to recognize early symptoms of an acute severe asthma. For the identification of the allergen(s) responsible for asthma, data obtained from clinical history, from cutaneous prick tests eventually associated to serum specific IgE antibodies have to be taken in account. The assessment of severity of asthma is another essential point: it needs to be documented by using pulmonary function tests and in more severe forms of asthma on regular measurements of peak expiratory flow rate.",,I Tillie-Leblond;A B Tonnel

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12045411/,The diagnosis and management of asthma is much tougher in older patients,"Half the elderly individuals with asthma have not been diagnosed, yet their quality of life is substantially impaired. Primary care physicians should, therefore, be encouraged to ask about respiratory symptoms in elderly patients, and then perform office spirometry for those with symptoms. Airway obstruction increases the likelihood of asthma, but the lack of a 'significant' acute bronchodilator response is clinically meaningless. Methacholine challenge testing is safe and useful for detecting asthma in patients with normal baseline spirometry. Only one in five life-long smokers ever develops chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, so elderly smokers should also be evaluated for reversible airways obstruction. A normal diffusing capacity test will rule out emphysema in current and former smokers. Elderly individuals whose asthma has been diagnosed are often receiving sub-optimal treatment, resulting in poor asthma control and a high death rate. Co-morbidities (recognized or not) are the rule in elderly patients, and these conditions, or the drugs taken to treat them, may exacerbate asthma. Conversely, bronchodilators and corticosteroids used to treat asthma often worsen co-morbid conditions, such as osteoporosis, ocular disease, and cardiac arrhythmias. Therefore, extra caution is needed when treating elderly asthmatic patients, and objective monitoring of their response to each new asthma medication is important.",,Paul L Enright

Initial wheezing episodes in young children often are linked to respiratory infections due to viral pathogens, such as respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, and influenza virus. Bacterial colonization of the neonatal airway also may be significant in the late development of recurrent wheeze and asthma. Wheezing in young children can be classified into specific phenotypes based on the onset and persistence of wheezing. Although some children will only wheeze transiently in early childhood, persistent wheezing is often classified as immunoglobulin E (IgE) associated and/or atopic or nonatopic. By using a modified asthma predictive index, future development of asthma can be interpreted, especially in high-risk populations. It is recommended to follow National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines for initiation of treatment; however, asthma management of young children often requires tailored regimens. Inhaled corticosteroids used as a daily controller medication have been shown to aid symptoms and exacerbation control; however, these do not change the natural course of the disease or progression to asthma. Although randomized double-blind studies in preschoolers investigated a role of macrolide antibiotics in early infection as well as high-dose inhaled corticosteroids during severe lower respiratory tract infections, more research is needed in this field to understand mechanisms of asthma development and optimal treatment in this young age group.",,Nurcicek Padem;Rachel Glick Robison

TLRs are localized as integral membrane or intracellular glycoproteins with those on the cell surface sensing microbial antigens and the ones, localized in intracellular vesicles, sensing microbial nucleic acid species. Having recognized microbial antigens, TLRs conduct the immune response towards a pro- or anti-allergy response. As a double-edged sword, they could initiate either harmful or helpful responses by the immune system in case of allergic asthma.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20851050/,Influence of indoor factors in dwellings on the development of childhood asthma,"Asthma has become the most common, childhood chronic disease in the industrialized world, and it is also increasing in developing regions. There are huge differences in the prevalence of childhood asthma across countries and continents, and there is no doubt that the prevalence of asthma was strongly increasing during the past decades worldwide. Asthma, as a complex disease, has a broad spectrum of potential determinants ranging from genetics to life style and environmental factors. Environmental factors are likely to be important in explaining the regional differences and the overall increasing trend towards asthma's prevalence. Among the environmental conditions, indoor factors are of particular interest because people spend more than 80% of their time indoors globally. Increasing prices for oil, gas and other sources of primary energy will further lead to better insulation of homes, and ultimately to reduced energy costs. This will decrease air exchange rates and will lower the dilution of indoor air mass with ambient air. Indoor air quality and potential health effects will therefore be an area for future research and for gaining a better understanding of asthma epidemics. This strategic review will summarize the current knowledge of the effects of a broad spectrum of indoor factors on the development of asthma in childhood in Western countries based on epidemiological studies. In conclusion, several epidemiological studies point out, that indoor factors might cause asthma in childhood. Stronger and more consistent findings are seen when exposure to these indoor factors is assessed by surrogates for the source of the actual toxicants. Measurement-based exposure assessments for several indoor factors are less common than using surrogates of the exposure. These studies, however, mainly showed heterogeneous results. The most consistent finding for an induction of asthma in childhood is related to exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, to living in homes close to busy roads, and in damp homes where are visible moulds at home. The causing agents of the increased risk of living in damp homes remained uncertain and needs clarification. Exposure to pet-derived allergens and house dust mites are very commonly investigated and thought to be related to asthma onset. The epidemiological evidence is not sufficient to recommend avoidance measures against pet and dust mites as preventive activities against allergies. More research is also needed to clarify the potential risk for exposure to volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds due to renovation activities, phthalates and chlorine chemicals due to cleaning.",,Joachim Heinrich

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11393503/,A guide to the diagnosis and treatment of occupational asthma,"Occupational asthma is the most prevalent form of occupational lung disease in industrialized nations. As increasing numbers of new chemicals are produced and new manufacturing processes are introduced, the variety of environments in which individuals may become exposed to respiratory sensitizers and irritants makes diagnosing and treating this illness even more challenging. In addition to adverse pulmonary effects, the diagnosis of occupational asthma may bring with it negative social and financial implications that may ultimately affect the patient's quality of life. For this reason, it is important for clinicians to recognize work-related respiratory symptoms early on in their course, maintain a high clinical suspicion for an occupational cause in the diagnostic work-up of asthma, and have a high degree of certainty in the diagnosis. While a number of classification schemes have been proposed to simplify the diagnostic approach to occupational asthma, the inciting factors typically involve sensitization (often by an IgE mechanism), direct airway inflammation, various pharmacologic responses, or irritant reflex pathways. Clinicians must first document the presence of asthma, then establish a relationship between asthma and the work-place. The occupational history is the key diagnostic tool, and clinical suspicions may be evaluated further by serial peak expiratory flow measurements, nonspecific hypersensitivity challenges with histamine or methacholine, collaboration with industrial/occupational hygienists to obtain workplace exposure measurements, and specific challenge testing at tertiary referral centers providing specialized laboratories. Removal from the inciting exposure is the mainstay of therapy, and pharmacologic treatment of patients with occupational asthma is similar to the treatment of patients with other forms of asthma.",,J T Rabatin;C T Cowl

Morbidity rates show large variations, which can be attributed to differences in defining the disease, but also to genuine variations, with a trend towards less asthma in northern Europe. It has been suggested that allergic diseases as a whole, and asthma in particular, may exhibit an upward secular trend. Risk factors include a genetic background and environmental triggering factors. The importance of genetic factors is illustrated by family studies and by extreme prevalence rates observed in some communities. Environmental factors include rapid air pollution variations which act as a trigger for asthma attacks. However, at levels currently prevailing in western Europe, air pollutants do not induce a higher incidence of asthma. Altitude generates a gradual decrease in Dermatophagoides, thus explaining both the clinical improvement in asthmatics living in altitude and a lower prevalence of asthma in populations born and living there. Among the other aero-allergens, grass pollens plays a major role in spring, elicitating asthma attacks.

This heterogeneity complicates characterization of each disease and, in some cases, hinders the selection of appropriate treatment. Therefore, in recent years, emphasis has been placed on improving our understanding of the various phenotypes of asthma and of COPD and identifying biomarkers for each phenotype. Likewise, the concept of the endotype has been gaining acceptance; an endotype is a disease subtype that is defined by unique or distinctive functional or pathophysiological mechanisms. Endotypes of asthma or COPD may be primarily characterized by increased susceptibility to type 2 inflammation, increased susceptibility to viral infections, bacterial colonization or impaired lung development. The 'Dutch hypothesis' is as follows: gene variants underlying particular endotypes interact with detrimental environmental stimuli (e.g. smoking, viral infection and air pollution) and contribute to the ultimate development of asthma, COPD or both. Novel approaches that involve multidimensional assessment should facilitate identification and management of the components that generate this heterogeneity. Ultimately, patients with chronic inflammatory lung diseases may be treated based on these endotypes as determined by the respective biomarkers that correspond to individual endotypes instead of on disease labels such as asthma, COPD or even asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS).",,N Hizawa

Misdiagnosis or insufficient treatment of asthma may risk the development of irreversible histological lesions and also could compromise pulmonary growth and the child's lung reserve.

The value of early diagnosis is to institute appropriate treatment notably in severe asthma with inhaled corticosteroid therapy, the aim being to reduce remodelling lesions of the airways. The minimal effective dose should be defined to minimalise side-effects. The treatment of asthma is not restricted to pharmacotherapy: attempts should be made to reduce intercurrent viral infections, domestic pollution (including smoking) and allergenic concentrations.

Variability in asthma symptoms may be a response to the individual's environment (e.g. seasonal variation, cigarette smoke, and air pollutants) or personal factors (e.g. inhaler technique, pregnancy, exercise). Co-morbid diseases such as allergic rhinitis may also impact significantly on asthma variability and control. Documenting asthma variability and assessing both adherence and possible triggers over time may allow patients and physicians to develop treatment programmes that anticipate, rather than follow, changes in the level of asthma symptoms.

Guidelines are an increasingly familiar part of clinical practice and may have potential benefits and harms. The potential harms of guidelines can be minimized if they are rigorously developed using evidence-based medicine. Guidelines should identify key decisions and their consequences and should review the consequences of alternative decisions. In addition, guidelines should be simple, user-friendly and widely disseminated. Guidelines evolve over time and their recommendations should be supported by evidence from clinical trials. Evidence-based medicine is the new paradigm but the results and reaction to the recent meta-analysis on house-dust mite control measures highlights the need for care when incorporating such information into guidelines. Newer therapeutic agents such as the leukotriene receptor antagonists are included in the most recent revision of the GINA guidelines, but their position in asthma therapy is not yet fully established.

The nomenclature regarding this group is confusing, and studies are difficult to compare due to the proliferation of terms describing poorly defined clinical entities. In this review of severe asthma in children, the term problematic severe asthma is used to describe children with any combination of chronic symptoms, acute severe exacerbations and persistent airflow limitation despite the prescription of multiple therapies. The approach to problematic severe asthma may vary with the age of the child, but, in general, three steps need to be taken in order to separate difficult-to-treat from severe therapy-resistant asthma. First, confirmation that the problem is really due to asthma requires a complete diagnostic re-evaluation.

This position paper reviews the literature linking exposure to cleaning products and the risk of asthma and focuses on prevention. Increased risk of asthma has been shown in many epidemiological and surveillance studies, and several case reports describe the relationship between exposure to one or more cleaning agents and WRA. Cleaning sprays, bleach, ammonia, disinfectants, mixing products, and specific job tasks have been identified as specific causes and/or triggers of asthma. Because research conclusions and policy suggestions have remained unheeded by manufactures, vendors, and commercial cleaning companies, it is time for a multifaceted intervention. Possible preventive measures encompass the following: substitution of cleaning sprays, bleach, and ammonia; minimizing the use of disinfectants; avoidance of mixing products; use of respiratory protective devices; and worker education. Moreover, we suggest the education of unions, consumer, and public interest groups to encourage safer products. In addition, information activities for the general population with the purpose of improving the knowledge of professional and domestic cleaners regarding risks and available preventive measures and to promote strict collaboration between scientific communities and safety and health agencies are urgently needed.",allergies; asthma; epidemiology; occupational; prevention.,A Siracusa;F De Blay;I Folletti;G Moscato;M Olivieri;S Quirce;M Raulf-Heimsoth;J Sastre;S M Tarlo;J Walusiak-Skorupa;J-P Zock

It necessitates rigorous clinical procedures to identify the aggravating factors. Allergic factors probably play an important role but are often ignored; atopy is more often associated with mild or moderate asthma. The prevalence of severe refractory asthma is not known with any precision, in view of the lack of a consensus definition. Few studies have examined the role of allergic factors. From a pathophysiologic perspective, genetic factors are probably responsible for greater severity, and allergic response plays an important role in some severe asthma phenotypes. From an environmental perspective, some airborne allergens are associated with the refractory character of the disease. Molds such as Alternaria are, for example, implicated in the onset of asthma attacks, as are some occupational exposure. Better knowledge of the pathophysiology of refractory asthma and its allergic dimensions have made it possible to use new treatment agents, such as omalizumab.

The relationship between cigarette smoking and airway inflammation is also well described, but relatively little data are available on the potential influence of smoking on asthmatic airway inflammation and its treatment. While cigarette smoking is common in people with asthma, with prevalence rates similar to the general population, studies in asthma have tended to concentrate on individuals who have never smoked. However, there is recent evidence that smoking may confer a degree of corticosteroid resistance in asthma, and this review examines the relationship between asthma and cigarette smoking, with particular reference to the impact of smoking on the response to treatment of asthma. Smoking has a number of known influences on drug activity and metabolism, but the mechanism underlying corticosteroid resistance in asthmatic smokers is not yet clear, although there are differences in the nature of the airway inflammation in individuals with asthma who smoke compared with nonsmoking asthmatic patients. Encouragingly, there is some evidence that smoking cessation may at least partially restore corticosteroid responsiveness in asthmatic ex-smokers. Smoking cessation measures must be given a high priority in individuals with asthma who smoke.",,Eric Livingston;Neil C Thomson;George W Chalmers

Use of a biomarker as a surrogate outcome in practice is most appropriate in settings in which the effects of therapy on clinical disease, as experienced by patients, are fully captured by that biomarker. Recent studies suggest that although asthma therapies can alter various biomarkers, the relationship between these biomarker changes and important clinical outcomes is inconsistent.

Asthma is a chronic airway inflammatory disease characterized by the infiltration of airway T cells, CD(+) (T helper) cells, mast cells, basophils, macrophages, and eosinophils. The cysteinyl leukotrienes also are important mediators in asthma and modulators of cytokine function, and they have been implicated in the pathophysiology of asthma through multiple mechanisms. Although the role of eosinophils in asthma and their contribution to bronchial hyperresponsiveness are still debated, it is widely accepted that their numbers and activation status are increased. Eosinophils may be targets for various pharmacologic activities of leukotriene receptor antagonists through their ability to downregulate a number of events that may be key to the effector function of these cells.",,Qutayba Hamid;Meri K Tulic';Mark C Liu;Redwan Moqbel

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current state of knowledge in relation to management of asthma in the elderly - focusing on barriers to diagnosis and treatment and the central role of self-management. Asthma prevalence increases with age, as does the risk of dying from asthma, and with the ageing of the population and increasing life expectancy, the prevalence of (diagnosed and undiagnosed) asthma in older adults is expected to increase drastically, placing an increasing burden on sufferers, the community and health budgets. Asthma sufferers are more likely to be psychologically distressed and at a higher risk of anxiety and depression, more likely to experience a sense of lack of control over their health and to have lower self-reported quality of life. Asthma is under-diagnosed, and under-treated, in the elderly, further exacerbating these negative consequences. The review concludes, among other things, that there is a need to better understand the development and impact of asthma in the elderly, to increase community awareness of asthma in the elderly, to improve both 'medical management' and 'self-management' in this population and to develop more effective tools for diagnosis and treatment of asthma in the elderly.

First, histological studies using fibreoptic bronchoscopy have led to the recognition that asthma is an inflammatory condition of the bronchial mucosa and is not simply caused by smooth muscle spasm. Secondly, there has been some disenchantment with the long term use of regular beta 2-adrenergic agonists as these agents do not appear to control bronchial inflammation and have been associated with deaths from asthma. Thirdly, there has been a general shift away from physician-centred management towards patient-oriented management plans. These three separate strands have led to the development of regional and international consensus documents that emphasise the use of regular anti-inflammatory treatment to control bronchial inflammation and reduce symptoms. With the emphasis on finding the minimum amount of treatment, several traditional anti-asthma medications have been downgraded in importance.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15725046/,Asthma management issues in infancy and childhood,"The prevalence of asthma has been increasing worldwide over the past 2 decades, especially the prevalence of childhood asthma. Currently, the prevalence of childhood asthma is around 3-20% in different countries based on the report from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children (ISAAC). Asthma in childhood is predominantly an extrinsic asthma. In general, countries in the coastal, temperate, and subtropical zones have the highest prevalence of mite- and cockroach-sensitive asthma. Countries in the sub-arctic or semi-arid areas have a lower prevalence of childhood asthma, mostly associated with sensitization to pet dander, moulds, and pollens. Many genes have been linked to asthma in different ethnic populations. A global consensus for the management of asthma in adults and children >5 years of age has been made possible in the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, where a step-wise management program using inhaled medication with and without oral anti-inflammatory drugs is recommended. The management of asthma in children <5 years of age remains inconclusive. Recent studies suggest that inherited susceptibility associated with risk factors from the prenatal and postnatal environment is likely to promote allergic sensitization and development of asthma. Consequently, early prevention of prenatal sensitization in utero and environmental control of early life exposure to various allergens may decrease the incidence of childhood asthma. In the management of moderate persistent asthma in infants and young children <5 years of age, airway resistance tests (FEV(1) or PEF) are not of significance, but assessment of respiratory rate and skin pulse oximeter measurements of arterial oxygen saturation are helpful. Moreover, recent advances in pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics may provide better individualized care for early pharmacological prevention of childhood asthma via selective modulation of airway remodeling.",,Kuender D Yang

Outpatient therapy for acute asthma, as well as therapy for status asthmaticus (episodes of asthma unresponsive to usually effective outpatient therapy and necessitating hospitalization), primarily addresses treatment of airway inflammation. The goal of office and emergency room management of acute asthma is reversal of airway obstruction by the administration of inhaled beta-adrenergic medications. The therapy for status asthmaticus consists of intravenously administered aminophylline, corticosteroids, nebulized beta-adrenergic agents, and oxygen. Respiratory failure, the inability to maintain adequate elimination of CO2, may be effectively treated by adding continuous nebulization of albuterol.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8714422/,Asthma: an important disease to otolaryngologists--Part I: Suspecting and diagnosing asthma,"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the lower respiratory tract which is triggered by exposure to allergens or other airway irritants. This inflammation results in airway hyperresponsiveness, bronchial muscle spasm, mucous gland hypersecretion and mucosal edema, which combine to create symptoms such as cough, wheezing and respiratory distress. Because the inflammatory process is highly variable, asthma is a disorder with many possible presentations. It may therefore proceed for years without clinical recognition, and may challenge the most astute diagnostician. It is important for otolaryngologists to be able to suspect, diagnose and treat asthma. This is so because asthma is a common disease in the otolaryngologic patient population, both as one of the options in the differential diagnosis of respiratory complaints, and as a comorbid condition which may complicate the treatment of other medical or surgical problems. Furthermore, both the understanding of asthma's pathophysiology, and its optimum treatment methods have undergone radical changes during the past decade. This three-part discussion reviews our modern understanding of asthma, and proposes diagnosis and treatment guidelines which can assist otolaryngologists in effectively managing their asthmatic patients.

Diagnosis in primary care relies on recognition of a characteristic pattern of symptoms and the occurrence of asthma attacks, sometimes supplemented by basic lung function tests. Ongoing management is guided by the assessment of symptoms and simple lung function measures of airflow obstruction, with little attempt made to personalise management. This approach is flawed because the inadequate specificity of symptoms, as well as the low sensitivity of variable airflow obstruction, means that a diagnosis of asthma is often difficult to exclude with confidence. Moreover, even if diagnosed correctly, dissociation between inflammation, airflow obstruction, and symptoms means that a generalised stepwise approach to managing asthma on the basis of symptoms is unlikely to be successful in a substantial proportion of patients. As a result, effective treatments are used inefficiently, and outcomes are often worse than they could be. Rather than use of either a population-based or personalised approach for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we recommend a new combined approach, in which treatment decisions are driven by objective assessment of key treatable mechanistic traits.",,Dominick E Shaw;Liam G Heaney;Mike Thomas;Richard Beasley;Peter G Gibson;Ian D Pavord

The history search for the presence of an atopic state, the occurrence of similar disorders in members of the same firm and also the timing of symptoms in relation to the occupational activities. Cutaneous tests are particularly helpful in IgE-mediated asthma in relation to the inhalation of animal or vegetable materials of glycoprotein origin. For haptens, the need for their prior coupling to a protein carrier causes problems which have not been entirely resolved. Laboratory tests run into the same snags. Respiratory function and non-specific bronchial provocation tests, confirm the diagnosis of asthma and enable the medium and long term prognostic to be assessed. Specific bronchial provocation tests are the most appropriate tests to establish an aetiological diagnosis in occupational asthma. Different technical methods are possible: quantitative administration of allergen aerosols, realistic tests, and tests using exposure chambers to achieve true test doses.

Immune system is being confused by modern civilization, producing complex interaction among epigenetic regulation, variable extrinsic factors and various combinations of paired effects, i.e. genes, antigens and life periods. It is therefore necessary to answer the question of how to ensure an adequate level of necessary immune stimuli at the time of intensive immune system development until age 6. Advances in immunology have enabled full asthma control but not cure in a great proportion of patients. Therefore, researchers have focused on particular features of specific inflammatory asthma subtypes, i.e. eosinophilic, neutrophilic, mixed and asthma without inflammatory cells. Therapeutic response to inhalant and systemic corticosteroids in a particular subtype is also investigated. The Global Initiative for Asthma Guidelines, developed by the group of experts and regularly updated with new scientific concepts, are available in clinical routine. The guidelines provide a useful framework for the choice of drugs and dosage, but they cannot replace clinician's evaluation in individual approach to patient.

Despite its prevalence, late onset asthma may be misdiagnosed and inadequately treated, with important negative consequences for the patient's health. The histopathology of late onset disease appears to be similar to that of asthma in general, with persistent airway inflammation a characteristic feature. It is less clear, however, that allergic exposure and sensitisation play the same role in the development of disease in adults as they do in children. Atopy is less common among those with late onset asthma, and the prevalence of elevated immunoglobulin E levels is lower among those aged over 55 years of age than younger patients. Occupational asthma is an aetiological consideration unique to adult onset disease, with important implications for treatment. The differential diagnosis for cough, wheeze, and dyspnoea in the elderly is broad, and includes chronic obstructive bronchitis, bronchiectasis, congestive heart failure, lung cancer with endobronchial lesion and vocal cord dysfunction. Keys to accurate diagnosis include a good history and physical examination, the demonstration of reversible airways obstruction on pulmonary function tests and a favorable response to treatment.

In the United States approximately 100,000 workers are exposed to these chemical compounds in the workplace each year and 5-10% of these workers will develop occupational asthma. There are no known reliable risk factors or biomarkers which can be used to predict which exposed worker will develop diisocyanate-occupational asthma. Diisocyanate-occupational asthma workers manifest characteristic physiologic responses after specific bronchoprovocation which correlate with pathologic changes in their airways. However, the mechanism(s) for diisocyanate-occupational asthma remains unclear. Specific IgE antibody production to diisocyanates is found in only 10-30% of these workers. Bronchial biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage have confirmed the presence of T-lymphocytes and eosinophils in the airways of these workers suggesting that T-cell mediated immune responses are more likely to play a central role in this disease. It is essential to diagnose diisocyanate-occupational asthma as early as possible in order to prevent or reduce the significant asthma morbidity associated with continuous long term exposure to these chemicals. Treatment of choice is removal of the worker from further exposure.

Over the last 20-30 years, there has been increasing appreciation that ""severe asthma"" encompasses multiple different subgroups or phenotypes, each with differing presentations. Using clinical phenotyping, in combination with rapidly advancing molecular tools and targeted monoclonal antibodies (human knockouts), the understanding of these phenotypes, and our ability to treat them, have greatly advanced. Type-2 (T2)-high and -low severe asthmas are now easily identified. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide and blood eosinophil counts can be routinely employed in clinical settings to identify these phenotypes and predict responses to specific therapies, meeting the initial goals of precision medicine. Integration of molecular signals, biomarkers, and clinical responses to targeted therapies has enabled identification of critical molecular pathways and, in certain phenotypes, advanced them to near-endotype status. Despite these advances, little guidance is available to determine which class of biologic is appropriate for a given patient, and current ""breakthrough"" therapies remain expensive and even inaccessible to many patients. Many of the most severe asthmas, with and without T2-biomarker elevations, remain poorly understood and treated.

A detailed history is of great importance in raising suspicion of occupational asthma, but studies have shown that even detailed histories obtained by experienced specialists can lead to inaccurate conclusions about the presence or absence of occupational asthma. Consequently, objective measurements should be performed to establish the diagnosis of occupational asthma whenever possible. If the patient is still working in the workplace, work-related changes in spirometry or peak flow measurements can confirm the diagnosis. For occupational asthma from some airborne sensitizers, immediate-type skin testing or in vitro tests for specific IgE may establish sensitization. However, there is evidence that for some isocyanates, in vitro tests for specific IgG serum antibody levels correlate better with documented bronchospasm from isocyanate exposure, even though the IgG antibody is not thought to be pathogenic. Controlled, specific inhalation tests may be valuable, but they should be performed only under experienced medical supervision. Intervention should be focused on reducing or avoiding harmful workplace exposures so that permanent lung impairment and need for chronic medical treatment are avoided. Assessment of permanent impairment/disability from occupational asthma optimally should be determined 2 years after the removal from occupational exposure, when improvement has been shown to plateau and the patient will likely have reached maximal medical improvement.",,M S Dykewicz

The prescription of respiratory physiotherapy should not be routine. It only appears to be indicated in asthmatics with continuous dyspnoea or hypersecretion who are unstable, despite medical treatment which is both correctly prescribed and properly taken. Bronchial drainage, on condition that certain technical precautions are taken, is only useful in asthma with hypersecretion. Asthmatic crises are not relieved by physiotherapy. Standard respiratory exercises could have a certain value on hyperinflation in the chronic asthma of childhood. They are generally without effect on airways resistance or expiratory flow. Likewise, there are reflex massages for relaxation, posture, and respiratory exercises which are borrowed from yoga. Techniques for correction of posture, used preventively, are only of value in chronic asthma of childhood. Respiratory muscle training, in spite of a few successes, is not justified on a theoretical basis, at least in those subjects who have not been subjected to long-term steroid therapy. Overall, exercise training is useful from both the physiological and the psychological point of view. The anaerobic threshold would seem to be the ideal level of intensity for exercise on the basis of 30 minutes, three times a week for subjects who are moderately or severely affected.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11190374/,"Childhood asthma: aspects of global environment, genetics and management","The prevalence of asthma in children dramatically increased over the past two decades. In Taiwan, the prevalence of childhood asthma has risen to around 10% in the 1990s, in contrast to a prevalence of about 1% in the 1970s. Currently, Australia and New Zealand have the highest prevalence in the world (> 15%). African and Asian countries have a low prevalence of about 5 to 10%. In general, countries in coastal, temperate and subtropical zones have the highest mite-sensitive asthma prevalence. Countries in the subarctic or in semiarid areas have a lower prevalence. Indoor allergens such as house dust mites, cockroaches and fungi usually cause perennial asthma; outdoor allergens such as grass and tree pollens as well as outdoor fungi induce seasonal asthma. A gene on chromosome 11q13 is significantly linked to maternal inheritance of asthma, and possibly involves polymorphisms in the beta subunit of the high affinity IgE receptor. Cytokine genes in chromosome 5q31-33 are known to regulate IgE production resulting in various severities of allergic diseases. Recent studies suggest that pollutants such as diesel exhaust, O3, NO2, and SO2, together with allergens and susceptible genes are likely to promote IgE production and allergic reactions. As a result, asthma is apparently not a single gene disorder, but a disease determined by the interaction between gene and environment. In practice, immunopharmacological interventions to block IgE-mediated early bronchospasm and late inflammatory reactions are the major regimens for asthma treatments. This makes possible a step-wise self-management based on portable monitoring of airway resistance using the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Early avoidance of allergen exposure in utero as well as early anti-inflammatory therapy in infancy have decreased the prevalence of allergic diseases. A combination of both strategies may bring much more benefit in the prevention of childhood asthma.

This year's summary will focus on recent advances in pediatric asthma on prenatal and postnatal factors altering the natural history of asthma, assessment of asthma control, and new insights regarding potential therapeutic targets for altering the course of asthma in children, as indicated in Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology publications in 2013 and early 2014. Recent reports continue to shed light on methods to understand factors that influence the course of asthma, methods to assess and communicate levels of control, and new targets for intervention, as well as new immunomodulators. It will now be important to carefully assess risk factors for the development of asthma, as well as the risk for asthma exacerbations, and to improve the way we communicate this information in the health care system. This will allow parents, primary care physicians, specialists, and provider systems to more effectively intervene in altering the course of asthma and to further reduce asthma morbidity and mortality.",Airway remodeling; asthma; asthma control; asthma exacerbations; biomarkers; early intervention in asthma; environment; genetics; inhaled corticosteroids; leukotriene receptor antagonists; long-acting β-adrenergic agonists; personalized medicine; severe asthma; therapeutics.,Stanley J Szefler

Asthma is now recognized as a disease of unknown etiology characterized by a hyperactive airway which can be demonstrated by research techniques or is readily apparent during clinical observations. The role of bioactive mediators in inducing asthma or its basic abnormality, the hyperactive airway, is a major research target as are the roles of neurokinins and inflammation. Management of asthma varies with experience, training and locale of the physician, and various types of available pharmacologic preparations are suitable for control of the intermittent wheezing of the mild asthmatic. As more severe asthma is encountered in individual patients, a more experienced physician and more intense therapy is required. The most severe form of asthma, characterized as PFA, requires intense therapy, close patient physician contact and further intense study, particularly of the psychosocial and economic patterns which interfere with optimal management.",,R Patterson;P A Greenberger

The challenges in management of patients with asthma however are the recognition of the severity of the attack as well as an appreciation of sociobiological factors important in disease management. Recognition of disease severity depends on an appreciation of the child's past medical history, recognition of those prone to near fatal episodes of asthma and a close evaluation for the effect of hypoxia on target organs. Socio-biological factors include the contributions of race, ethnicity, and income and environmental triggers to disease severity and prevalence. Other challenges in asthma management include measurement of airway inflammation, challenges in the delivery of and recognition when emergency care fails, tailoring follow-up treatment, and standardization of hospital care. Intensive care management of asthma is not well standardized and relies on personal preferences and therapies that have not been well studied in children. The future of asthma care however is optimistic in that research to further characterize the pathophysiology of the disease, to standardize treatment options as well as genetic studies to pinpoint asthma susceptibility may lead to treatment being tailored for individual patients rather than using a trial and error approach.",,N Kissoon

The cellular and biochemical mechanisms that take place in them are not well enough understood and, thus, new questions have been added to the ones that existed before the asthma was considered an inflammatory disease. The interactions between cells and inflammation mediators, and between both of them and the autonomous control of the bronchial tree, are still adding new questions and preventing the working-out of a comprehensive theory explaining all the changes observed in asthma. In addition, the recent insights on the relationship between asthma, athopy and hereditary conditionings of both, have significantly increased our body of knowledge on the disease and have open new perspectives that now can be only foreseen. The new concepts related to the pathogenicity of asthma have placed the anti-inflammatory therapy in the first line of the anti-asthmatic therapy.

Some have difficult asthma; in some because the diagnosis is erroneous, in others because of comorbidity or noncompliance. A European Respiratory Society Task Force has called for an integrated approach for these patients, and positive results have been reported using protocols. In the UK, there is no overall understanding of the size of this problem, or how these patients are managed. A postal survey of 683 consultant members of the British Thoracic Society designed to elicit respondents' views on how they would manage four clinical scenarios was conducted. There was a 50.4% response rate. Few reported a uniform approach to the investigation of such patients. The availability of allied healthcare professionals was variable. The 21 consultant respiratory physicans, reporting a special interest in difficult asthma, were significantly more likely to objectively assess compliance, perform skin-prick tests and to utilise a liaison psychiatrist than those without an expressed special interest in asthma. Many reported difficulty in accessing psychologists, liaison psychiatrists and social workers. Approaches to the diagnosis and management of ""vocal cord dysfunction"" were variable. The results of this postal survey of specialist thoracic physicians in the UK suggest that a protocol for difficult asthma is not in widespread use and that access to necessary allied healthcare professionals is not uniform.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1296317/,[Asthma with permanent obstructive ventilation disorder],"Asthma accompanied by chronic airways obstruction (CAO) is frequent and raises difficult clinical problems. Persistent inflammation of the airways is the main factor responsible for obstruction. There are no symptoms that distinguish this form of asthma from non-asthmatic chronic obstructive lung disease, and only respiratory function tests can confirm the diagnosis of CAO. Pharmacological tests with bronchodilators evaluate the bronchomotor part of CAO which is substantial in asthma as opposed to other causes of obstructive lung diseases. A negative test cannot exclude the diagnosis and suggests that the obstructive component due to bronchial inflammation is predominant. In such case a reversibility test performed with corticosteroids is of considerable interest as it reduces the partly reversible inflammatory part of the obstruction. Peak flow curves provide more precise date on the evolutive type of CAO and therefore contribute to a great extent to the monitoring and education of patients. Severe chronic asthma with high annual systemic corticosteroid consumption requires special care and justifies the current attempts made to replace corticosteroids by other anti-inflammatory drugs.",,J Lacronique

About 4% to 9% of adult asthmatics may have occupational asthma. The condition is still under-diagnosed and under-reported. Asking an adult asthma patient whether his or her symptoms improve when away from work and worsen during periods at work is important in detecting potential cases of occupational asthma. Serial peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) monitoring during periods at work and away from work is useful for providing objective documentation of work-relatedness. Specific challenge testing is carried out to confirm a specific causative agent where a new agent is suspected, where there are multiple agents involved and it is important to establish the exact agent, and when it is not possible to carry out serial PEFR monitoring.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3400687/,Epidemiology of nocturnal asthma,"To determine the frequency of nocturnal asthma in a non-hospital-based population, a survey was conducted of asthmatic patients being treated by primary care physicians in many parts of the United Kingdom. Seventy-four percent of the 7,729 patients who participated reported awakening at night at least once a week, and 64 percent reported awakening at least three times a week. Of 3,015 patients who regarded their asthma as mild, 26 percent reported awakening every night, suggesting that many patients underestimate the severity of their asthma. Patients with no nocturnal asthma generally had a lower frequency of allergic and nonallergic trigger factors, but no dominant feature distinguished these patients from those who did awaken at night. As perceived asthma severity increased, so did the number of drug types being prescribed, but no particular drug was identified as being associated with a lower frequency of nocturnal asthma. The frequency of nocturnal asthma found in the survey population (74 percent), in which 48 percent of the patients were using corticosteroid aerosols, was identical to that found in a survey conducted in 1971, when this medication was not yet available. Even though the sampling methods used in the two surveys were different, this finding indicates that the introduction of aerosol steroids has had little effect on the frequency of nocturnal asthma. Current use of existing medication alone may not eliminate the problem of nocturnal asthma, and new drugs and/or new dosing strategies may be needed to control this disabling symptom completely.",,M Turner-Warwick

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3301252/,[Problems of occupationally induced respiratory allergies as exemplified by bakers' asthma],"In the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) approximately every fourth case of occupational lung disease, registered with application for compensation at the ""Gewerbliche Berufsgenossenschaften"", in 1984 was suspected to be caused by allergic airway obstruction. Respiratory allergies may arise if two prerequisites exist firstly exposure to sensitizing agents in the work environment and secondly individual disposition to allergic reactions. The large range of sensitizing agents includes organic and inorganic substances derived from animals, plants, fungi, metals or chemicals. Most of them are responsible for Type-I IgE-mediated allergic reactions. Three different patterns of respiratory responses can be found following simulated occupational exposure: immediate, late (non-immediate), and the dual-type of asthmatic reaction, whereby the non-immediate asthmatic response must be strictly differentiated from the genuine Type-III hypersensitivity. Today, bakers' asthma is the most frequent and most costly occupational allergy in the FRG, contributing more than 50% of all registered and more than 75% of all compensated cases. Therefore, flour allergies can be used as a classic model of an occupational allergic disease in order to discuss epidemiological, social and clinical problems, such as prevalence, socioeconomic impact, as well as prevention, early diagnosis and therapeutic measures. Despite many well-known clinical and epidemiological data, respiratory allergies display a lot of unresolved questions calling for further research.",,H Thiel

Indeed, difficult-to-control asthma symptoms can be caused by other disorders mimicking asthma, by unidentified exacerbating factors, by low compliance with the prescribed therapy, by inability to use the devices correctly (metered-dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers, nebulizers) and by low perceptiveness of airway obstruction. Children and adolescents with severe, difficult-to-treat asthma should receive specialist assessment and follow-up.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11887501/,Exacerbations of asthma: addressing the triggers and treatments,Airway inflammation is known to play a crucial role in chronic asthma and has led to the effective use of anti-inflammatory treatments to control chronic asthma. Despite these improvements exacerbations of asthma continue to occur in subjects with stable disease compliant with treatment. Viral respiratory tract infections have been found to be associated with the majority of asthma exacerbations in both children and adults. Evidence is emerging that viral infections may alter the inflammatory infiltrate present in chronic asthma with a more heterogenous neutrophil/eosinophil infiltrate. The implications are that the pathogenesis of acute asthma may differ from that present in chronic asthma in important ways that may influence the effectiveness of treatment. Inhaled corticosteroids are effective in controlling chronic airway inflammation in asthma but appear not to be as effective in acute asthma. This may mean that new directions will be needed to target specifically the airway inflammation in virus-induced acute asthma.,,P A Wark;P G Gibson;S L Johnston
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2688494/,What I would like to learn about the pathogenesis of asthma,"Recent asthma research has emphasized three important points. First, the disease is increasing in severity and probably in frequency. In the United States this increase is concentrated in the large metropolitan counties. Second, the disease formerly considered bronchospasm and bronchial hyperresponsiveness has become recognized as a particular kind of desquamating eosinophilic bronchitis. Third, helper T lymphocytes, particularly those that produce interleukins 3, 4, and 5 seem to play a central role in the pathogenesis of this inflammation. In this essay, I will expound on these points and speculate on their interpretation and where future research may be fruitful in providing better understanding of the disease.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17523070/,[Global Initiative for Asthma Management and Prevention--GINA 2006],"GINA together with many other national guidelines for the clinical management of asthma recommend a disease severity assessment in order to determine the quantity and frequency of medication. This classification scheme groups patients into one of four categories (intermittent, mild-persistent, moderate-persistent, and severe-persistent). However, it is important to recognise that asthma severity includes both severity of the underlying disease and responsiveness to treatment. In addition, severity is not an unvarying feature in any individual asthma patient and disease severity may change over months or years. Thus, for ongoing asthma management, classification using the level of control may be more relevant and useful in clinical practice. The new version of the GINA guidelines 2006 recognises these limitations of severity assessment and classifies the condition according to the level of control as ""controlled"", ""partly controlled"", and ""uncontrolled"" asthma on the basis of daytime symptoms, restrictions of physical activity, nocturnal symptoms/awakening, need for reliever/rescue medication, lung function (PEF or FEV1) and the frequency of exacerbations. In addition, the patient is assigned to one of five treatment ""steps"". Each step represents treatment options that are alternatives for controlling asthma. Moreover, steps 1 to 5 provide options of increasing efficacy. In order to maintain asthma control regular monitoring and adjustment is essential. In cases where asthma is not or only partially controlled with the current treatment regimen, step-up treatment is recommended whereas disease control allows a gradual stepping-down to the lowest possible dose of medication necessary to maintain control. This novel asthma management approach based on disease control, may facilitate acceptance and use of asthma guidelines in clinical practice.",,C Kroegel
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14629953/,Pathology of difficult asthma,"Severe asthma is poorly understood clinically, physiologically and pathologically. Although milder forms of asthma are generally easily treated, more severe forms remain refractory to the best current medical care. Both genetic and environmental elements are likely to play an important role in the development of severe disease. Physiologically, these patients often have air-trapping, airway collapsibility and loss of elastic recoil. The pathology demonstrates a heterogeneity of findings and is based mainly on adult studies. Some patients demonstrate continued eosinophilic inflammation despite the use of high doses of corticosteroids. At least one-third appear to have pathological changes inconsistent with classically described asthmatic pathology. Persistent inflammation can lead to structural changes involving the airways and perhaps the parenchyma as well. Finally, inflammation and structural changes appear to exist well into the lung periphery, out of reach of many inhaled medications. The importance of each of these factors in the development of severe disease probably varies from patient to patient. Understanding the commonalities of the pathology of severe asthma should, however, lead to the development of improved therapies.",,Sally Wenzel

Children and parents were interviewed about their concepts of asthma etiology, asthma medications, and alternative therapies. Drawings were elicited from children to understand their beliefs about asthma. Nineteen children with 17 mothers from a variety of cultural backgrounds were interviewed. Among children, contagion was the primary EM for asthma etiology (53%). Twenty-five percent of children reported fear of dying from asthma, while fear of their child dying from asthma was reported by 76% of mothers. Mothers reported a variety of EMs, some culturally specific, but the majority reported biomedical concepts of etiology, pathophysiology, and triggers. Although 76% of mothers knew the names of more than one of their children's medications, 47% thought their child's medications all had similar functions. Thirty-five percent of families used herbal treatments and 35% incorporated religion into asthma treatment. Seventy-one percent of families had discontinued medications and 23% reported currently not giving anti-inflammatory medication. Reasons for discontinuing daily medications included fears of unknown side effects (53%), addiction (18%), tachyphylaxis (18%), and feeling that their child was being given too much medicine (23%). The traditional focus of asthma education is not sufficient to ensure adherence. Asthma education for children should address their views of etiology and fears about dying from asthma.

The effects of occupational asthma on health and productivity in the workplace have been so deleterious that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration targeted 1995 as a crisis year for effective remediation. Several risk factors have been identified, but all asthma is multifactorial. Inhaled chemical, physical, and microbiological agents in the form of dust, fumes, gases, and vapors may cause workplace asthma, which is mediated through pharmacologic, immunologic, or irritant mechanisms. Because of the complexity of these mechanisms after exposure to the offending agents, the clinical manifestations may be classed as immediate, delayed, or dual responses. Evaluating causation and relationship to work requires a thorough history (including detailed job description), physical examination, and definitive studies to determine the presence of bronchospasm, bronchial hyperreactivity, atopy, work-relatedness, and presence of specific sensitization. Goals of treatment for occupational asthma are to maintain pulmonary function as close to normal as possible, to maintain a normal lifestyle, and to prevent exacerbation.

Controller medications are dominated by inhaled corticosteroids either alone or in association with inhaled beta-2 sympathomimetics. The main objective is to achieve and to maintain asthma control. Asthma control is assessed using six items which determine whether asthma is controlled, partially controlled or uncontrolled.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17563404/,E-selectin S128R polymorphism leads to severe asthma,"The E-selectin mediates the interaction of activated endothelial cells with leukocytes and plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of asthma. It has been suggested that an S/R (Serine128Arginine) polymorphism of E-selectin alters ligand binding function. Our purpose in this study was to determine whether this Serine128Arginine polymorphism influences the risk of asthma and also to analyze the possible correlation of disease severity in Iranian patients with polymorphism of E-selection. We studied human E-selectin gene polymorphism in 172 asthmatic patients and 173 healthy volunteers by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). To determine the severity of the asthma's situation, a questionnaire was prepared requesting the following information: age, sex, clinical signs and symptoms and past medical history. After the participants filled in the questionnaire, all active or ex-smoker patients were excluded. A trained observer assessed airway reversibility, peak flowmetry and spirometry in asthmatic patients. We found increased serum levels of soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin) in asthmatic patients compared with healthy subjects (P<0. 0001). Frequencies of the SS, SR, and RR genotypes were found as 66.3%, 31.4%, and 2.3% in the patients and 91.9%, 8.1%, and 0.0% in control subjects, respectively. The 128Arg allele was more prevalent in patients than controls (OR 5.78; 95% CI, 3.07-10.86, P<0.0001). However, in this study the polymorphism was not associated with circulating sE-selectin levels. We found a direct correlation between the level of sE-selectin and the severity of asthma (P=0.001). On the other hand, there was a close relation between 128Arginine carriage and disease severity (P<0.0001).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/401728/,The difficult asthmatic,"The most common reason why asthma presents difficulties in management is the failure to treat it with drugs which are appropriate and taken in adequate dosage. An understanding of the pathophysiology and aetiology of asthma is essential if full advantage is to be taken of the wide range of drugs now available for treating it. Airflow obstruction due to bronchial muscle constriction is usually readily reversible by bronchodilators, whereas that due to the inflammatory component of asthma is refractory to the latter and can only be reversed by steroids. Refractory airflow obstruction is liable to be confused with irreversible obstruction which occurs in those patients whose asthma is complicated by chronic obstructive bronchitis or other lung disease. The choice between symptomatic, preventive and suppressive forms of treatment should be made only after a careful assessment has been carried out with objective measurement of airflow obstruction. The Wright peak flow meter is unsurpassed for this purpose. By its means it should be possible to estimate how much of a patient's airflow obstruction is readily reversible, how much is refractory and how much is irreversible. In general, the aim of treatment is to relieve airflow obstruction rather than to counteract supposed aetiological factors. Both doctor and patient must understand the purpose, limitations and possible dangers of any drug which is prescribed. Steroids are the only form of treatment which is effective in persistent refractory asthma. Prejudice against steroids has resulted in many patients being deprived of their benefit, but this situation may change with the recent introduction of steroid aerosols.",,I Gregg

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8050555/,Management of occupational asthma,"The importance of occupational asthma and its management is usefully set in perspective by considering recent trends of increasing asthma incidence, morbidity and mortality in the population at large. The contribution to incidence made by asthma of occupational origin is of the order 20-100 cases per million workers per year; the individual worker's lifetime risk approaching 5% in some industrial environments. Management of the affected industry inevitably follows different pathways from that of the affected individual, though both need to start from a definitive diagnosis. For the affected industry, managers must identify the causative agent and assess the extent of the problem. Affected workers can then be removed from hazardous settings, and meaningful strategies of prevention can be introduced. The most promising preventive measures involve improvements in industrial hygiene or the substitution of alternative agents in the manufacturing process. The role of worker selection (i.e. the exclusion of applicant workers who may be unduly susceptible because they smoke, or have existing airway hyperresponsiveness or atopy) is small and controversial. More valuable is a strict surveillance programme of workers perceived to be at risk, so that emerging disease is recognized promptly, before it poses any major threat of permanent ill-health. Management choices beyond conventional medication and the avoidance of irritant environmental triggers are greatly limited for the affected individual worker. A change of job environment with complete cessation of exposure to the relevant asthma-inducing agent is to be favoured and offers the best chance of full recovery, but may not be practical if the worker is to avoid permanent unemployment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,D J Hendrick
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23264403/,Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 polymorphism in patients with bronchial asthma,"Asthma is considered as a chronic inflammatory airway disease and defined as increased tracheobronchial responsiveness to variety of stimuli. Edema and inflammatory cell infiltration in airway is observed in the asthmatic patients. One of the essential changes in inflammation is adhesion of leukocyte to endothelium and transmigration of leukocytes to the sites of inflammation. Unfortunately, little is known about the role of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) polymorphism in asthma inflammatory process. The purpose of this study was to determine whether PECAM-1 polymorphisms affect the risk of asthma or not.Forty-five asthmatic patients (including 27 men and 18 women) and 45 healthy volunteers (11 men and 34 women) were studied. To determine the severity of the asthmas situation, a questionnaire was prepared asking the following information: age, sex, clinical signs and symptoms and past medical history. All subjects were genotyped for PECAM-1 polymorphism by using amplification refractory mutation system -polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR). The genotype distribution of PECAM-1 80 Val/Met polymorphism in all asthmatic patients were Val/Val while non asthmatic controls were 95.6% Val/Val and 4.4% Val/Met. However, these differences were not statistically significant (p<0.05). The allele and genotype frequencies of PECAM-1 125 Val/Leu polymorphism were significantly different between asthmatic patients and controls. On the other hand, the presence of 125 Leu allele was associated with an increasing risk of asthma with an odds ratio of 2.8 (95% CI; 1.5-5.3, p=0.002).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/482560/,The psychosomatic theory of bronchial asthma,"The author discusses the development of the psychosomatic asthma theory as a paradigm of theory formation in psychomatic medicine. The first formulation of the theory was based on clinical and psychiatric observations. It was tested by psychological, physiological and experimental methods and as a result was reformulated and extended. In its present form it regards asthmatic breathing as a reaction of a predisposed personality structure (partly hereditary, partly acquired during a youth situation in which overprotection by a domineering parent played a large role), to an ambivalent conflict with a key figure. The resulting frustration is not acted out by aggressive, flight, or depressive behaviour, but inhibited; thereby the motoric and verbal discharges are displaced into (substituted by) a respiratory behaviour pattern, which is characterised by an abnormally forceful contraction of the abdominal muscles during the expiration. The resulting high intraabdominal pressure is transmitted into the thorax where it pushes the posterior membranaceous wall of the trachea and large bronchi forward into the lumen and thus produces a long stretched obstruction of the large airways. The passage of the air through the compressed large air passages under high pressure and low velocity is the mechanism which causes the typical wheeze and the other manifestations of the asthmatic airway obstruction. A hypothesis is suggested for the ways in which this psychoneurogenic respiratory behaviour contributes to the so-called bronchial hyper-reactivity and the secondary development of allergies.",,J J Groen

The questionnaire provided information on associated conditions (nasal polyps and intolerance to aspirin) as well as on allergenic and nonallergenic triggers. Data analysis demonstrated that in IA, some airborne nonallergenic factors were significantly more often involved. In addition, this association did hold true when comparing subgroups of patients with normal baseline FEV1 values. For those subjects, PC20 and the slopes of the dose-response curves to metacholine were comparable.

Scarce collaboration of the general practitioners. (2) Unsatisfactory bill on compensation that misunderstands moderate asthma under drug control and asthma with scarce symptoms and occasional therapy. (3) Lack of prevention in industrial medicine. Occupational doctors play a role more relevant in legal activities than in clinical ones.",,M Previdi

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16106739/,[Occupational asthma: current state of the problem],"Occupational asthma is a disease with serious medical, social and economical consequences. Most patients have to change their jobs and very often they lose their professional qualification. This article gives a current review of the problems of occupational bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis in the region of Eastern Bohemia. The results obtained are compared with the situation in the whole Czech Republic and in the world. The number of new cases of occupational asthma and allergic rhinitis discovered in the contact area of the Department of Occupational Medicine at the University Hospital in Hradec Králové fluctuates around 15-20 cases per year, and 80-100 new cases are reported in the whole republic. The rate of occupational asthma and occupational allergic rhinitis of the total asthma and rhinitis incidence in the Czech population fluctuates between 5-15%. Regarding the number of affected employees, flour is considered the most important allergen. Other important noxas include agricultural allergens, textile dust, diisocyanates and disinfectious preparations. The importance of the alergogenius effect of natural rubber latex and diisocyanates has increased in occupational medicine mainly in the last 20 years. Regarding latex, its harmful effect has been especially demonstrated in health providers who wear protective latex gloves, which results not only in contact eczema-dermatitis, but also in bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis. Diisocyanates, highly reactive and aggressive substances, originate during polyurethane production which has a wide industrial application (production of polyurethane foam and rubber, paints, adhesives, injected substances, glues, varnishes etc.). The incidence of occupational asthma diseases in workers exposed to diisocyanates is high. Typically, a development of the disease begins after a short time exposure. In this thesis, a diagnostic method in suspected occupational allergic disease of the airways is suggested and possibilities for the application of particular diagnostic methods are given with emphasis on their advantages and limitations and the necessity to determine a proper diagnostic method for the individual patient. In searching for a particular cause of the occupational disease a significant benefit is the determination of a wide range of specific Ig E class serum antigens, in case IgG and standardization of the method provoke tests for its practical application.",,Karin Bousová

The severity of asthma was graded according to the treatment each required to keep him in reasonable health. Regular exercise tests were performed so that a comparison could be made between the degree of exercise-induced asthma and the severity of the disease. In this group of severe perennial childhood asthmatics profound exercise-induced asthma was found to exist throughout the entire clinical spectrum of the disease with no appreciable difference until the patient became symptom-free. Exercise-induced asthma then disappeared only to return if clinical asthma recurred. This study showed that exercise-induced asthma is a sensitive indicator of clinical asthma but has no prognostic significance in the symptom-free patient.,,L Balfour-Lynn;M Tooley;S Godfrey

A United Kingdom perspective,"The National Asthma Campaign (in the United Kingdom) has recently completed a strategic review of priorities for basic asthma research over the next 5 to 10 years. Leading asthma experts and representatives of the main funding agencies were involved in a nationwide consultation. Discussions were carried out in 7 thematic areas: Genetics of asthma, early-life events, environmental influences, immunology and immunotherapy, inflammation and anti-inflammation, airway remodeling, and the interface between academia and industry. Discussions were not restricted by considerations of financial affordability but were driven by vision and science. The consultation highlighted a number of generic issues pertaining to the organization of basic asthma research. Phenotypes of asthma require more robust characterization, particularly for genetic studies. Emphasis on longitudinal studies should be encouraged, and more information can still be gained from existing well-characterized asthma cohorts, though this requires some coordination. Human research is particularly strong and should continue, and the use of human tissue is vital to our understanding of the disease at the cellular and molecular levels. Animal models of asthma remain an important tool with which to dissect disease mechanisms, but they must be improved and refined. The consultation covered a wide range of issues and highlighted the need for collaboration at all levels between research groups and with industry and also between funding agencies. The recommendations made have relevance to everyone involved in basic asthma research. This article describes the recommendations and reviews the specific research issues relating to each of the 7 thematic areas.",,Matthew P Hallsworth;Philippa J Major;Jack Barnes;Tak H Lee

Data were collected with questionnaires from families with asthmatic children (n=115), 2 to 20 years of age, as part of a larger study of biological and psychosocial factors in asthma and other illnesses. Using parents' reports, we classified the children as early-diagnosed (before age 2) or later-diagnosed (at or after 2) for asthma and compared these groups, separated by gender, in 2 x 2 multivariate analyses. The impacts of all four psychosocially mediated triggers on asthma attacks were significantly greater for the later-diagnosed children than the early-diagnosed children.

The development of sales of the combination product in industrialized countries including Germany shows that they are probably prescribed for first line treatment and for all steps of asthma severity. The role of these recently developed excellent drugs could not yet be defined by principles of evidence based medicine, i. e. by randomized, double-blind controlled trials. A vignette case should demonstrate that in the daily care even grading severity of asthma regarding the prescription of the appropriate treatment can be difficult. Since the costs of the combination treatment are high, nowadays financial considerations increasingly determine medical decisions in the German Health Care System.

Among the different clinical presentations, hyperacute attack with an attack duration (period from onset of attack to mechanical ventilation or to fatality) of less than 3 hours has to be individualized. The agents of choice in the treatment of acute life-threatening asthma are oxygen, beta-adrenergic sympathomimetic amines given intravenously or by nebulization, and corticosteroids. Theophylline is not any more the first choice of treatment but should not be rejected. Anticholinergics given by nebulization in combination with sympathomimetic agents are effective. Beside these treatment, hydratation and antibiotics are important adjunctive treatment.

Of 85 consecutive children, five to 15 years of age, with asthma, 70 (82%) participated in a ten year follow up examination. At the time of referral all children underwent certain tests for asthma (case history, total IgE, skin prick tests, radioallergosorbent tests (RAST) and specific bronchial provocations). On the basis of these tests 24 children had intrinsic asthma and 46 extrinsic asthma. At the follow up examination 60 of the 70 adults (86%; 20 with intrinsic asthma) had current symptoms; 54 of the 60 (90%; 18 with intrinsic asthma) were receiving maintenance therapy. Both FEV1 %pred (from 73% +/- 19% to 92% +/- 17%) and FEV1/FVC (from 75% +/- 13% to 80% +/- 12%) increased significantly from childhood to early adulthood (p < 0.0002 and p < 0.001, respectively); a corresponding amelioration of symptoms was also observed (p < 0.0001). In children with intrinsic asthma the outcome seems to be predicted by a combination of the initial frequency of symptoms (p = 0.04), initial FEV1 (p = 0.001), active smoking (p = 0.001) and age at onset of respiratory symptoms (p = 0.001), whereas the initial FEV1 (p < 0.001) seems to be a strong predictor for the outcome in children with extrinsic asthma.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3400683/,Nocturnal asthma: approach to the patient,"Nocturnal asthma can be diagnosed by asking patients whether they awaken at night with asthmatic symptoms and feel the need to use an aerosol bronchodilator. The primary objective in treating nocturnal asthma is to help patients sleep through the night. The bronchoconstriction that underlies nocturnal asthmatic symptoms is a reflection of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and this hyperresponsiveness is greatly increased by airway inflammation. In patients with allergic asthma, airway inflammation can be reduced by reducing exposure to allergens and, in some cases, by immunotherapy. Nocturnal bronchoconstriction is best controlled by scheduling sustained-release bronchodilators, particularly theophylline, to provide the maximal theophylline blood concentration at the time of maximal obstruction, usually between 4:00 and 6:00 A.M.",,C E Reed;J T Li

Children's asthma needs to be taken seriously by parents, health professionals and teachers. Its severity varies and it is a potentially life-threatening condition. The reason why children develop asthma is not known. Theories include a family tendency to asthma and allergy, house-dust mite and parental smoking. There is no clear evidence of a link between asthma and traffic fumes and air pollution. The vast majority of people with asthma take inhaled steroids, and these produce little or no side-effects. Tablet forms of the drug also have few side-effects if used for short courses of a few days. Only a minority need to take steroid tablets regularly, and need to discuss the issue of side-effects versus improvements in symptoms with their doctor. Most children use a preventer and a reliever medication. It is important that parents and child understand how and when to use each. Research suggests that two-thirds of children may grow out of their asthma symptoms, though asthma that is triggered by an allergic response may recur in later life. The prognosis for pre-school children is good.",,J Appleby

The treatment of acute asthma is now well established, while that of chronic asthma, more difficult to organize, is part of a true therapeutic strategy which has two aspects: 1. A more global approach to the treatment must be developed. This means full management of asthmatic patients who must be instructed and considered as active partners in the prevention of acute attacks, the evaluation of the severity of their disease and the application of the treatment prescribed. 2. An asthma severity scale must be devised and a specific therapeutic programme must be offered for each stage of the disease.

The reasons of such individual variations are different concentrations of cortisol, adrenaline, histamine, cAMP in serum as well as imbalance between vagal and sympathetic interactions. In practice, the early diagnosis of severe nocturnal bronchial constriction is important for prevention of asthma attacks and status asthmaticus. We report on our circadian measurements of airway resistance (Ros) or peak-flow. By adequate therapy an improvement of the individual bronchial tolerance could be achieved, however the biorhythm remained unchanged.

The prevalence in adults (7%) is amongst the highest reported in the world, but the disease is practically absent in children. Whilst the features of the disease are similar to those previously described for asthma in Papua New Guineans, the prevalence is very much higher. Evidence from medical officers and the indigenous population indicates that the disease has only become noticeably prevalent in this area within the last decade, about two decades after first contact with Europeans. The asthma is associated with considerable impairment of resting lung function and is an important source of morbidity and more recently of mortality in these villages. Treatment is unsatisfactory because of both logistic and financial constraints.

The profound redundancy of the inflammatory milieu in the asthmatic airway has resulted in an as yet incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology. Despite tremendous research efforts over the past several decades, defining the asthma phenotype, unraveling its genetics, and accurately diagnosing the condition remain difficult. Application of standardized testing for diagnosis and management of asthma, such that control is maintained and risk of future impairment in the form of exacerbations minimized, is vital. Newer techniques and biomarkers are being developed that may help identify ongoing airway inflammation in a noninvasive and clinically useful fashion. Knowledge of the current treatment armamentarium and its accurate application to maximize effectiveness and reduce risk is also important for all practitioners. New immunomodulatory medications and treatments are being developed that may offer hope for those patients whose asthma is refractory to current treatments. The development and dissemination of new evidence-based guidelines, and strong patient self-management, may help reduce the substantial morbidity suffered by the asthmatic population.

A baseline audit demonstrated satisfactory emergency assessment and treatment, but identified poor compliance with the patient education aspects of the asthma management plan. An evaluation of the literature demonstrated that programs combining asthma education and management were effective when directed towards adults with a recent severe asthma exacerbation. An asthma education and management service was developed to address these deficits. A repeat audit was conducted which identified improvements in asthma control and management skills for patients attending the education program, together with reductions in asthma re-admission rates for patients referred to the service. Ongoing quality assessments will target non-attenders to the service and the maintenance of asthma skills.

However, the significance of AUFVC remains to be clarified. We have clarified that AUFVC reflects the momentum of expired air. Size of flow volume curve (= AUFVC) has been commonly recognized to be changeable visually in patients with asthma. To clarify whether size of flow volume curve (= AUFVC) is a useful index of the course of bronchial asthma, we compared the rate of improvement forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1.0), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) or forced vital capacity (FVC) to the rate of improvement in AUFVC after admission in 20 patients with bronchial asthma. The rate of improvement in AUFVC positively correlated with the rate of improvement in FEV1.0, PEFR or FVC. AUFVC demonstrated more marked improvement than other indices. Since AUFVC reflects the momentum of expired air, bronchial asthma's patients could understand visually that the momentum of expired air decreased due to airway stenosis by presenting flow volume curve. Therefore, visual size of flow volume curve helped patients with asthma to understand the condition of asthma.

Most of these studies have been cross-sectional which substantially limits their power to analyse genotype/phenotype associations. Asthma is a such a highly variable condition that future genotype/phenotype studies should use longitudinal data. Populations with extensive long-term longitudinal data will facilitate more precise definition of phenotype and allow analysis of asthma's natural history. Longitudinal information also means that each phenotypic attribute can be quantified and considered with respect to age. Collecting longitudinal data prospectively would be extremely expensive and take many years. Using existing longitudinal data sets would clearly be much quicker and more economical, but there are very few suitable data sets to be found. Studying a normal and an asthmatic population is ideal and would provide complementary genotype/phenotype information.

In view of the complexity of the asthmatic attack the diagnosis must include all relevant parameters as otherwise consistent treatment is impossible. The only causal therapy is avoidance of exposure to antigens and also to unspecific (physicochemical) noxae which are nearly always superimposed. The value of specific immunotherapy varies according to the antigen or combination of antigens. The final verdict has to await the results of controlled studies in carefully classified and analysed groups, including investigations of immune parameters and uninterrupted registration of exposure to antigens. Until the efficiency, indications and mode of application of immunotherapy have been clearly established desensitization is preferable, provided the allergen has been identified and proved to be active, and exposure to the antigen cannot be avoided. The relatively high success rate obtained with placebos is presumably attributable to concurrent symptomatic treatment and avoidance of contact with the antigen. The already broad spectrum of adjuvent therapy is being constantly and successfully enlarged. Attempts to stimulate the production of antigen-specific suppressor T-cells by denatured antigens, and thereby prevent IgE production, are promising.

Therapy was given for 2 mo to patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Protocol A consisted of a total exercise period of 20 min/wk (10 min/day, 2 days/wk) and was performed by 7 patients (5 cases of asthma and 2 cases of emphysema). Protocol B consisted of a total exercise period of 120 min/wk (20 min x 2 per day at 10:00 am and 3:00 pm, 3 days/wk) and was performed by 9 patients (6 asthmas and 3 emphysemas). Protocol C consisted of a total exercise period of 120 min/wk (20 min/day, 6 days/wk) and was performed by 8 patients (4 asthmas and 4 emphysemas). The ratio of forced expired volume in one second to forced vital capacity (FEV1.0%) was significantly increased in protocols B and C (P < 0.01). The ratio of forced vital capacity to the predicted normal value (%FVC) was not changed in any of the three protocols. A significant increase in peak flow was observed in protocols B and C (P < 0.05). The maximal expiratory flow at 25% (V25) was not changed in any of the three protocols. PaO2 was significantly increased and PacO2 was significantly decreased in protocol B (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively), whereas only PaCO2 was significantly decreased in protocol C (P < 0.05).

Adolescence, with its peculiarities and characteristic psychological and physical changes affects the clinical expression of asthma and above all requires particular diagnostic and therapeutic attention from the treating paediatrician. The physician should act as a direct, credible interlocutor of the adolescent. Regular sporting activity appropriate to the subject's age and asthmatic condition, and under close medical supervision, must be recommended in the asthmatic adolescent. Bronchial asthma in adolescence often presents as asthma due to physical effort. The onset of asthma must not represent an impediment to regular physical activity; adequate management strategies are however necessary (so as to prevent the symptom occurring after effort). These strategies range from the choice of type of training (environment and work loads) to pharmacological prevention measures. The asthmatic adolescent may also perform physical activity at competitive level although in this case special attention must be paid to the choice of drugs so as to avoid running into problems of disqualification due to doping.",,A Marchi;A Ricci

The Pyroglyphidae (of which Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae and Euroglyphus maynei are a part), the Acaridae and the Glyciphagidae which comprise the stock acariens responsible for certain occupational asthmas. After the discovery of the role of mites in respiratory allergy numerous studies have specified the ecological conditions favourable to their development (temperature, relative humidity, the nutritional environment) and have emphasised the beneficial role of altitude and the importance of the characteristics of the habitat. Another avenue of research consists in culture of the acariens, to isolate by immunological chemical purification techniques the glycoproteins responsible to their allergic activity, The studies led to the identification of the major allergens most frequently responsible for sensitizing man. Thus for Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus two major allergens have been identified by different teams. Certain common allergens in different species explain the crossed sensitivity which are frequently observed. One of the major allergens of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, the allergen P, is contained in faecal particles of the acariens. These particles are identified in the domestic environment and are easily made into a suspension by normal household activities. Current preventative methods are orientated towards the effect of exclusion of the acariens on the respiratory symptomatology. The diminution of the mite numbers, a reduced frequency of crisis after complete eviction of the allergens from the home and diminished bronchial reactivity to pharmacological mediators after very prolonged eviction. The use of acaricides or of fungicides would merit more numerous controlled studies with a view to showing their efficacy on the respiratory symptomatology of sensitive subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,J C Bessot;G Pauli

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24777/,Involvement of histamine H1- and H2-receptors in induced asthmas in dogs,"Participation of histamine H1- and H2-receptors in both asthmas, i.e. experimentally induced bronchoconstriction and bronchosecretion, with ascaris suum and histamine in anesthetized dogs was investigated. Dogs given 0.2% histamine solution or ascaris antigen (3 mg protein) by inhalation showed increases in respiratory resistance (Rrs) and respiratory rate to 2.5-5.0 fold. Airway secretion volume was also significantly increased 3-4 fold. The increase in Rrs by histamine inhalation was effectively inhibited or abolished by a histamine H1-receptor antagonist, chlorpheniramine (0.3-1 mg/kg i.v.), but not by a H2-receptor antagonist, cimetidine (1-3 mg/kg i.v.). The increase in Rrs by antigen inhalation was reduced by relatively high doses of chlorpheniramine (1-3 mg/kg i.v.), and not by cimetidine. In contrast, hypersecretion of tracheobronchial fluid in both asthmas was significantly prevented by either chlorpheniramine or cimetidine. Combinations of both antagonists abolished the hypersecretion. Atropine (2 mg/kg i.v.) significantly inhibited the occurrence of responses in both asthmas. The results suggest that histamine is involved in the allergic asthma produced by ascaris suum and that histamine directly evokes airway constriction through H1-receptors and hypersecretion of tracheobronchial fluid through H1- and H2-receptors, and, in part, indirectly activates the cholinergic pathway.",,Y Yamatake;S Sasagawa;S Yanaura;N Kobayashi

The goals of treatment are to relieve hypoxaemia and airflow obstruction as quickly as possible, restore lung function, and provide a suitable plan to avoid relapse. Severe exacerbations are potentially life-threatening and their treatment requires baseline assessment of severity, close monitoring, and frequent reassessment using objective measures of lung function (PEF) and oxygen saturation. Patients at high risk of asthma-related death require particular attention. First-line therapy consists of oxygen supplementation, repeated administration of inhaled short-acting bronchodilators (beta-2-agonists and ipratropium bromide), and early systemic glucocorticosteroids. Intravenous magnesium sulphate and aminophylline are second- and third-line treatment strategies, respectively, for poorly responding patients.

Recently there were some reports on the increasing prevalence of asthma in children from western countries and from other areas of the world. There are numerous different triggers of asthma such as allergens, dust, gases, cold air, infections and malformations of the bronchial system. The release of preformed and new generated mediators is the cause of chronic inflammation in the lungs. The basic defect causing bronchial hyperreagibility of the lungs is still unknown. The therapy of asthma is a longtime treatment, the composition depends of the type and the severety of the asthma to be treated. In addition to the drug therapy, physiotherapy, asthmasports and appropriate climatic conditions are essential tools for the treatment of asthma. The aim of the therapy is a symptom free patient.

The prevalence in the United States and other English-speaking countries is higher than that in most other countries, but worldwide variations cannot be explained by current knowledge of recognized risk or protective factors. According to hospital admission rates, asthma morbidity rates have also risen throughout the world during the past 40 years. These trends are likely due to many different factors, including an increase in the prevalence of severe asthma. Asthma mortality rates gradually declined in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s but have exhibited a substantial, progressive increase during the past 20 years. This trend stands in contrast to those in most other western countries, where asthma mortality rates have generally been decreasing during the 1990s. In both western and developing countries, the considerable economic burden of asthma disproportionately affects individuals with severe disease. This observation illustrates the potential for reducing the costs associated with asthma through management approaches that have been proven to reduce morbidity and mortality.",,Richard Beasley

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1997294/,Bronchial asthma,"Asthma is one of the most common respiratory problems in modern industrialized countries, affecting over 5% of the population. It affects all age groups from infants to senior citizens, and mortality rates from asthma appear to be increasing during the past few years in the United States as well as in other industrialized countries. Asthma tends to occur in families, associated with other allergic disease, and may be induced by a wide variety of environmental antigens, most commonly inhaled allergens such as pollen and dust. Bronchial challenge with a specific allergen results in an early bronchospastic response with a relatively brief duration, and in a significant number of patients there is a late response with onset after 3 to 4 hours, lasting hours to days. This late response is associated with a bronchial hypersensitivity reaction, which is demonstrable by nonspecific challenge testing in the laboratory. During the period of bronchial hyperresponsiveness patients are prone to develop attacks following exposure to a wide variety of ""triggers,"" including cold air, fumes, or cigarette smoke. The current approach to management of patients with asthma emphasizes prevention, with avoidance of specific allergens when possible, and chronic use of anti-inflammatory agents including corticosteroids and cromolyn sodium. The goal is to decrease the bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Management of the acute asthma attack consists of bronchodilator therapy, primarily with inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists, and administration of oral or systemic corticosteroids if the attack is not rapidly relieved. Additional therapeutic agents including theophylline and anticholinergics may be useful in some situations. Response to therapy during the first couple of hours in the emergency room is the most important predictor of the course of the acute attack, and patients who have not responded significantly after 2 hours of maximum therapy are candidates for hospital admission or prolonged emergency room observation. The goal of acute therapy is to wean the patient from intravenous drugs and place him or her on rapidly tapering doses of oral prednisone while initiating a vigorous program of preventive therapy. Follow-up observation, both in the office and in the patient's home, is vital and involves extensive patient education and objective testing of peak airflow. In general, the course of asthma is relatively benign compared with other obstructive airway diseases; however, significant mortality exists, especially in older patients and those with late-onset asthma.",,R B George;M W Owens

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32687905/,The Role of Aeroallergen Sensitization Testing in Asthma Management,"Asthma is a global disease affecting almost 400 million people. Simultaneously, the overall burden of allergies is increasing. Although allergies are frequent and commonly recognized triggers of asthma severity and exacerbations, the majority of patients with asthma are not investigated for their underlying aeroallergen sensitizations, despite the potentially preventable consequences and therapeutic options. This review summarizes the current state of aeroallergen sensitization testing for people with asthma. We describe who should be tested and why, how testing can be used to optimize asthma management, list barriers to implementation of effective asthma management strategies, and make recommendations for improving asthma/allergy management by aeroallergen testing. Establishing a diagnosis of asthma and determining whether there is an allergic component is fundamental to an effective treatment plan. Moreover, moving from severity-based to phenotype-based asthma care can improve the care of asthma and allergic diseases. Timely diagnosis of aeroallergen sensitizations forms the basis for individualized treatment plans, which may include allergen remediation strategies when appropriate, and allergen immunotherapy, the only immunomodulating therapy for allergic asthma. Finally, the advent of biologics will expand the number of patients who can benefit from treatment, with decreased symptoms and disease remission a possibility for the first time.",Allergy; Asthma; Component resolved diagnostics; Sensitization; Specific IgE.,Thomas B Casale;Soren Pedersen;Pablo Rodriguez Del Rio;Andrew H Liu;Pascal Demoly;David Price
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14763371/,"Asthma, allergy, and upper airway disease","The practitioner must be aware of the strong interrelationship between asthma, allergy, eczema, otitis media, viral upper respiratory infection, and sinusitis. When allergy, eczema, otitis media (particularly after the age of 2 years), viral upper respiratory infection, or sinusitis is present in a patient, asthma must be considered as possible sequelae. If a patient has symptoms of intermittent or persistent asthma, consideration must be given to the presence of allergy, eczema, otitis media, viral upper respiratory infection, or sinusitis as comorbid conditions or possible triggers for the asthma symptoms. Failure to evaluate the entire upper and lower airway for these interrelated conditions will result in incomplete treatment and incomplete symptom relief [61]. This article reviews the strong association between diseases of the upper and lower airway [62,63]. Treatment and control of upper airway symptoms is essential for control of asthma symptoms. Control of allergy, eczema, otitis, sinusitis, and viral symptoms result in improved outcomes for asthma patients.

There are over 800,000 teenagers in the UK who suffer from asthma and underdiagnosis and poor treatment are common. The prevalence and level of morbidity from asthma in adolescents are as high as or higher than the rates in younger schoolchildren. Poor symptom control frequently reflects poor compliance with treatment. The beliefs and fears of teenagers about their asthma and its treatment are often not recognised or addressed in clinical consultations. Improved communication on the part of health professionals, which results in negotiating simple management plans that are tailored to the individual patient's concerns and goals, is more likely to improve compliance and asthma control than are complex plans made unilaterally by the doctor.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9042028/,Future directions in asthma therapy. Is a cure possible?,"Asthma correctly is characterized as a syndrome rather than a disease, because a single causative mechanism has not yet been defined. This lack of definition makes the search for a cure extremely complex. Until a common pathogenetic link is identified, the possibility of a cure is remote. The precise nature of the inflammatory response in asthma has not been defined, and current concepts of the pathogenesis of asthma represent, to some extent, a reductionistic approach to a process that has been seen variously as an allergic reaction, autonomic hyperresponsiveness, or both. Additional evidence of the polygenomic nature of the disease and the inability to define a specific pathogenetic process linked to a final common pathway suggest that gene therapies probably will not be feasible, at least for the near future. As expected, most approaches now being developed are directed toward improved therapies, and optimal treatment may obviate the need to develop complex therapies effecting a cure. Under any circumstance, the notion of a cure will have to await a more comprehensive understanding of the syndrome known as human asthma. This article is intended to provide provocative insights into the reasons why a cure remains elusive.",,A R Leff

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8234967/,Epidemiology and the concept of underlying mechanisms of nocturnal asthma,"Nocturnal symptoms are common in asthma, even when patients are regularly seen at an outpatient clinic. Inflammation is generally accepted as a general feature of asthma and the severity of this basic inflammatory process can be increased by exogenous triggers such as exposure to allergens and nonallergic stimuli. Superimposed endogenous circadian rhythms may play a more important and intricate role in the circadian modulation of the inflammatory process by changing the number of cells, their release of mediators and/or the susceptibility of airway smooth muscle and vasculature. For instance, an increase in vagal tone may induce nocturnal bronchoconstriction which is further enhanced by falling catecholamine levels. Together, the reduced nocturnal catecholamine levels and the diminished bronchodilating capacity of the NANC system and the low cortisol levels oppose possible protection against inflammatory processes leading to nocturnal airflow obstruction.",,W M van Aalderen;G G Meijer;Y Oosterhoff;A O Bron

But asthma also is an inflammatory disease with paroxysmal clinical picture. It is known that migraine and trigeminal neuralgia also are inflammatory diseases with paroxysmal clinical picture, and neurogenic inflammation plays important role in their mechanisms. Antiepileptic drugs are highly effective in pharmacotherapy of migraine and trigeminal neuralgia, and these drugs completely prevent attacks of migraine and trigeminal pain in great majority of cases. Due to this it is possible that some antiepileptic drugs may be highly effective in pharmacotherapy of asthma. Bronchial asthma can be considered as peripheral paroxysmal and inflammatory disease with definite central neurogenic mechanism. It is also possible that some antiepileptic drugs can suppress inflammatory processes in asthma through the central neural influence, like in therapy of migraine and trigeminal neuralgia.",,M Lomia

The transition phase included a need to integrate knowledge, experience and self-awareness before progressing to acceptance and control. A mentoring relationship greatly facilitated resolution of the transition phase. Progress along the continuum was accompanied by diminishing fear. Another important theme to emerge was the fact that tiredness and physical limitations were common feelings, irrespective of the severity of the asthma in medical terms.

Diagnosis cannot always rely on history alone and may require an objective exercise challenge or surrogate measure. Management of EIB may require reduction in the exercise provoking the asthma but it can usually be successfully managed with training and the appropriate use of medications, including inhaled beta-agonists, inhaled steroids, and/or leukotriene antagonists.

To assess this accurately, health economic evaluations need to be undertaken in relevant settings, on representative populations. They need to use appropriate measures of asthma outcome. Drug-related costs need to take into account savings made by decreased costs of other prescribed medication and patient factors must be taken into account.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14720017/,Psychiatric factors in asthma: implications for diagnosis and therapy,"Emotional factors are an obstacle in the diagnosis and management of asthma. This review discusses three problem patterns: negative emotions in relatively normal patients with asthma; patients presenting possible functional symptoms and; patients presenting asthma in conjunction with psychiatric deviations. Negative emotions influence the symptoms and management of asthma, even in relatively normal patients. Psychogenic symptoms appear normal, but culminate in functional symptoms in a minority of patients. Diagnosing and treating asthma in patients with comorbid asthma and psychiatric symptoms is very difficult. On the one hand, treating asthma may often be just treating the emotions. On the other hand, negative emotions make the treatment of asthma guesswork. Physicians should estimate emotional influences in their patients' symptoms for an optimal evaluation of medication efficacy. Assessment and analysis of emotional factors surrounding exacerbations seems essential, e.g. emotional precipitants of asthma and asthma-evoked negative emotions. Moreover, patients should be informed about stress-induced breathlessness and the consequences of overuse of bronchodilators. When patients present with atypical symptoms, or do not properly respond to asthma medication, functional symptoms should be suspected. Psychiatric analysis may often lead to the conclusion that symptoms have a functional basis. In patients with comorbid asthma and anxiety disorders, asthma should be the focus for treatment since difficult-to-control asthma often causes anxiety problems in the first place. Moreover, panic-like symptoms in asthma are often related to sudden onset asthma exacerbations. However, in patients with comorbid asthma and depression, depression should become the focus of treatment. The reason is that optimal treatment of depressive asthmatics is probably impossible.

Many factors are responsible for such an outcome: asphyxia +3 due to ventilation/perfusion mismatch and/or bronchospasm, cardiac failure, cardiac arrhythmia, intrinsic positive expiratory pressure, or metabolic disturbances (hypokalemia, for example). Such problems can occur in predisposed patients: it has been shown that the chemosensitivity to hypoxia and the perception of dyspnoea are altered in certain patients with near-fatal asthma. It is very important to identify children at risk of severe asthma and to organize care so as to optimize the management of such children.",,M Fayon;T Lamireau;J Sarlangue;J L Demarquez

The main event is airflow obstruction, caused by widespread airway narrowing due to bronchospasm, mucus secretion, hypersecretion and inflammatory mucosal edema. Airway inflammation seems to be the most important factor associated with release of chemical mediators and the cellular phase of inflammation. Origin of this activation may involve exposure to environmental stimuli such as allergens, infection or pollutants. Bronchial hyperreactivity probably develops at the same time although genetic factors are likely to predispose the children to develop hyperresponsiveness. Different processes can result in bronchial obstruction and explain the forms of asthma in young children: allergic, infectious or complex asthma. Since the bronchial inflammatory reaction appears to be the most important factor in the subsequent development of asthma in young children, steroid inhalation is advocated, associated with conventional therapy.",,D Lesbros

Previous experience of bronchoconstriction was assessed in the 481 subjects with measurable airway responsiveness (PD20FEV1 < 6400 g) by asking 'have you ever felt like this before' at the end of their methacholine challenge tests, i.e. when the subjects were bronchoconstricted by FEV1 decrements of at least 20%. The responses to this question bore no relationship to the previously administered questionnaire responses about wheezing, chest tightness, coughing, or breathlessness. However, there was an inverse relationship with PD20FEV1 measurements (P < 0.001), the positive response rate to the question falling from 92% among those with PD20FEV1 < 50 micrograms to 27% among those with PD20FEV1 in the highest measurable range (3200-6400 micrograms).

Nonetheless, there are still many problems related to the identification and validation of asthma phenotypes and endotypes. Alternatively, a precision-medicine strategy for the management of patients with airways disease that is free from the traditional diagnostic labels and based on identifying ""treatable traits"" in each patient might be preferable.

By both methods especially by drugs the inflammation in the airways should be decreased. According to the modern concepts of pathogenesis of asthma the bronchial hyperresponsiveness might be reduced together with the causes of the symptoms of asthma. For the preventive treatment of all but mild forms of asthma in most asthmatics the therapy of three parallel ways should be applied: bronchodilators in aerosol and/or perorally, anti-allergic inflammatory drugs as well as corticosteroids in aerosol only in exceptional cases per os. According to the clinical effect and lung function (measurement of PEF at home) the drugs and doses are changed. In acute aggravation of asthma when bronchodilators are not sufficient the corticosteroids should be added parenterally in high doses with special attention on beta agonists in inhalation of increased doses after the corticosteroids had been applied.",,J Furlan

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12928075/,Heterogeneity in the pathology and treatment of asthma,"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that is characterized by intermittent and at least partially reversible bronchoconstriction, as well as by airway hyperresponsiveness to a wide variety of stimuli. Asthma and other allergic disorders are thought to be due to an imbalance between the T-helper (T(H)) type 2 (T(H)2) and Type 1 (T(H)1) branches of the immune system, which are responsible for allergic inflammatory reactions and delayed hypersensitivity reactions, respectively. Pathologically, asthma is typically characterized by eosinophil activation and infiltration of the airways under the direction of T(H)2 lymphocytes. However, a subset of individuals with asthma lack eosinophils in their airways; instead they exhibit increased neutrophils. This heterogeneity in asthma also applies to treatment; that is, a significant minority of patients with asthma have been shown to be unresponsive to asthma medications, including leukotriene receptor antagonists and inhaled corticosteroids. Such phenotypic differences in asthma are probably due to multiple factors, including differences in individuals' genetic backgrounds and environmental exposures, as well as the presence of associated conditions such as rhinosinusitis and gastroesophageal reflux.

The younger the infant (both at age of onset and at age of evaluation) the more likely are foods to be important factors in his allergic respiratory disease. His disease is unlikely to interfere with growth during infancy but may do so later in life. Hyposensitization is more likely to be required later in childhood if he does not respond to dietary manipulation.

The data presented in this review demonstrate that adoption of a low sodium diet for a period of 2-5 weeks may improve lung function and decrease bronchial reactivity in adults with asthma, while sodium loading appears to have a detrimental effect. Similarly, a low sodium diet maintained for 1-2 weeks decreases bronchoconstriction in response to exercise in individuals with asthma. There is no data as to the longer-term effect of a low sodium diet on either the prevalence or severity of asthma or on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. As a low sodium diet has other beneficial health effects, it can be considered as a therapeutic option for adults with asthma, although it should be considered as an adjunctive intervention to supplement optimal pharmacological management of asthma and not as an alternative. If the relationship between higher sodium intake and increased prevalence and severity of asthma is causal, then there are potential population benefits for asthma as well as cardiovascular disease to be derived from public health measures to reduce sodium consumption.",,T D Mickleborough;A Fogarty

Lung ultrasonography was carried out on six healthy horses (controls) and 12 horses with asthma (six with mild and six with severe asthma). The sonographic changes in three lung sections were assessed using a scoring system. The most common changes present in all the animals were comet- tail artefacts. More advanced lesions were present in horses with severe asthma. Statistically significant differences in the overall average intensity of the ultrasound changes were seen between the controls and the study group and between the horses with mild and severe asthma. The lesions were usually located in the caudal lung regions, but they were also present in other areas as the disease progressed. Ultrasonography is a useful additional diagnostic tool enabling an assessment of the stage of the asthma progression. It is a very sensitive technique that visualizes minor lesions in the lung tissue even in clinically healthy animals.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10069405/,Improving outcomes in elderly patients with asthma,"Although often regarded as a disease of childhood, asthma is common in elderly people. Although recent figures show a decline over the past few years in the number of asthma deaths in children and younger adults, the same is not true of older adults, in whom most asthma deaths occur. Differences between asthma in young and old patients are seen not only in response to treatment. The nonspecific presentation of asthma in elderly adults means that the diagnosis of asthma is difficult to make. In addition, research suggests that physicians are reluctant to use spirometry and measurement of reversibility when investigating respiratory symptoms in old people. This leads to a tendency to label breathless or wheezy elderly patients as having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) rather than asthma. In turn, patients with a diagnosis of COPD are less likely to be treated with bronchodilators and corticosteroids. Treatment guidelines for the management of asthma in children and younger adults may need to be adapted when applied to older patients. Reduced perception of bronchoconstriction may lead to underuse of bronchodilators prescribed 'as required'. The bronchodilator response to beta2-agonists is attenuated as part of the normal aging process, and other groups of bronchodilator medications should be considered. Inhaler technique can be a particular problem in elderly patients with asthma, requiring careful choice of inhaler device. However, the frequent presence of multiple pathology and multiple medication in this age group enhances the risk of adverse effects from oral preparations, and so the inhaled route should be preferred wherever possible. Underestimation of the severity of an acute exacerbation of asthma by both patient and doctor has been suggested as a contributory factor to poor outcome in older people. Since the cardiovascular responses to hypoxia and bronchoconstriction tend to diminish with increasing age, objective measures of asthma severity (peak flow monitoring and blood gas estimation) are essential in this age group.",,D S Renwick;M J Connolly

These comorbidities have been proposed as ""treatable traits"" in chronic airways disease, adding impetus to their evaluation and management in difficult asthma. In this review, eight major asthma-related comorbidities are discussed: rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, obstructive sleep apnoea, vocal cord dysfunction, obesity, dysfunctional breathing and anxiety/depression. We describe the prevalence, impact and treatment effects of these comorbidities in the difficult asthma population, emphasizing gaps in the current literature.

Disparities are seen not only among physicians overall but also among primary care physicians compared with subspecialists. New survey data help to illustrate how reality--the clinical approaches of these physician subgroups--differs from current recommendations.

The results of screening on asthma (questionnaire, spirometry) were compared with the diagnosis made in general practice. Screening results served as the reference standard. Four general practices forming the Continuous Morbidity Registration, Nijmegen were used. Five-hundred and fifty-one subjects aged 10-23, registered since their birth till the year of the study (1989) on the practice lists of these practices were involved in the study. The data collected included: (i) all episodes of respiratory morbidity in their life presented in general practice; (ii) socioeconomic level and family history of asthma; and (iii) current respiratory status, allergy to inhalant allergens and smoking behaviour (questionnaire, spirometry, histamine-challenge test and Phadiatop-test). The screening identified asthma in 19% of the study subjects, of whom 56% not had been recognized in general practice. Of the asthmatics recognized in general practice, significantly more were boys, had presented acute bronchitis in the last 5 years preceding this study and had a family history of asthma than those not recognized. Of the latter, 30% had not presented any respiratory disease in the last 5 years to their general practitioner (GP). This study suggests underdiagnosis of asthma in adolescents and young adults. Asthmatics are more likely to be recognized by their GPs in case of male sex, previous diagnosis of acute bronchitis and a family history of asthma. Reluctance of some patients to consult their doctor and low perception of symptoms may play a role in underdiagnosis.",,B Kolnaar;E Beissel;W J van den Bosch;H Folgering;H J van den Hoogen;C van Weel

These conditions are associated with a significant and increasing disease burden. The diagnosis and management of asthma and COPD in older populations are complex, and consequently clinicians are faced with many therapeutic and diagnostic challenges. Both aging and obstructive airway diseases are associated with complex co-morbidities and these coexisting illnesses confound management. Moreover, the age-related physiological changes that occur in the lungs may lead to airflow limitation, and this may be difficult to distinguish from an active disease state. In practice, management of asthma and COPD is informed by disease-specific clinical practice guidelines; however, most older people with these conditions are excluded from clinical trials that are designed to inform practice, creating major evidence gaps. Furthermore, seldom do clinical practice guidelines consider the complexities of management in older populations. The problems experienced by older people are complex and multifactorial and our approach to management must reflect these challenges. Opportunities exist to improve the management and outcomes for older people with obstructive airway disease and there is an urgent need for clinical trials to test management approaches in this population; current research must consider the challenges and evidence gaps that exist.",,Vanessa M McDonald;Isabel Higgins;Peter G Gibson

Atopic asthma is found to be strongly familial, however the mode of inheritance is controversial. A large number of studies have been carried out and a number of candidate genes have been identified. In addition, a number of chromosomal regions have been identified using genome-wide scans, which might contain important unknown genes. It has been shown in studies carried out in different populations that the genetic predisposition varies with ethnicity. In other words, genes that are associated with asthma in one population may not be associated with asthma in another population. In addition to the involvement of multiple genes, gene-gene interactions play a significant role in asthma. The importance of environmental factors in asthma is beyond doubt. However, it remains controversial whether a cleaner environment or increased pollution is a trigger for asthma. Despite the increasing prevalence of the disorder, only a limited number of therapeutic modalities are available for the treatment.

The model emphasizes the multidirectional influences that affect the severity of asthma and associated behavioral disability. The initial focus is on how the clinical presentation and morbidity of asthma are affected both by somatic predisposition and by interactions with multiple internal and external elements. Specific elements include emotional factors, neuroimmunology, temperament, and medication side effects. Second, the impact of asthma on the child, his or her family, and segments of the community are described, as are consequences of the disorder on quality of life. Third, there is a synopsis of preventative interventions for reducing the medical and behavioral impact of childhood asthma. The motif is that the interaction of medical and behavioral procedures can improve the management of asthma while consequences of the disorder are mollified. Finally, as examples of a transactional model of asthma, self-management programs for teaching children to become partners with their physicians in establishing and maintaining control over the disorder are described. A representative of self-management--the ACT (Asthma Care Training) program--is described, along with the impact such programs have on children, their families, and institutions. The conclusion emphasizes that asthma is a complicated and unpredictable disorder that puzzles physicians, behavioral scientists, and patients.

OA is important to recognize clinically, because it has serious medical and socioeconomic consequences. Diagnosis of OA should be confirmed by objective testing early after its onset.

Data-driven methodologies facilitate the discovery of ""hidden"" structures within ""big healthcare data"" to help generate new hypotheses. These findings can be translated into clinical practice by linking discovered ""phenotypes"" to specific mechanisms and clinical presentations. Epidemiological studies have provided important clues about mechanistic avenues that should be pursued to identify interventions to prevent the development or alter the natural history of asthma-related diseases. Findings from cohort studies followed by mechanistic studies in humans and in neonatal mouse models provided evidence that environments such as traditional farming may offer protection by modulating innate immune responses and that impaired innate immunity may increase susceptibility. The key question of which component of these exposures can be translated into interventions requires confirmation. Increasing mechanistic evidence is demonstrating that shaping the microbiome in early life may modulate immune function to confer protection. Iterative dialogue and continuous interaction between experts with different but complementary skill sets, including data scientists who generate information about the hidden structures within ""big data"" assets, and medical professionals, epidemiologists, basic scientists, and geneticists who provide critical clinical and mechanistic insights about the mechanisms underpinning the architecture of the heterogeneity, are keys to delivering mechanism-based stratified treatments and prevention.",asthma mechanism; children; machine learning.,Sejal Saglani;Adnan Custovic

The conventional therapeutic approach is based on oxygen therapy and on the combined treatment of inhaled beta2-agonists at repeated doses and systemic corticosteroids. Inhaled or systemic magnesium sulfate is also recommended. The unresponsiveness to the initial bronchodilating therapy and the development of respiratory distress requiring intubation significantly increases mortality, due to the complications induced by mechanical ventilation. In these situations, a ventilatory strategy, including controlled hypoventilation with permissive hypercapnia, aiming at preventing lung hyperinflation, is indicated. Non-invasive ventilation may be successful in certain patients and represents an effective alternative to intubation.

The incidence of occupational asthma principally depends on the agent and level of exposure. The property of a small molecular weight chemical to bind to and alter the structure of body proteins seems important. Smoking both increases the number of workers developing specific IgE to occupational agents, and the number developing occupational asthma.

Nonapproved interventions of potential benefit are ultrahigh-dose inhaled corticosteroids, anticholinergic bronchodilators (tiotropium), macrolide antibiotics, and vitamin D supplementation for the vitamin D-deficient patient. Potentially toxic, ""steroid-sparing"" therapies such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, and etanercept are best reserved for patients participating in clinical trials. Recognition of specific subtypes of patients with therapy-resistant asthma permits more targeted treatment approaches, such as for aspirin-sensitive asthma, persistent eosinophilic asthma, asthma complicated by allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, asthma with persistent airflow obstruction, and asthma with life-threatening (near fatal) asthmatic attacks.

Severe asthma results in increased risk of adverse outcomes whilst contributing significantly to the economic burden on the nation's health resources. The ERS / ATS guidelines were published in 2014 and form the basis of identifying, evaluating and managing severe asthmatic children. However, much of this evidence is extrapolated from adult studies and may be inappropriate in children as unlike adults, children have a more atopic phenotype. Severe asthma is an umbrella term and may represent several overlapping heterogeneous wheezing entities. This chapter aims at discussing the strategies employed in managing severe asthmatic children with particular focus on diagnostic challenges and management pitfalls. Particular emphasis is put into the logical and systematic approach to a child with severe asthma and describes the multidisciplinary approach to manage these children.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17595038/,Early life events in asthma--diet,"It has been hypothesized that the recent increase in the prevalence of asthma may, in part, be a consequence of changing diet. There is now increasing interest in the possibility that childhood asthma may be influenced by maternal diet during pregnancy and/or diet during early childhood. A number of observational studies and a childhood fish oil supplementation study provide little support for the notion that early childhood intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) influence the development of childhood asthma. Recent work however, suggests that supplementation of maternal diet with fish oil is associated with altered neonatal immune responses to allergens. Further work is required to establish whether this immunological observation is translated into clinical outcomes. Two birth cohorts have now reported reduced maternal intake of vitamin E, zinc and vitamin D during pregnancy to be associated with increased asthma and wheezing outcomes in children up to the age of 5 years. Early life diet could modulate the likelihood of childhood asthma by affecting fetal airway development and/or influencing the initial early life interactions between allergens and the immune system. In animal models, vitamin E, zinc and vitamin D have been shown to modify fetal lung development and vitamin E, zinc, vitamin D and PUFA can modulate T-cell responses. Further research, particularly, early life intervention studies need to be carried out to establish whether early life dietary intervention can be used as a public health measure to reduce the prevalence of childhood asthma.",,Graham Devereux

The prevalence of asthma in childhood is independent of allergen exposure in early life. Asthma occurs in a substantial number of young children in the absence of allergen sensitisation. Asthma and allergic sensitisation have increased in recent decades, but there is no conclusive evidence that this is due to changes in environmental allergens. What we need to know: Have changes in environmental allergens contributed to the increasing incidence of asthma in recent decades?

The pathogenesis of asthma is only partly understood, and there is an urgent need for improved therapeutic strategies for this disease. Microarray technology has considerable promise as a tool for discovery of novel asthma therapeutic targets, although the field is still in its infancy. A number of studies have described expression profiles derived from human asthmatic lung tissue, mouse airway tissue, or from key cell types associated with asthma, but to date relatively few studies have exploited these findings to discover new pathways involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. Among the genes to have been identified by array studies and validated by further studies are monokine induced by interferon (IFN)-gamma, fatty acid binding proteins (FABP), and complement factor 5 (C5). Here we provide examples of microarray approaches to the discovery of new molecules associated with asthma.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23708109/,Global strategies for reducing the burden from asthma,"Asthma is one of the most important chronic diseases in childhood. For several decades, a steady increase in prevalence has been observed worldwide. In the structural collaboration between the Centre for Population Health Services in Edinburgh and the Research Institute CAPHRI of Maastricht we investigated the possibilities for primary prevention of asthma in childhood. We found that a multifaceted approach might be effective in delaying or preventing asthma, whereas a mono-intervention does not seem to have such a protective effect. The most likely explanation is that the development of a multifactorial disease, such as asthma, is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to prevent by eliminating only one risk factor. Underdiagnosis of asthma is still a big problem in primary care. Most patients do not present bronchial symptoms to the general practitioner, even though they have decreased lung function, so they remain unknown and undiagnosed. However, patients who do present with respiratory problems and who have reduced lung function are not always recognised as such. We found that the perception of dyspnoea seems to determine, at least in part, the presentation to the general practitioner with symptoms. These observations show that both the prevention of the development of asthma in early childhood, as well as case finding of asthma in adulthood, do not seem to be very effective in primary care.

We conducted the ACQUIRE-2 study (NCT02640742) to evaluate level of asthma control, asthma symptoms, health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), and reliever medication use in this setting. Methods: This observational study was undertaken between December 2015 and June 2016 in 58 medical institutions across Japan. We enrolled outpatients aged ≥20 years diagnosed with asthma for ≥1 year who were being managed by specialists.

I found that asthma investigators used no consistent classification scheme for asthma severity, and the level of agreement amongst specialists when categorizing patients with asthma was low. Asthma severity has been classified using a wide range of parameters including medication use, asthma symptoms, lung function, hospitalizations and incidence of exacerbations. Most studies showed a general association between asthma severity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) such that patients with severe disease suffered greater impairment. However, few patients with mild asthma enjoyed unimpaired HRQoL. Indeed depression and impaired HRQoL were reported as frequently in patients with mild asthma as in those with more severe disease. Although in general severe patients used the most health care resources, even patients with mild asthma used considerable health care resources including emergency room care and hospitalizations. In summary, the term 'mild' when applied to asthma is potentially misleading given the impaired HRQoL and avoidable health care utilization prevalent amongst such patients. The application of disease severity classification in clinical asthma management has not been validated. It may now be appropriate to examine these classifications more critically in order to determine if they have clinical or research usefulness. By contrast, the strategy of treating to achieve disease control has been validated and offers the advantage of simplicity in its application.",,K R Chapman

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8404012/,Childhood asthma: diagnosis and treatment,"This discussion of asthma management should be regarded as providing guidelines, not dogma. The underlying principles of asthma management include recognition of the variability of the disease and the importance of the underlying inflammatory condition. Clinical assessment is not enough and objective monitoring with PEFR or spirometry provides important data. The treatment protocols require individualization. It is important that the patient and family are team members working together with the medical staff toward a goal of good asthma management. In the discussion of the management of asthma, much emphasis was placed on spirometry and home measurement of PEFR. Office use of spirometry is now the norm for asthma management. Providing asthmatic patients with peak flow meters and instructions in their use is part of the routine care of asthma. Instruction of the patient and family in the proper use of medications is paramount. The MDI devices need to be prescribed with careful instructions regarding their use. When the patient comes in for follow-up, part of the examination should include the patient's demonstration of how he uses this device. Discussion of the proper and safe use of bronchodilators is important. Overuse of inhaled bronchodilators may be a reflection of increasing asthma or, at the very least, evidence that the patient does not understand appropriate treatment of asthma. If a patient is dependent on regular use of an inhaled beta agent, it is likely that he would benefit from therapy directed at the underlying inflammation of asthma. The patient and the family should understand the purpose of each medication, the side effects, and the risks and benefits of their use. In particular, if steroid medications are necessary, the reasons for their use should be explained. Carefully matching the severity of the asthma with the therapeutic protocols provides an organized approach to asthma treatment. Avoiding triggers of asthma and controlling the environmental exposure to potential triggers leads to lower medication requirements and less lability. Offering the family written instructions to cope with changes in the child's condition, based on assessment of clinical and PEFR observations, allows them more autonomy and comfort in the day-to-day care of the asthmatic child.",,L Smith

This article describes near-fatal asthma and identifies risk factors specifically for the elderly. Symptoms of asthma are reviewed as well as assessments and diagnostic tests to identify asthma severity and complications. Proper management needs to be urgently initiated to prevent worsening respiratory distress; this includes fast-acting drug treatments appropriate for elderly patients.

Although we have recognized some remarkable accomplishments in reducing asthma mortality and morbidity, the availability of new tools to monitor disease activity, including biomarkers and epigenetic markers, along with information technology systems to monitor asthma control hold some promise in identifying gaps in disease management. These advances should prompt the evolution of new strategies and new treatments to further reduce disease burden. It now becomes imperative to continue a focus on ways to further reduce the burden of asthma and prevent its onset.",,Stanley J Szefler

Despite national treatment recommendations and the availability of effective controller medications, asthma morbidity remains pervasive and currently represents a considerable socioeconomic burden. Asthma may be intermittent or persistent; persistent asthma may be mild, moderate, or severe. Many factors influence asthma severity, both on a short-term basis and over time. In individual patients, asthma severity may fluctuate because of physiologic, environmental, socioeconomic, or behavioral factors. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are safe and well tolerated, and are the preferred long-term treatment for controlling persistent asthma of all severities in adults and children. Awareness of episodic changes in asthma severity, with subsequent tailored adjustment in guideline-based ICS therapy, should enable optimal control of asthma with minimal medication requirements.",,Kevin R Murphy;William E Berger

It is estimated that up to 40% of asthmatic women of childbearing age may experience a cyclical exacerbation of asthmatic symptoms during the perimenstrual period, which is called perimenstrual asthma (PMA). The precise prevalence of this particular phenotype of asthma is difficult to determine due to a lack of explicit diagnostic criteria and appropriate epidemiological surveys. According to one of the best documented hypotheses regarding perimenstrual exacerbations of asthma, the impact of female steroid sex hormones on the function of the respiratory system and inflammations in the bronchi may play a central role in this phenomenon. Although the basic medical approach to PMA is similar to that used in other asthma phenotypes, unconventional methods of ""experimental"" treatment have also been tried. Unfortunately, current knowledge about the pathogenic mechanisms of this phenotype of asthma is incomplete and inconsistent, which justifies the need for further interdisciplinary studies with the participation of specialists in both gynecology and lung diseases.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10354005/,[Round Table: Severe asthma in pediatrics. Concepts and predisposing factors],"Given the clinical and functional characteristics of severe asthma, we will look at the factors that predispose to potentially fatal asthma. They can be divided into three groups: a) factors related to medical care: error of diagnosis of asthma and severity, deficiencies in the treatment prescribed, lack of control of treatment, frequent changes of doctor, lack of diagnostic tools; b) factors related to the patient and the environment: denial of the disease, failure to comply with or abandonment of treatment, underrating the severity of attacks, age (adolescence), coexistence of psychiatric disorder (depression); c) disease-dependent factors: admissions to hospital, need for mechanical ventilation on occasion, increase of symptoms during the last year, need for substantial medication. Adolescence is a critical stage of life in asthma. It implicitly involves a number of risk factors, all of which are age-dependent: refusal to acknowledge the illness, resistance to treatment (in particular as regards continuity and frequency of doses) lack of self-esteem, lack of confidence in the doctor, the beginning of the smoking habit. Another key factor is the coexistence of depression and asthma. In addition to the low self-esteem due to the affective disorder (which will in itself influence any form of treatment) depression is associated with a higher incidence of illnesses --especially infectious illnesses-- which can also aggravate asthma. Anxiety and stressful circumstances in general are factors that negatively affect the illness. Factors that influence the evolution of the illness are the following: factors that influence asthma severity: patient-dependent, sensitivization-dependent, environment-dependent, treatment-dependent, illness-dependent, dependent on respiratory function exploration.",,J I Sierra Martínez

In many cases, such therapy results in near complete control of asthma symptoms, restoration of normal lung physiology, and elimination of exacerbations. In fact, such improvement is frequent enough that therapeutic responsiveness to asthma treatments was thought to be nearly universal. However, it is not uncommon for patients to return with incomplete, or even trivial improvement in these clinical metrics of control (Langmack and Martin Curr Opin Pulm Med 16:13-18, 2010).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10422741/,The epidemiology of childhood asthma,"Variability is the hallmark of childhood asthma. Conceptually defined as variable airflow obstruction, asthma affects individual children through a variety of clinical manifestations. Particular controversy surrounds the nature of wheezing in early infancy and its relationship to atopic asthma of later onset. Asthma prognosis is also highly variable and only to a limited extent predictable by clinical indicators in early childhood. Long-term follow-up studies suggest a complex pattern of remission and relapse as wheezy children are followed through adolescence into adult life. Similarly, the population burden of asthma is highly variable, both over time and between countries. The balance of evidence worldwide suggests a modest but sustained increase in the prevalence of asthma symptoms over the past three decades. Superimposed on this have been larger changes in diagnostic fashion and use of health services for childhood asthma in many countries. There is substantial international variation in the prevalence of asthma symptoms, and marked urban-rural differences have been reported from several African countries.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11772152/,Choosing therapy for childhood asthma,"Inhaled corticosteroids remain the primary long-term treatment for controlling childhood asthma. Sodium cromoglycate (cromolyn sodium) and nedocromil sodium are both well tolerated, but usually less effective, alternatives to corticosteroids. Long-acting beta(2)-agonists (beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists) may be useful adjuncts in patients already receiving inhaled corticosteroids who require frequent use of short-acting bronchodilators or experience nocturnal exacerbations (i.e. overall asthma control suboptimal). Theophylline has bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory effects and may also be used as an adjunct to inhaled corticosteroids. Leukotriene receptor antagonists are now an alternative as monotherapy in young children with mild persistent asthma, or as adjunctive therapy with inhaled corticosteroids as well. Short-acting inhaled beta(2)-agonists or other short-acting bronchodilators should be used as needed for acute episodes. For inhaled delivery, metered-dose inhalers with spacer devices (holding chambers) may be used as the delivery system in many patients, but the choice of inhalation method must be individualised, based largely on patient acceptance and compliance. Systemic corticosteroids may be used to gain prompt control when initiating long-term therapy in patients with severe, persistent asthma that does not respond to inhaled medication or in patients who are unable to take inhaled medication. The anti-immunoglobulin E antibody, omalizumab, is a novel therapy that attacks a fundamental immunopathological process of asthma and has shown promising results in several clinical trials.",,R F Lemanske Jr

It can be demonstrated by bronchial provocation tests with pharmacological or physical stimuli. The measured level of responsiveness to these agents is considered to reflect the lability of the airways and the severity of the disease. Acute exposure to allergen causes an increase of airway responsiveness. The significant correlation between the allergen-induced increase in hyperresponsiveness and the severity of the late asthmatic reaction suggests the same underlying mechanisms that include an influx of inflammatory cells in the airways occurring during late phase of response to allergens. Marked inflammation with infiltration of eosinophils and disruption of airway epithelium has been also described on autopsies of patients who died of acute asthma but also on bronchial biopsies of subjects with mild asthma.

The determinants of this unfavourable prognosis of asthma are: long duration of exposure before the onset of asthma; long duration of symptoms before diagnosis; baseline airway obstruction; dual response after specific challenge test; and the persistence of markers of airway inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and bronchial biopsy. The relevance of immunological markers in the outcome of occupational asthma has not yet been assessed. Further occupational exposure in sensitized subjects leads to persistence and sometimes to progressive deterioration of asthma, irrespective of the reduction of exposure to the specific sensitizer, and only the use of particular protective devices effectively prevents the progression of the disease. A long-term follow-up study of toluene diisocyanate (TDI)-induced asthma showed that the improvement in bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine occurred in a small percentage of subjects and only a long time after work cessation.

Long-standing asthma induces airway remodeling, leading to intractable asthma. The number of patients with asthma has increased; however, the number of patients who die of asthma has decreased (1.2 per 100,000 patients in 2015). The goal of asthma treatment is to enable patients with asthma to attain normal pulmonary function and lead a normal life, without any symptoms.

This chapter reviews the mechanistic and epidemiological evidence concerning air pollution and asthma and examines the hypothesis that trends in asthma could be explained by air pollution. It is concluded that existing evidence is not sufficient to link air pollution with the initiation of asthma in healthy subjects. Although there is better evidence that air pollution can provoke or aggravate asthma, it probably plays a minor role at a public health level, in comparison with other factors. It is therefore unlikely that trends in asthma could be explained by air pollution. Furthermore, correlations between some air pollutants and asthma over time are not consistent with the hypothesis.

In vitro studies of molecular mechanisms have focused on the role of reactive oxygen species generated directly and indirectly by the exposure to DEP. Antioxidants effectively reduce the allergic inflammatory effects induced by DEP both in vitro and in vivo. On the other hand, Nrf2 is a transcription factor essential for the inducible and/or constitutive expression of phase II and antioxidant enzymes. Disruption of Nrf2 enhances susceptibility to airway inflammatory responses and exacerbation of allergic inflammation induced by DEP in mice.

Of the 2921 records found, we identified 12 studies comparing early- and late-onset current asthma in adults. Age 12 was most commonly used to delineate the two age-of-onset phenotypes. Adults with early-onset current asthma were more likely to be atopic and had a higher frequency of asthma attacks, whereas adults with late-onset disease were more likely to be female, smokers and had greater levels of spirometrically defined fixed airflow obstruction. The prevalence of severe asthma was similar in both groups, and, in general, there were few phenotypic differences between severe asthmatics regardless of age of onset. Findings for several key characteristics, including lung function, were inconsistent between studies. Overall, there appears to be distinctive phenotypic differences with age of asthma onset. Although early-onset adult asthma is likely more attributable to atopy and potentially genetic factors, late-onset adult asthma appears to be more related to environmental risk factors, and so may be better targeted by preventive strategies.

In airway remodeling, various cytokines have been found to be involved and among them, we believe IGF-I is one of most important factors, which could be a target of asthma treatment.

However, the concept that asthma can affect older individuals has been largely denied in the past. In clinical practice, asthma that occurs in the most advanced ages is often diagnosed as COPD, thus leading to undertreatment or improper treatment. The heterogeneity of clinical and functional presentation of geriatric asthma, including the partial loss of reversibility and of the allergic component, contributes to this misconception. A large body of evidence has accumulated demonstrating that the prevalence of asthma in the most advanced ages is similar to that in younger ages. The frequent coexistence of comorbid conditions in older patients compared to younger asthmatics, together with age-associated changes of the human lung, may render the management of asthma a complicated task.

It is one of the most common chronic disorders affecting approximately 4-5 % of adults and more than 10 % of children in Germany. This turns asthma into one of the most prevalent chronic disorders. Over the last century ideas about its pathogenesis have changed many times. While around one hundred years ago asthma was often considered a neurotic disease, changes in airway smooth muscle, mast cell accumulation and activation or specific mediators such as platelet-activating factor have since been incriminated in its pathogenesis. Eosinophils, cytokines and T-lymphocytes were favourites some time later. Nowadays, - and this is unlikely to be the end of the story - asthma is considered as a complex disorder of the adaptive immune system. Therapeutic approaches have changed dramatically, too. While until about 30 years ago asthma was still considered a Smooth muscle disorder, recurrent attacks of asthma which required frequent, mostly nocturnal interventions, status asthmaticus, or the necessity of mechanical, invasive ventilation have markedly decreased. In view of the asthma epidemic in recent years, this development suggests that current treatments are at least partially effective. In spite of this patients with asthma are often only moderately well controlled with considerable morbidity from the disease as well as its treatment. Thus, despite recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, asthma is still not a trivial disease and future attempts at improving the care of those affected are warranted. The developments of the past 100 years as well as a careful look into the future are presented in this review.",,J C Virchow

Clinical definitions and classifications for ACOS vary widely, which impacts our understanding of prevalence, diagnosis and treatment of the condition. This literature review was therefore conducted to characterize the prevalence of ACOS and the effect of different disease definitions on these estimates, as this has not previously been explored. From an analysis of English language literature published from 2000 to 2014, the estimated prevalence of ACOS ranges from 12.1% to 55.2% among patients with COPD and 13.3%-61.0% among patients with asthma alone. This variability is linked to differences in COPD and asthma diagnostic criteria, disease ascertainment methods (spirometry-based versus clinical or symptom-based diagnoses and claims data), and population characteristics including age, gender and smoking. Understanding the reasons for differences in prevalence estimates of ACOS across the literature may help guide decision making on the most appropriate criteria for defining ACOS and aid investigators in designing future ACOS clinical studies aimed at effective treatment.",Asthma; Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,Keele E Wurst;Kaitlin Kelly-Reif;Greta A Bushnell;Steven Pascoe;Neil Barnes

An association between asthma and raised gaseous nitric oxide in the exhaled breath was first reported in 1993. In the absence of an objective test for diagnosing and monitoring asthma, a vigorous research effort has subsequently sought to determine the nature of the relationship between exhaled nitric oxide (ENO) and asthma and to determine the clinical utility of ENO measurements in asthmatics. Many methodological issues relating to ENO measurements have also been addressed. The evidence indicates that ENO originates from a number of sources and the ""excess"" ENO in asthmatics is mostly derived from the lower respiratory epithelium where ENO probably reflects eosinophilic airway inflammation. Clinical studies have revealed that ENO may be useful in the diagnosis of atopic asthma but not non-atopic asthma. Longitudinal measurements of ENO have been found to correlate with asthma symptoms, including relapse of symptoms after cessation of corticosteroids treatment. In summary, over a relatively short time ENO has become recognised as a useful objective tool for diagnosing and monitoring asthma. More clinical studies will be required in order for ENO to become fully established in the diagnosis and management of asthma.",,Steve Turner

The median proportion of adult cases of asthma attributable to occupational exposure is between 10% and 15%. The population attributable fraction appears to be similar in industrialised and developing countries characterised by rapid industrialisation (13-15%), but lower in less industrialised developing countries (6%). The high-risk occupations and industries associated with the development of occupational asthma vary depending on the dominant industrial sectors in a particular country. High-risk exposure to cleaning agents and pesticide exposure in developing countries appear to be as important as exposure to isocyanates, cereal flour/grain dust, welding fumes, wood dust and, more recently, hairdressing chemicals, commonly reported in industrialised countries. The reported mean annual incidence of occupational asthma in developing countries is less than 2 per 100 000 population, compared to very high rates of up to 18/100 000 in Scandinavian countries. While occupational asthma remains under-recognised, especially in developing countries, it remains poorly diagnosed and managed and inadequately compensated worldwide.

In recent years, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying allergic asthma has grown, and this has resulted in complex paradigms to define the immunobiology of the disorder. These paradigms conceive of asthma as a disorder with complex genetic and environmental interactions that affect the developing immune system and ultimately result in the episodic release of procontractile mediators, including leukotrienes and prostaglandins, causing susceptible individuals to wheeze. Genetic studies seek to advance our knowledge by identifying the differences in our genetic make-up that cause us to be susceptible.

In particular, for patients with bronchial asthma, we need to care for perioperative complications because it is well known that these patients frequently have respiratory complications after surgery, and they may have bronchial spasms during surgery. If we can get good control of their bronchial asthma, we can usually perform surgery for these patients without limitations. For safe postoperative care, it is desirable that these patients have stable asthma conditions that are well-controlled before surgery, as thoracic surgery requires intrabronchial intubation for anesthesia and sometimes bronchial resection. These stimulations to the bronchus do not provide for good conditions because of the risk of bronchial spasm. Therefore, we should use the same agents that are used to control bronchial asthma if it is already well controlled. If it is not, we have to administer a β₂ stimulator, aminophylline, or steroidal agents for good control. Isoflurane or sevoflurane are effective for the safe control of anesthesia during surgery, and we should use a β₂ stimulator, with or without inhalation, or steroidal agents after surgery.

Records from recipients of asthma drugs who lacked an asthma diagnosis showed that 79% did not have asthma. Automated medical and pharmacy records from an HMO were relatively accurate when used to identify individuals with asthma. Similarly, most asthma drug recipients who lacked a coded diagnosis of asthma did not have asthma. However, conventional full-text records usually do not contain sufficient information to assess asthma severity, limiting the utility of such records for research and quality improvement.",,J G Donahue;S T Weiss;M A Goetsch;J M Livingston;D K Greineder;R Platt
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11980466/,Natural history of asthma in children,"Asthma is a syndrome of reversible bronchial obstruction in hyperresponsive airways mediated by allergy or other trigger factors. Allergic disease represents true asthma while transient wheezing may be caused by factors such as viral infection, aspiration, prematurity and neonatal lung damage and is likely to outgrow within few years. Personal or family history of atopy, increased serum IgE and positive skin tests may suggest allergic asthma, which persists throughout life irrespective of presence or absence of symptoms. Onset of age beyond 2 years, severity, persistence or recurrence of symptoms beyond 6 years of age, airway hyperresponsiveness and abnormal lung function even in absence of symptoms, strong family history especially in the mother, exposure to allergens, parental smoking and delay in starting appropriate therapy are some of high risk factors in persistence of asthma in adult life. As outcome of asthma depend upon multiple variable factors, it is difficult to predict natural history of asthma in an individual child.",,Y K Amdekar

His task then was even more complex than ours is today. He not only worked alone in a medical void, providing care for over 200 patients with chronic asthma, but he also suffered from the same disease. But not only is asthma not an uncommon disease, but it is one of the direst suffering; the horrors of the asthmatic paroxysm far exceed any acute bodily pain; the sense of impending suffocation, the agonizing struggle for the breath of life, are so terrible, that they cannot even be witnessed without sharing in the sufferer's distress. With a face expressive of the intensest anxiety, unable to move, speak, or even make signs, the chest distended and fixed, the head throne back between the elevated shoulders, the muscles of respiration ridged and tightened like cords, and tugging and straining for every breath that is drawn, the surface pallid or livid, cold and sweating--such are signs by which this dreadful suffering manifests itself. And, even in the intervals of health the asthmatic's sufferings do not cease; he seems well, he goes about like his fellows and among them, but he knows that he is altogether different from them; he bears about his disease within him wherever he goes; he knows he is struck; he is conscious that he is not sound--he cannot be warranted; he is not certain of a days, perhaps not of an hours health; he only knows that a certain percentage of his future life must be dedicated to suffering; he cannot make an engagement except with a proviso, and from any of the occupations of life he is cut-off; the recreations, the enjoyments, the indulgences of others are not for him; his usefulness is crippled, his life is marred; and if he knows anything of the nature of his complaint he knows that his sufferings may terminate in a closing scene worse only than the present.

Some of the well-known factors--respiratory tract infections, exposure to cigarette smoke, specific antigens and regular application of prophylactic treatment--which could cause or complicate asthma were studied in groups of white and coloured patients. More respiratory tract infections occurred in coloured patients and they were more exposed to their own and secondary cigarette smoke. Pets and grass pollen allergenicity was more common among whites while allergy to Aspergillus fumigatus and Ascaris lumbricoides was found more frequently among coloured patients. Both white and coloured patients had problems with regular prophylactic control of their symptoms with inhaled beta-stimulants, even after an average of two education sessions per patient, but this was of greater dimension for the coloured (60%) than the white group (27%) (P less than 0.001).

Among these asthma seems most common and important clinically. Reflux not only may trigger and aggravate an episode of airway obstruction but also may contribute to nocturnal symptoms. Both clinical and experimental observations suggest that the pathogenetic mechanism may be a vagal reflux following stimulation of lower esophageal receptors and/or microaspiration of gastric acid into the trachea. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical history of asthma and symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, but in some cases, diagnostic tests such as 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring may be necessary. General measures to avoid reflux and an H2-receptor antagonist together with supportive gastric medications may be the standard treatment. If symptoms persist, proton pump inhibitor may be helpful.

The number of students included in both studied groups was 9108. This study is part of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC), phase III. The response rate was 84% for urban schoolchildren compared with 68% among Bedouin schoolchildren. There was no statistical significance in prevalence of asthma diagnosed by a physician between the Amman city group and Bedouins (8.8% versus 9.5%). Wheeze induced by exercise and night cough was significantly common in schoolchildren aged 13-14 years compared with primary schoolchildren (18.5 and 25.3% versus 11.1 and 22.6%; p < 0.001). Wheezing ever and sleep disturbances were significantly more common in male subjects (27.5%, p < 0.01, and 12.2%, p < 0.001, respectively). Primary schoolchildren aged 6-7 years had significant wheezing ever (27.2%) compared with older children (25.1%; p < 0.05).

In conclusion, this study shows that asthma is moderately common in Jordan. There was no difference in prevalence of asthma diagnosed by a physician between an urbanized region and Bedouins having low socioeconomic status.

Current understanding of the mechanisms by which many agents cause occupational asthma is limited, especially for low-molecular-weight sensitizers and irritants. The diagnosis of occupational asthma is generally established on the basis of a suggestive history of a temporal association between exposure and the onset of symptoms and objective evidence that these symptoms are related to airflow limitation. Early diagnosis, elimination of exposure to the responsible agent, and early use of inhaled steroids may play important roles in the prevention of long-term persistence of asthma. Persistent occupational asthma is often associated with substantial disability and consequent impacts on income and quality of life. Prevention of new cases is the best approach to reducing the burden of asthma attributable to occupational exposures. Future research needs are identified.",,L J Lombardo;J R Balmes

This interaction has highlighted genes important in early life, particularly those that control lung development, such as the Wingless/Integrase-1 (WNT) signalling pathway. Although aberrant WNT signalling is involved with an array of human conditions, it has received little attention within the context of asthma. Yet it is highly relevant, driving events involved with inflammation, airway remodelling, and airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR). In this review, we revisit asthma therapeutics by examining whether WNT signalling is a valid therapeutic target for asthma.",,Tim Koopmans;Reinoud Gosens

Sufficient time--at least a year--must be taken to get to know the patient and to meet the objectives set. The standard asthma therapies should be tested objectively. Severe asthma is the reality of difficult asthma that endures despite a reaffirmed diagnosis, optimal compliance and controlled comorbidities.

Next, using data from an ongoing cohort study (n = 186), we constructed and compared four prediction models which all predict asthma at age 6 yrs, using a fixed set of predictors and four different definitions in turn. We defined an area of clinical indecision (posterior probability between 25% and 60%) and calculated the number of children who remained inside this area. 122 papers yielded 60 different definitions. Prevalence estimates varied between 15.1% and 51.1% depending on the asthma definition used. The percentage of children whose posterior asthma probability was in the area of clinical indecision varied from 14.9% to 65.3%.

These may impair the patient's physical and psychosocial development and quality of life in the context of family, school and occupational life. Continued care of growing children from the start of the disease when they are infants to the point when they assume personal responsibility as adults is one of the major concerns of the pediatrician. This concept requires interdisciplinary cooperation and a large body of personnel which would include training programs, inclusion of family members and in some cases psychosomatic therapy. Given the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases in this age group and their sociopolitical significance it is important to activate preventive potentials in terms of content and structure - by quality assurance - especially to avoid long-term complications.

The most common symptoms are recurrent wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. Objective: The Asthma Insights and Management study gathered information on the burden of asthma in the Gulf region (United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia) and Russia. Methods: This was a cross-sectional, multinational, noninterventional, two-phase study that collected data from patients ages ≥ 12 years, through interviews and a survey questionnaire. Phase 1 consisted of survey questions focused on estimating the asthma prevalence in the community. Phase 2 was designed to assess the level of asthma control, asthma-related perceptions and behaviors, and presentation patterns. Data were summarized by using descriptive analyses. Results: Analysis of data of 711 patients revealed that the prevalence of asthma among patients who lived in the community was 7.9% and that 66% subjectively perceived their asthma as being controlled. However, 97% of the patients' asthma were partially controlled or uncontrolled based on the Global initiative for Asthma control classification. Troubling symptoms were daytime coughing (33.3%) and shortness of breath (20.3%).

The need for further treatment options has stimulated basic and pharmacological research to focus on the immune and inflammatory background of asthma. The new biologic drugs express the considerable advances in the field and besides providing a revolutionary treatment option for severe asthma, contribute themselves to better understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms they address, paving the way to new potential targets.Areas covered: A selective search on PubMed and Medline was performed, including the evidence on immunology of severe asthma published up to May 2019 by focusing on the immunological effects of biologic drugs underlying their clinical outcomes.Expert opinion: The recent pharmacological research in the field of biologics has represented an exceptional opportunity for exploring severe asthma mechanisms. However, some points deserve to be addressed by further investigation. Although in the absence of safety warnings so far, interfering with the immune system may raise some safety concerns, especially in the long-term use. Particularly when interacting with epithelial and innate immunity the selection of candidates probably deserves special caution. Also, whether biologics exert a true disease-modifying effect is not completely clear.

Children were instructed to answer the following questions on the Asthma Report Form each time they experienced an asthma episode: 1) What were you doing; 2) How did you feel; and 3) What did you do to help your breathing? Of the children, 71% experienced at least one asthma episode during the 6 weeks. There were a total of 206 episodes. Physical activity (51%) was the most cited trigger, cough alone or combined with other symptoms (84%) was the predominant symptom, and rescue asthma medication (59%) was identified most often as the intervention used by the children to resolve the asthma episode. Children's self-reports provided valuable information about their asthma episodes. The finding that most of the children experienced at least one asthma episode during the 6-week period underscores the importance of family education on how to handle asthma episodes effectively at home.

According to this classification several types of occupational asthma are associated with the working environment. It is stressed that continuing prophylaxis of inflammation should protect the worker from irreversible airflow obstruction. This is of special interest to the population suffering from occupational asthma.,,V Cvetanov;J Karadzinska-Bislimovska;E Stikova
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27273858/,Asthma in adolescence: Is there any news?,"Asthma is a chronic disease that has a significant impact quality of life, which is particularly important in adolescence. We will discuss aspects of epidemiology, the clinical spectrum, diagnostics, and management of asthma in adolescence. In particular, we will highlight the psychological implications of having asthma during this developmental period. Data published in the past 10 years, since we last reviewed the subject, will be the main focus of this paper. The care of the teenager with asthma should take into account the rapid physical, emotional, cognitive, and social changes that occur during normal adolescence. The diagnostic process may be more difficult since teenagers tend to deny their illness. Thus, both under-diagnosis and under-assessment of asthma severity may lead to under-treatment and potentially avoidable morbidity and even mortality. Conversely, teenagers may be often misdiagnosed as having asthma or their asthma severity may be overestimated leading to inappropriate and sometimes excessive treatment. Educational programs, environmental avoidance measures, proper use of medications along with a skilled approach, and a caring attitude of health providers are all very important for successful management.

Limited knowledge of the mechanisms of these disease subgroups is possibly the greatest obstacle in understanding the causes of asthma and improving treatment and can explain the failure to identify consistent genetic and environmental correlations to asthma. Here we describe a hypothesis whereby the asthma syndrome is divided into distinct disease entities with specific mechanisms, which we have called ""asthma endotypes."" An ""endotype"" is proposed to be a subtype of a condition defined by a distinct pathophysiological mechanism. Criteria for defining asthma endotypes on the basis of their phenotypes and putative pathophysiology are suggested. Using these criteria, we identify several proposed asthma endotypes and propose how these new definitions can be used in clinical study design and drug development to target existing and novel therapies to patients most likely to benefit.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8335861/,How the current understanding of the pathophysiology of asthma influences our approach to therapy,"Asthma can no longer be equated with bronchospasm; instead, we know now that this disease is due to combinations of mucosal edema and inflammation, increased secretions, and muscle contraction. The appreciation of the contribution of these various causes of airflow obstruction and the role that inflammation plays in asthma dictates that we approach treatment using two parallel modalities: (1) symptomatic drugs that act to relieve the airflow obstruction but have no effects on the underlying causes of the disease (e.g., bronchodilators such as beta-adrenergic agonists, theophylline, and anticholinergic compounds) and (2) specific treatment aimed at preventing or reversing the underlying causes responsible for the disease. Four specific treatments are available today: allergen avoidance, immunotherapy, cromolyn sodium, and inhaled corticosteroids. Management of asthma in the 1990s requires that all patients receive specific treatments intended to reduce the disease processes and that symptomatic treatment be used only as necessary.",,M A Kaliner

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20688204/,Long-term studies of the natural history of asthma in childhood,"Segmentation of children with asthma and other wheezy disorders remains the main research challenge today, as it was when described 2 centuries ago. Early childhood wheezy disorders follow different temporal trajectories, probably representing different underlying mechanisms (endophenotypes). Prospective identification of endophenotypes allowing accurate prediction of the clinical course is currently not possible. The variability of the clinical course remains an enigma and difficult to predict. Three of 4 school-aged children with asthma have outgrown disease by midadulthood. The risk of persistence increases with severity, sensitization, smoking, and female sex. Genetic risk variants might help disentangle the heterogeneity of asthma and other wheezy disorders. At early school age, children with asthma have reduced lung function. It is an important and unresolved question whether the airflow limitation associated with asthma already existed at birth or developed along with symptoms. Likewise, the association between the infant's bronchial responsiveness and development of asthma and other wheezy disorders is unclear. Neither primary prevention through manipulation of environmental factors nor secondary prevention through the use of inhaled corticosteroids can effectively halt the long-term disease progression in childhood. In conclusion, the natural history of asthma and the associated airway changes is still poorly understood, and we have not managed to translate findings from long-term studies into a deeper understanding of the underlying endophenotypes or improved disease management. We propose the need for a translational research approach based on long-term clinical studies of birth cohorts with comprehensive and objective assessments of intermediate phenotypes and environmental exposures combined with interdisciplinary basic research and a systems biology approach.",,Hans Bisgaard;Klaus Bønnelykke

Factors of importance for the annual decline of lung function],"The purpose of this study was to describe the relation of various factors of potential importance to the rate of decline in lung function in adults with intrinsic and extrinsic asthma. Of 180 asthmatic patients, 143 (79%) participated in a 10 year follow up examination; 94 patients had intrinsic asthma and 49 extrinsic asthma. Patients with intrinsic asthma had an annual decline in FEV1 of 50 ml, whereas those with extrinsic asthma had a decline of 23 ml; the rate of decline of lung function increased with increasing age in both groups. There was no relation between rate of decline in lung function and number of cigarettes smoked. An inverse relation between initial FEV1 and decline in FEV1 was found for the patients with extrinsic asthma but not for the patients with intrinsic asthma. A high degree of airway variability--that is, reversibility in FEV1--at the time of enrollment was found to be associated with a steeper decline in lung function in patients with intrinsic asthma, whereas increasing degrees of obstruction (decreasing FEV1/VC ratio at enrollment) and need for treatment with corticosteroids were associated with a more pronounced decline in FEV1 in patients with extrinsic asthma. The rate of decline in lung function is greater in patients with intrinsic asthma than in patients with extrinsic asthma; the prognosis for intrinsic and extrinsic asthma is to some extent influenced by different factors, which suggests that the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying intrinsic and extrinsic asthma may differ.",,C S Ulrik;V Backer;A Dirksen

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11764862/,Work-related asthma,"Work-related asthma accounts for at least 10 percent of all cases of adult asthma. Work-related asthma includes work aggravation of preexisting asthma and new-onset asthma induced by occupational exposure. Occupational exposure to very high concentrations of an irritant substance can produce reactive airway dysfunction syndrome, while exposure to allergenic substances can result in allergic occupational asthma. An important step in the diagnosis of work-related asthma is recognition by the physician of the work relatedness of the illness. A thorough history can elucidate the work relation and etiology. Objective tests, including pulmonary function, nonspecific and specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness, serial peak expiratory flow rates, and skin allergies, should be performed to confirm the diagnosis of asthma and demonstrate a work correlation. Treatment for occupational asthma--use of anti-inflammatory medications such as inhaled steroids and bronchodilators--is the same as that for nonoccupational asthma. Prevention is an integral part of good medical management. In patients with work-aggravated or irritant-induced asthma, reduction of exposure to aggravating factors is essential. In patients with allergic occupational asthma, exposure should be eliminated because exposure to even minute concentrations of the offending agent can trigger a potentially fatal allergic reaction.",,S Youakim

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) established a practical system of classification, considering clinical and functional aspects as frequency of diurnal and nocturnal respiratory symptoms and lung function, their combination allows for classifying asthma severity as intermittent and persistent ( mild, moderate and severe). Recently, it has been proposed to classify the asthma according to degree of control: controlled, partly controlled and uncontrolled. The parameters used in this system are: frequency of diurnal and nocturnal respiratory symptoms, activity limitation, use of rescue therapy, determining the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) or peak expiratory flow (PEF) and the exacerbations. The patient's participation on the asthma classification has also been considered through the self application of asthma control questionnaire (ACT). Patients with high risk of death are classified in the group of difficult asthma control (ADC), requiring major and minor criteria to define it; the common denominator is the decontrol of the disease, high dose steroids and appropriate treatment previously established.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19834632/,From asthma severity to control: a shift in clinical practice,"Variability is a characteristic feature of asthma, and the aim of asthma management is to eliminate or minimise disease variability. Controlled asthma shows little or no variability, and is achievable and sustainable in the majority of patients. New international guidelines recommend control-driven management rather than management based on disease severity. Good asthma control is associated with reductions in patients' perception of the asthma burden, reduced healthcare resource utilisation, lower levels of impairment/restriction, normal quality of life, and low risk of exacerbations. Asthma control involves the control of several outcomes. Its assessment should include components relevant to achievement of best possible clinical control and reduction of future risk of adverse outcomes. Focusing on a single or a few outcomes can lead to incorrect control assessment and increased risk of under-treatment. Several validated asthma control assessment tools have been developed to facilitate correct assessment of the level of control in clinical practice. It is hoped that focusing on control will reduce the frequency of sub-optimal treatment in the primary care setting. Further validation of the best way to assess control easily and accurately, and the implementation of control-driven management, are the two most important challenges for the future of asthma management.",,Søren Pedersen

However, asthma attacks remain common. They continue to cause mortality and considerable morbidity, and are a major financial burden to the UK National Health Service (NHS) and the wider community. Asthma attacks have chronic consequences, being associated with loss of lung function and significant psychological morbidity. In this article we argue that addressing daily symptom control is only one aspect of asthma treatment, and that there should be a more explicit focus on reducing the risk of asthma attacks. Management of future risk by general practitioners is already central to other conditions such as ischaemic heart disease and chronic renal impairment. We therefore propose a revised approach that separately considers the related domains of daily control and future risk of asthma attack. We believe this approach will have advantages over the current 'stepwise' approach to asthma management. It should encourage individualised treatment, including non-pharmacological measures, and thus may lead to more efficacious and less harmful management strategies. We speculate that this type of approach has the potential to reduce morbidity and healthcare costs related to asthma attacks.",,John D Blakey;Kerry Woolnough;Jodie Fellows;Samantha Walker;Mike Thomas;Ian D Pavord

The point of view of an expert],"Occupational asthma remains a difficult problem for physicians and for experts. The prevalence of occupational asthma is underestimated and depends on industrial agent and conditions of work. Diagnosis is made based on detailed description of the patient's work environment, on skin and serological tests, and on lung function tests including non-specific bronchial provocation tests. Rhinomanometry, and peak flow rate measurements may also be useful. Bronchial provocation tests should be performed by experienced staff in a hospital setting with facilities for resuscitation. The prognosis of occupational asthma is variable: --some patients with short and limited exposure may fully recover if their disease is early recognized and appropriate measures are taken; --however, many patients do not recover completely after removal of the responsible agents. Clinical symptoms and bronchial hyperreactivity persist and respiratory insufficiency may develop. The patterns of occupational asthma are changing rapidly, in parallel with industrial evolution: nowadays, bakers's asthma is less frequent than it used to be. Asthma triggered by wood dust and in particular western red cedar (which is exported all over the world) is increasingly recognized. Isocyanates and, in particular toluene isocyanate, are widely used in plastics and paints. Preventive measures have succeeded in decreasing the incidence of asthma caused by exposure to isocyanates. Computer industry has recently developed in many countries. It requires the use of numerous hazardous and highly toxic materials that are potentially responsible for occupational asthma; attention should be given to respiratory diseases especially in industrializing countries (such as Eastern Asian countries). Preventive measures include safety rules, replacement of harmful materials by less toxic agents and detection of susceptible workers.

The reported prevalence of ever having asthma increased among 6- to 11-year-old children between the first (1971 to 1974) and second (1976 to 1980) National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (4.8% to 7.6%, P less than .01). The epidemiology of asthma among children and adolescents 3 to 17 years of age in the United States was examined using data collected in the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In this paper, asthma is defined as current disease diagnosed by a physician and/or frequent trouble with wheezing during the past 12 months, not counting colds or the flu. Asthma was reported for 6.7% of youths overall and was higher in black than white children (9.4% v 6.2%, P less than .01), boys than girls (7.8% v 5.5%, P less than .01), and urban than rural areas (7.1% v 5.7%, P less than .05). Asthmatic children had a higher prevalence of other allergies (42.6% v 13.2%, P less than .01) and of allergen skin test reactivity (44.5% v 20.7%, P less than .01) than nonasthmatic children.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12428539/,Genetics of asthma,"As is becoming increasingly apparent, both atopy and asthma (however they are clinically defined) are a diverse group of related conditions, which are similarly disparate in their origins. Despite this, genetic factors are clearly operational. Speaking to their relatedness, linkages have been found between similar chromosomal sites for both atopy and asthma. Speaking to their divergence, there are also reports of the same phenotypes displaying linkage to different chromosomal areas. The likely explanation for this is that both the atopy and asthma phenotypes are polygenetic, requiring that multiple genes (some of them common to both) be expressed. For example, it may be that three genes, such as ""a,"" ""b,"" and ""c,"" are involved in the development of skin test reactivity. Having only two of these genes, such as ""a"" and ""b"" or ""b"" and ""c,"" alone does not result in the development of the defined phenotype of skin test reactivity. At the same time, it may be that to develop asthma one also needs three genes, such as ""c"", ""d,"" and ""e."" One gene ""c"" involved in atopy inflammation is needed for both asthma and skin test reactivity. Genes ""a"" and ""b"" are also needed to be present for skin test reactivity, and a different set of genes, ""d"" and ""e,"" are needed for asthma to develop. These genes ""a"" and ""b"" may be needed to localize the process in the skin and ""d"" and ""e"" to localize the process in the lung (Fig. 1). In addition to having the genetic predisposition for atopy and its associated conditions, environmental interactions are involved. Environmental conditions may be the initiating trigger and cause a shift in the balance between the protection and susceptibility of getting the clinical picture. In summary, atopy and asthma seem to be related conditions, involving both environmental and genetic factors, most likely consisting of multiple genes, which may interact with each other and the environment. A deeper [figure: see text] understanding of these genetic bases and the roles that environmental factors play in the development and manifestations of these conditions will provide better methods of diagnosis and treatment.",,Jacob Bryan Blumenthal;Malcolm N Blumenthal

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the interest of a group of asthmatic patients in education on asthma and to point out the asthma-related topics considered particularly worth discussing. The study was conducted before starting the educational programme. Sixty adult patients with mild-to-moderate asthma were asked to complete a questionnaire, including a group of 14 questions aimed at evaluating the level of patients' interest in various asthma-related topics, one question regarding patients' willingness to attend a small-group educational course on asthma, and a further question asking patients to suggest topics of particular interest for discussion. For each of the first 14 questions, patients indicated their level of interest according to a score ranging 1-3. The sum of the scores obtained for each topic (partial score) and the sum of partial scores (total score) were calculated and classified into three classes of interest (I: low, II: medium; III: high), and the distribution of patients into the three classes was analysed (chi-squared test).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,G Moscato;R Niniano;A Corsico;L Cretti;M C Colli;L Perfetti;P Bianchi

The summary results were expressed as meta-odds ratios (ORs) for binary endpoints such as presence of asthma, and meta-differences for continuous endpoints such as changes in post-exercise pulmonary function tests (PFTs). All summary measures of effect were calculated using random effects models accompanied by a corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) and a test for heterogeneity. In the analysis comparing frequency of asthma among elite swimmers to that among other athletes (Group I), meta-ORs ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 with all 95% CIs excluding 1.0. The corresponding meta-ORs reflecting the association between asthma and swimming pool use during childhood (Group II) were in the 0.63-0.82 range and were not statistically significant. In comparison to swimming, running and/or cycling was associated with a statistically significant four-to six-fold increase in exercise induced bronchospasm. Although asthma is more commonly found among elite swimmers than among other high-level athletes, it is premature to draw conclusions about the causal link between swimming and asthma because most studies available to date used cross-sectional design, because the association is not confirmed among non-competitive swimmers, and because asthmatics may be more likely to select swimming as the activity of choice because of their condition.",,Michael Goodman;Sean Hays

Heterogeneity makes life interesting, but leads to inter-individual variation in disease susceptibility and response to therapy. One major health challenge is to develop ""personalised medicine""; therapeutic interventions tailored to an individual to ensure optimal treatment of disease. Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with several different phenotypes triggered by multiple gene-environment interactions. Inhaled corticosteroids and β2-agonists have been the mainstay asthma therapies for 30 years, but they are not effective in all patients, while high costs and side-effects also drive the need for better targeted treatment of asthma. Pharmacogenetics is the study of variations in the genetic code for proteins in signaling pathways targeted by pharmacological therapies. Biomarkers are biological markers obtained from patients that can aid in asthma diagnosis, prediction of treatment response, and monitoring of disease control. This review presents a broad discussion of the use of genetic profiling and biomarkers to better diagnose, monitor, and tailor the treatment of asthmatics.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1762621/,The role of atopy in asthma,"Allergy plays an important role in chronic asthma. Aeroallergens, both indoor and outdoor, provide a constant source of bronchial inflammation that increases bronchial hyperreactivity. This increased reactivity lowers the threshold of response to nonspecific triggers of asthma flares such as viral infections, pollutants, and cold air. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease in much the same way that the rheumatic diseases are. In that respect, therapy should be directed at reducing inflammation, as it is in the rheumatic diseases. Along these lines, newer approaches to asthma therapy should emphasize steroids as first-line treatment. In this way, therapy is targeted against the underlying inflammation that causes the bronchial obstruction, rather than treating with bronchodilators such as theophylline and B agonists. The effect of such continuous antiinflammatory therapy is decreased airway hyperresponsiveness, which has obvious clinical benefit.",,K Sperber

Because most cases of asthma are managed by primary care physicians, we intended to explore the referral practices of pediatricians managing childhood asthma. This study was designed to identify important considerations by pediatricians while referring a child to an asthma specialist. An electronic survey was sent to 1200 graduated pediatricians enlisted in the Michigan Chapter, American Academy of Pediatrics directory. The questions explored asthma disease characteristics, physician preferences when referring children with asthma, and reasons and barriers for asthma consultations. All responses were collected anonymously. We received 240/1200 (20%) questionnaires. The majority of pediatricians considered referral to a specialist if a child had severe persistent asthma (201/236 [85.2%]) or had a single life-threatening asthma event (188/229 [82.1%]). The top two likely reasons of referral included poor asthma control (200/224 [89.3%]) and unclear diagnosis (139/224 [62.1%]). We found 74/219 (33.8%) preferred consultation to a pediatric pulmonologist when compared with 93/219 (42.5%) allergists. We found the minority of pediatricians ""always"" recommended referral to a specialist for the following reasons: allergy skin testing (30/222 [13.5%]), possible allergen immunotherapy (54/223 [24.2%]), and spirometry (26/221 [11.8%]). The major barrier for childhood asthma specialist consultations was issues with medical insurance coverage (137/205 [66.8%]).

This method was developed to direct a hierarchy of asthma therapy based on the patient's severity of disease. However, this severity classification has not been validated and has a number of limitations; in particular, it is challenging for physicians to apply reliably. Moreover, it does not allow asthma control to be assessed after the initiation of treatment, even though symptom control is a key objective of the treatment guidelines. A number of tools have been evaluated to provide longitudinal information on asthma control, and some of these have been validated. Clinically relevant measures of inflammation, such as eosinophilic airway inflammation, may also be helpful in classifying asthma and in guiding the use of antiinflammatory therapy. This may be a particularly useful approach in patients who are asymptomatic but have poor lung function, by permitting physicians to determine whether inflammatory processes are active, thus requiring ICS therapy. In the clinical setting, easy-to-use tools are needed to enable longitudinal assessments of symptom control and (ideally) disease progression.",,LeRoy M Graham

An increased prevalence of psychopathology has been shown repeatedly to occur in severely asthmatic children, but little evidence exists to suggest that this is true for children with mild asthma. A major problem in interpreting the psychological literature addressing asthma has been the absence of studies of children with specified subtypes of the disease and the analysis of heterogeneous samples including children with a wide range of ages and poorly defined disease characteristics. Depression and anxiety disorders occur at a greater prevalence in severely asthmatic children and may be exacerbated by antiasthmatic medications. Vocal cord dysfunction may be misdiagnosed as asthma and is suggested to be associated with an increased risk of psychiatric disturbance. The presence of depressive illness in very severe asthmatic patients is associated with greater asthma mortality and requires intervention. Treatment considerations include the need for a high level of suspicion for noncompliance in patients who are nonresponsive to antiasthmatic medications, judicious use of antidepressant medication, referral of children with co-occurring psychiatric symptoms for psychiatric assessment and management, and consideration of early intervention strategies to minimize the initial expression of asthmatic symptoms.",,D A Mrazek

This study, therefore, adopts the concept analysis proposed by Walker & Avant, by searching seven health-related databases via systematic review methodology. From the results of the concept analysis it can be concluded that there are three definitive features of self-management among asthmatic children: 1) the learning and performance process factors determined reciprocally by cognition, physiology, behavior, and environment, 2) the prevention and management of sudden asthma attacks, 3) the normalization of the patient's life with proper control of the asthmatic condition and a reduction of asthma attacks.

This study was designed to detect risk factors associated with persistent airflow limitation in nonsmoking adult patients with severe asthma. A total of 68 adults with severe asthma were recruited and followed prospectively for four to six weeks during the stable phase of disease. For all patients, at every visit spirometry with reversibility test was performed. Based on the results, patients were stratified into group 1 (reversible obstruction) or group 2 (PAO). In both cohorts, associations of postbronchodilatator forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity ratio (FEV1/FVC) with patients' age, gender, asthma duration, history of atopy and allergy, family history, medications, frequency of previous exacerbations, infections, hospitalizations, and artificial ventilation due to the asthma attack-related respiratory failure were investigated. Using a univariate logistic regression analysis, we have shown that older age, more than six exacerbations per year, artificial ventilation in the past, at least one hospitalization per year, the presence of atopic dermatitis, and exposure to domestic visible mold were all independent risk factors of PAO. Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that especially those with domestic exposure to visible molds, with very frequent exacerbations and with at least one hospitalization throughout the last year, were at risk for developing PAO. Domestic exposure to molds, hospitalization during the last year, and very frequent exacerbations were associated with PAO in patients with severe asthma.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11544449/,Occupational asthma,"The workplace can be responsible for approximately one in 10 cases of adult-onset asthma. Two types of occupational asthma (OA) are distinguished by whether they arise after a latency period that is necessary for acquiring sensitization or as a result of acute exposure to irritant materials (irritant-induced asthma). The pathophysiology of OA with a latency period is similar to that of nonoccupational asthma, whereas the mechanism of irritant-induced asthma is still uncertain. HLA haplotypes and other genetic polymorphisms have been found to be associated with OA. According to various sources of data, the overall frequency of OA has remained stable in the last 10 years, although the frequency of causal agents vary. Registers of causal occupations and agents have been issued on Web sites (eg, www.asmanet.com ). Improved sampling methods have shown that the degree of exposure plays a key role in the onset of the disease, whereas prospective data collected in high-risk workplaces have also identified personal risk factors (eg, atopy, smoking, and rhinoconjunctivitis). A diagnosis of OA should no longer be based on a compatible history only but should be confirmed by means of objective testing. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the worker should be removed from exposure, and satisfactory compensation programs should be offered, the most important being retraining programs with financial compensations because affected workers are generally young. The cost-effectiveness of prevention programs in high-risk workforces should be assessed.",,J L Malo;M Chan-Yeung

Pathologic assessment demonstrates that small airways are inflamed, and the physiology suggests that they narrow and dilate. If after a period of treatment for asthma, all tests including the SBNT are normal, it would be safe to say that the small airways had been treated. However, we need to have some way of imaging the airways to decide whether or not there is abnormality in the small airways and to target the drugs that we are using to treat them.

Recently, interest has increased in the assessment of pH and airway oxidative stress markers. Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and quantification of biomarkers in breath samples can potentially indicate lung disease activity and help in the study of airway inflammation, and asthma severity. Levels of oxidative stress markers in the EBC have been systematically evaluated in children with asthma; however, there is no such systematic review conducted for adult asthma. A systematic review of oxidative stress markers measured in EBC of adult asthma was conducted, and studies were identified by searching MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases. Sixteen papers met the inclusion criteria. Concentrations of exhaled hydrogen ions, nitric oxide products, hydrogen peroxide and 8-isoprostanes were generally elevated and related to lower lung function tests in adults with asthma compared to healthy subjects. Assessment of EBC markers may be a noninvasive approach to evaluate airway inflammation, exacerbations, and disease severity of asthma, and to monitor the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory treatment regimens. Longitudinal studies, using standardized analytical techniques for EBC collection, are required to establish reference values for the interpretation of EBC markers in the context of asthma.",asthma; exhaled breath condensate; oxidative stress; pH; reactive oxygen species.,F M Aldakheel;P S Thomas;J E Bourke;M C Matheson;S C Dharmage;A J Lowe

The guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to pharmacologic treatment, starting with aggressive therapy to achieve control and followed by a ""step down"" to the minimal therapy that will maintain control. Quick relief of symptoms can be achieved preferentially by the use of short-acting beta2 agonists. Medications for long-term control should be considered for use in children with persistent symptoms.

This implies that tasks will have to be divided across several disciplines. An orderly way to do this does not seem to have been suggested in the literature. In this paper a systematic technique is presented to divide educational tasks across disciplines. The basic idea of this method is that one should link up as far as possible with existing task conceptions and knowledge of the disciplines involved. The general description of the technique will be followed by a piece of research in which the technique is applied to protocol development for parents of asthmatic children (0-4 years). The protocol aims at allocating specific asthma education tasks to community nurses, general practitioners, asthma nurses and doctors working at child health centers in the Netherlands. This paper focuses mainly on results for community nurses. Three criteria were considered in assigning tasks to the different careproviders: whether the discipline in question claimed a certain task; whether the other three disciplines agreed with the claim, and whether the discipline in question had appropriate and sufficient knowledge about asthma to perform the task correctly. Community nurses did claim several tasks in asthma care, but knowledge did not always seem to be sufficient. Additional results indicated that nurses who had taken a refresher course did have a higher knowledge level than nurses who had not taken such a course.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7551208/,What is asthma? An update on the mechanisms,"Asthma is currently best described by the presence of characteristic symptoms and by variable airways narrowing and airways hyperresponsiveness to a variety of inhaled bronchoconstricting stimuli. For more than 100 years, asthma has also been known to be an inflammatory disease of the airways. More recently, the importance of airways inflammation in the pathogenesis of asthma, ranging in severity from mild to severe, or in transient asthma after exposure to an inflammatory stimulus, has been recognized. Airways inflammation can be defined as the presence of activated inflammatory cells in the airways. Many studies have now demonstrated the presence of activated eosinophils and of mast cells in the airways lumen and airways wall of patients with asthma, even those with mild disease. The presence and survival of these inflammatory cells may be promoted by the presence of increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as GM-CSF, in asthmatic airways. These cells have the capacity to release potent bronchoconstricting mediators, such as the cysteinyl leukotrienes, which are responsible, at least in part, for airways narrowing in asthma and for allergen-, exercise- and aspirin-induced asthma. Other cells, such as a subset of T-lymphocytes (Th2), may also be important in maintaining the inflammatory cascade. Airways structural changes caused by persisting inflammation, such as airways epithelial damage, or altered smooth muscle function or volume are likely to be important in the pathogenesis of stable, long-standing airways hyperresponsiveness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,P M O'Byrne

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9653510/,Emotionally triggered asthma: a review of research literature and some hypotheses for self-regulation therapies,"Asthma is a common disease whose morbidity and mortality are rapidly increasing. Panic disorder is common in asthma. Panic, other negative emotions, and a passive coping orientation may affect asthma by producing hyperventilation, increased general autonomic lability, a specific pattern of autonomic arousal that may cause bronchoconstriction, and/or detrimental effects on health care behaviors. Generalized panic is a risk factor for increased asthma morbidity. A repressive coping style also appears to be a risk factor for asthma morbidity because it is accompanied by an impaired ability to perceive symptoms, a necessary prerequisite for taking appropriate remediation. Several self-regulation strategies are hypothesized to be useful adjuncts to asthma treatment. Preliminary research has been done on relaxation therapy, EMG biofeedback, biofeedback for improved sensitivity in perceiving respiratory sensations, and biofeedback training for increasing respiratory sinus arrhythmia. It is hypothesized that finger temperature biofeedback also may be a promising treatment method, and that relaxation-oriented methods will have their greatest effect among asthmatics who experience panic symptoms, while improved perceptual sensitivity will be helpful both for patients who panic and those with repressive coping styles.",,P M Lehrer

This distinct clinical syndrome, called aspirin-induced asthma (AIA), is characterized by a typical sequence of symptoms, intense eosinophilic inflammation of nasal and bronchial tissues, combined with overproduction of cysteinyl-leukotrienes (Cys-LTs). At baseline, cys-LT urinary excretion is augmented, and ASA administration leads to its further temporary increase. After ASA challenge, cys-LTs are released into nasal and bronchial secretions and can be collected in the urine. LTC4 synthase, the terminal enzyme for cys-LT production, is markedly overexpressed in eosinophils and mast cells from bronchial biopsy specimens of most patients with AIA. An allelic variant of LTC4 synthase that enhances enzyme transcription is associated with AIA. Avoiding ASA and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs does not prevent progression of the inflammatory disease.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1546825/,Eosinophils in asthma,"Eosinophils, a prominent feature of asthma, are found in increased numbers in the circulation and sputum, usually in relation to the severity of asthma. As a consequence of these clinical observations, investigators now speculate that the eosinophil has a central role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Recent evidence has begun to confirm these speculations. The allergic reaction of the airway to antigen and the development of the late asthmatic reaction have provided a clinical model to study asthma and the contribution of eosinophils to bronchial reactivity. In the late asthmatic reaction, airway eosinophilia occurs. Through a series of independent observations, the following eosinophil-related events have been noted with the development of late asthmatic reactions. With either laboratory or natural exposure to antigen, eosinophilic chemotactic factors are released. Although the sources of eosinophil chemotaxis are multicellular, this is an early step in the attraction of eosinophils to the airway. As this process is initiated, a series of events occurs to cause eosinophils to arrive in the airway and promote obstruction, injury, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. These steps include eosinophil migration through the vascular endothelium, upregulation of eosinophils (characterized by a change in cell density), adhesion of eosinophils to airway epithelium, and release of eosinophil toxic products. This presentation will review some of the eosinophil-dependent factors that can cause asthma. Furthermore, the eosinophil may be a good target for future therapeutic interventions.",,W W Busse;J B Sedgwick

Longitudinal studies suggest that there is a loss of airway function associated with early childhood asthma. Extrapolating from adult disease and the few tissue-based studies of children, this would appear to be related to abnormal postnatal development or remodelling of the airway walls. This appears to be associated with persistent airway inflammation without clinical evidence of airways obstruction. Abnormally thickened airways may be the mechanism underlying both bronchial hyper-responsiveness and fixed loss of respiratory function.

Patients were randomly assigned to a complete (CP; n = 32) or reduced (RP; n = 33) program: the RP group received a reduced education (self-reading of an educational booklet on asthma), while the CP group attended an ""asthma school"", consisting of six lessons based on the same booklet and including educational videotapes. Both programs included peak-flow monitoring and treatment according to international guidelines, and follow-up. The outcome variables (asthma attacks, urgent medical examinations, admission days, working days lost) did not differ significantly between CP and RP.

However, although asthma-related hospital admissions and mortality have decreased, the potential efficacy of treatments is not translating into optimal asthma control and quality of life. This discrepancy may be due to several factors and is complex to analyze. Poor asthma control can be caused by diverse reasons such as the patient's failure to understand how to take the medication, the presence of an untreated, underlying comorbid condition that aggravates the asthma, and the possibility that the patient has a severe form of glucocorticosteroid-insensitive asthma. The present article reviews the situations in which poor asthma control occurs for human-related reasons. These situations can be due to patients themselves and be independent of the disease or can be due to inadequate intervention by health professionals in specific areas and circumstances linked to asthma.

The time and effort spent for treatment can be a great burden for the patient and his family and friends, sometimes causing a handicap in school or profession life. Consequently, the way relatives, friends, and society in general perceive asthma can have an effect on their reaction to the disease. Dominant attitudes in a given social setting create a standard, socially accepted definition of the disease which can play an essential role in asthma-induced morbidity. The link between morbidity, mortality, poverty and quality of health care is a constant feature in epidemiological data on asthma. In areas where pollution is low or access to health care unimpaired, survival curves for asthma patients are similar to those for the non-asthmatic population, demonstrating the role of the social context in asthma-induced mortality. One must however be very prudent in analyzing epidemiological data on asthma since most published work has been conducted in a specific cultural and medical context, often with a health care structure which is quite different from the situation in France. In order to improve the situation of the asthma population in France, two essential questions, ""which patients suffer from their asthma?"" and ""which patients die from their asthma?"" must be answered. Then in order to reach those patients which do not consult, the general population should then be informed. Important targets include better informing general practitioners, facilitating access to health care, training asthma patients, and improving social aid to compensate for the patient's economic incapacity. No matter what improvements in treatment are acquired, in these factors are not taken into consideration, there can be little hope of improving asthma-induced morbidity and mortality.",,A Taytard

We interviewed 95 asthmatic adults, 36 men and 59 women, using a critical incident technique to discover how patients responded to acute asthma symptom episodes. Subjects were interviewed once per month for a total of three interviews. All subjects had physician-diagnosed asthma for a mean of 16.8+/-14.5 years. Eighty-six percent of the sample (n=82) reported delay in seeking medical care for severe asthma symptoms. Seven reasons for delay were identified: uncertainty, disruption, minimization, fear of systemic corticosteroid, previous bad experiences in emergency departments, the need to ""tough it out"" alone, and economic reasons. Seventy-one subjects (86.5%) reported three or more reasons for delay. Thirteen subjects (16%) identified pivotal episodes in which they realized they could die from asthma and as a result, no longer delayed. People with asthma often delay seeking urgent care for acute episodes for a variety of reasons. Some of these reasons are modifiable.

The aim of this review was to analyze the role of the gut⁻lung axis in asthma development, considering all asthma phenotypes, and to evaluate whether microbe-based therapies may be used for asthma prevention. Several studies have confirmed the role of microbiota in the regulation of immune function and the development of atopy and asthma. These clinical conditions have apparent roots in an insufficiency of early life exposure to the diverse environmental microbiota necessary to ensure colonization of the gastrointestinal and/or respiratory tracts. Commensal microbes are necessary for the induction of a balanced, tolerogenic immune system. The identification of commensal bacteria in both the gastroenteric and respiratory tracts could be an innovative and important issue. In conclusion, the function of microbiota in healthy immune response is generally acknowledged, and gut dysbacteriosis might result in chronic inflammatory respiratory disorders, particularly asthma. Further investigations are needed to improve our understanding of the role of the microbiome in inflammation and its influence on important risk factors for asthma, including tobacco smoke and host genetic features.",asthma; atopy; gut microbiota; immunity; lung microbiota; microbiome.,Franco Frati;Cristina Salvatori;Cristoforo Incorvaia;Alessandro Bellucci;Giuseppe Di Cara;Francesco Marcucci;Susanna Esposito
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31430856/,Consistent Biomarkers and Related Pathogenesis Underlying Asthma Revealed by Systems Biology Approach,"Asthma is a common chronic airway disease worldwide. Due to its clinical and genetic heterogeneity, the cellular and molecular processes in asthma are highly complex and relatively unknown. To discover novel biomarkers and the molecular mechanisms underlying asthma, several studies have been conducted by focusing on gene expression patterns in epithelium through microarray analysis. However, few robust specific biomarkers were identified and some inconsistent results were observed. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct a robust analysis to solve these problems. Herein, an integrated gene expression analysis of ten independent, publicly available microarray data of bronchial epithelial cells from 348 asthmatic patients and 208 healthy controls was performed. As a result, 78 up- and 75 down-regulated genes were identified in bronchial epithelium of asthmatics. Comprehensive functional enrichment and pathway analysis revealed that response to chemical stimulus, extracellular region, pathways in cancer, and arachidonic acid metabolism were the four most significantly enriched terms. In the protein-protein interaction network, three main communities associated with cytoskeleton, response to lipid, and regulation of response to stimulus were established, and the most highly ranked 6 hub genes (up-regulated CD44, KRT6A, CEACAM5, SERPINB2, and down-regulated LTF and MUC5B) were identified and should be considered as new biomarkers. Pathway cross-talk analysis highlights that signaling pathways mediated by IL-4/13 and transcription factor HIF-1α and FOXA1 play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of asthma. Interestingly, three chemicals, polyphenol catechin, antibiotic lomefloxacin, and natural alkaloid boldine, were predicted and may be potential drugs for asthma treatment.

The course of asthma is considered during the typical endocrine phases in women (i.e. pregnancy, menstrual cycle and menopause). A worsening is often reported between the 29th and 36th week of pregnancy; the clinical status during pregnancy is attributed to the interaction between the positive effect of cortisol and the antagonism of DOCA, progesterone, aldosterone on the cortisol-glucocorticoid pulmonary receptors. Also the increase of hypotalamic concentration of noradrenaline which inhibits the pituitary-adrenal axis is considered among of the causes of the worsening of symptoms; moreover the increase of progesterone enhances the gastroesophageal reflux which acts as a trigger stimulus and causes bronchospasm. The therapeutic aspects are examined. All the pharmacologic principles are considered regarding the possible harm to the pregnant woman or the fetus. The oldest and well established molecules are considered the most reliable. Bronchial asthma is then examined with regard to menstrual cycle; pre-menstrual asthma is critically reviewed.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/589783/,Allergen-induced increase in non-allergic bronchial reactivity,"Non-allergic bronchial hyper-reactivity is a feature of most patients with asthma. We have measured non-allergic bronchial reactivity to inhaled histamine and methacholine in thirteen asthmatic subjects before and after allergen inhalation in the laboratory. The allergen inhalation produced mild early asthmatic responses (19-40% FEV1 fall) in all thirteen, additional definite late asthmatic responses (17-29% FEV1 fall) in four, and equivocal late asthmatic responses (5-11% FEV1 fall) in five. Following allergen inhalation, non-allergic bronchial reactivity increased in seven for up to 7 days. The seven included all four with definite late asthmatic responses and three of the five with equivocal late asthmatic responses. We conclude that allergens make asthma worse, partly through non-allergic mechanisms, and that avoidance of allergens is important in reducing non-allergic bronchial hyper-reactivity.",,D W Cockcroft;R E Ruffin;J Dolovich;F E Hargreave
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3534048/,Occupational asthma,"Occupational asthma accounts for a significant percentage of all asthma. Prevalence varies markedly, depending on host factors, the agent, and the manufacturing facility. The number of agents capable of inducing occupational asthma is large and will continue to increase as new agents are introduced into the workplace. Once an individual is sensitized, very low concentrations of the agent can initiate an asthmatic response. In many cases the mechanisms of the asthma are yet to be determined. The ultimate outcome of both the specific asthmatic response and the nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity that usually occurs is variable, but in some cases it can continue for decades. Future needs are a better understanding of the prevalence of occupational asthma and the causative mechanisms involved in the disease and prophylactic or ""desensitizing"" measures. Environmental experts should explore methods to decrease the exposure of workers, and manufacturers should also begin to explore the possibility that chemical modification of their products may reduce their asthmatic potential (e.g., MDI, which has a vapor pressure 1000 times less than TDI, appears to be a significantly less potent inducer of occupational asthma). Finally, the physician, by identifying individuals with occupational asthma, will help improve our understanding of the disease, the mechanisms involved, and the development of therapeutic and preventive modalities.",,B T Butcher;J E Salvaggio
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12379273/,Asthma: the importance of epithelial mesenchymal communication in pathogenesis. Inflammation and the airway epithelium in asthma,"Asthma is a disorder of the airways in which Th-2-mediated inflammation is considered to provide the basis for altered structure and function that leads to bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) and variable airflow obstruction. This linear progression underpinning asthma pathophysiology is questioned on the basis of observations on the pathology of the disease in early childhood, the independent genetic factors that influence atopy and BHR, incomplete responses to treatment with corticosteroids despite powerful anti-inflammatory effects and the recent disappointing results with targeted therapies that almost abolish eosinophilia in the blood and airways and yet produce little effect on the clinical outcomes of asthma. An alternative hypothesis is put forward in which atopy/airway inflammation and altered structure and function of the formed airway elements are parallel but interacting factors. For asthma to develop as a chronic disease, genetic and environmental factors that drive each of these components are required. Fundamental to this is the concept of aberrant signalling between the airway epithelium and underlying mesenchyme and persistent activation of the epithelial mesenchymal trophic unit.",,D E Davies;S T Holgate
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27573930/,"Allergic Asthma: A Summary from Genetic Basis, Mouse Studies, to Diagnosis and Treatment","Asthma is an allergic disease that affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. Two of its phenotypes routinely assessed at the clinic include airway hyperresponsiveness and IgE production. They can be measured in a non-invasive manner and have been used for genetic studies. The genetic complexity of asthma and its phenotypes makes it difficult to map their genetic contributors. Human studies require large sample sizes and proper segregation of the population to control for potential confounding factors. As an alternative, asthma genetics can be studied in mice due to the high degree of homology in the genome and immune response between mice and humans. The variety of mouse strains and allergic asthma protocols allow to study different aspects of the disease while controlling for the genetic background. Studying the genetic basis of asthma phenotypes has helped gain a better understanding of the disease mechanism. Candidate genes identified from genetic studies have served as targets for the development of new and specialized treatments. New treatments are high in demand as the symptoms of a large number of asthmatics are not properly controlled with the existing treatment guidelines involving corticosteroids, β2-adrenoreceptor agonists, and anti-leukotrienes or leukotriene modifiers. Promising findings have been obtained from studies exploring new treatments targeting specific immune cell mediators, which were identified as candidates in genetic studies, and cell adhesion molecules. In addition to targeting members of the Th1/Th2 inflammatory profile, mediators of the omega-3 fatty acid pathway are also emerging as novel targets of drug intervention for allergic asthma.",Allergic asthma; IgE; airway hyperresponsiveness; asthma genetics; mouse models; treatments.,Cynthia Kanagaratham;Danuta Radzioch

In spite of well-established relationships between asthma etiology and the broader living environments, multilevel research on asthma shows at best marginal geographic effects. Based on in-depth, open-ended interviews with 50 caretakers of school-age children (6-12 years) diagnosed with asthma living in two different communities, this article elucidates mechanisms by which neighborhood effects may be neutralized. Caretakers of children with mild, controllable asthma attempt to create asthma-safe zones by administering long-term control and quick-relief medication, by removing indoor environmental triggers and by avoiding dangerous environments. At home, school and outdoors, the key strategy to control asthma was the use of relatively effective and accessible medications.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24925386/,Asthma,"'Asthma' is derived from the Greek root ασθμαινω, meaning 'gasp for breath'. The term originally did not define a disease, but was employed to describe respiratory symptoms of a variety of pulmonary conditions. Over the centuries, several models have been proposed to understand the pathophysiologic abnormalities of asthma. By the beginning of the 20th century, asthma was seen to be a unique illness characterized by 'spasmodic afflictions of the bronchial tubes'. Consistent with the nature of asthma as a complex disease, the models for asthma pathogenesis have become increasingly complex. Research has moved from antiquated ideas to a descriptive functional approach to one that relies on pathophysiology in cellular and molecular biology, immunology, microbiology and genetics/genomics. As more advanced technologies for measuring lung function were developed, the features of asthma were steadily unraveled and its pathophysiology clarified. Asthma was shown to be associated with transient increases in airway resistance, reductions in forced expiratory volumes and flows, hyperinflation of the lungs and increased work of breathing, as well as abnormalities in the distribution of ventilation, perfusion and arterial blood gases. Today, asthma is seen as a chronic inflammatory disease which is not yet fully understood in its pathophysiology; therefore, therapy is still on the path to becoming optimal.",,Karl-Christian Bergmann

Our aim has been to review current knowledge of the impact of obesity on asthma severity, asthma control, and response to therapy. Several studies have shown that overweight and obesity is associated with more severe asthma and impaired quality of life, compared with normal weight individuals. Furthermore, obesity is associated with poorer asthma control, as assessed by asthma control questionnaires, limitations in daily activities, breathlessness and wheezing, use of rescue medication, unscheduled doctor visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations for acute asthma. Studies of the impact of a high body mass index on response to asthma therapy have, however, revealed conflicting results. Most studies show that overweight and obesity is associated with less favorable response to asthma therapy, with regard to symptoms, level of FEV1, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide, and airway responsiveness. Some studies suggest that asthma in the obese patient might be more responsive to leukotriene modifiers, orchestrated by leptin and/or adiponectin derived from adipose tissue, than to inhaled corticosteroids, possibly reflecting differences in the underlying airway inflammation in obese versus non-obese asthmatics. In conclusion, overweight and obesity is associated with poorer asthma control and, very importantly, overall poorer response to asthma therapy, compared with normal weight individuals.",,Caroline Trunk-Black Juel;Charlotte Suppli Ulrik

Even in this new scientific age, getting the basics of asthma management right remains essential. The new technologies which can be applied to multiple biological samples include genomics (study of the genome), transcriptomics (gene transcription), lipidomics, proteomics and metabolomics (lipids, proteins and metabolites, respectively) and breathomics, using exhaled breath as a source of biomarkers, which is of particular interest in view of its non-invasive nature in pediatrics. Important applications will include the diagnosis of airways disease, including its components; the pathways driving airway pathology; monitoring the response to treatment; and measuring future risk (asthma attacks, poor lung growth trajectory). With the advent of a wide range of novel biologicals to treat asthma, -omics technology to personalize therapy will be especially important. The U-BIOPRED (Europe) and SARP (USA) groups have been most active in this field, especially using bronchoscopically obtained samples to perform cluster analyses to define new asthma endotypes. However, stability over time and consistency between investigators is imperfect. This is perhaps unsurprising; results of biomarker studies in asthma will be a composite of the underlying disease, the (variable) effects of adverse drivers such as allergen exposure and pollution, the effects of treatment, and the effects of adherence or otherwise to treatment. Ultimately, the aim should be an exhaled breath based tool with a rapid result that can be used as a routine in the clinic.

Antiinflammatory drugs such as nedocromil, DNCG, cysteinyl leukotrienes or inhaled corticosteroids are efficient and widely recommended. Yet there is a lack between therapeutic possibilities and outcome: too many patients are treated too late, with the wrong drugs in a wrong way, and their compliance is poor. In children less than two or three years of age the diagnosis of asthma is difficult. But it is highly important to start therapy early to avoid irreversible damage of the lung.

Part of the problem lies in over-reliance on simple animal models of antigen sensitization and challenge to select therapeutic candidates, and partly because allergic mechanisms have been studied out of context of the formed elements that make up the structure of the airways such as the epithelium and underlying vasculature and mesenchyme. This review covers recent experience with some new therapeutics that include biologics and concludes by presenting a new paradigm for the disease that embraces heterogeneity and greater consideration of the role played by functionally active structural components. Since asthma was originally described in terms of reversible airflow obstruction, this moves away from placing inflammation at the center of the disease more towards a parallel involvement of the epithelial mesenchymal trophic unit to provide the context within which the inflammatory response occurs.",,Stephen T Holgate
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3715168/,[Criteria for evaluating specific desensitization in asthma],"In the absence of any satisfactory immunological criteria an objective assessment of the results of desensitization in asthma largely rests on clinical criteria. The use of clinical criteria themselves runs into many difficulties, some of which are inherent in the nature of asthma (chronic cause, temporary variations, variations according to the allergen responsible, the association of non-specific factors to specific allergic factors) and others result from the individual characters of the asthmatic under-study. The assessment of the results of desensitization should not rest solely on the observations of the patient and physician. A clinical score can be gathered thanks to a daily diary card. A drug score can be assessed by a daily record of the amount of medication used. The recording of peak flow in spite of its imperfections is particularly well suited to multiple daily measurements of airflow obstruction. The paper work generated by the daily diary cards can be computerised. A study of the correlations existing between the different daily scores recorded shows, that the selection of patients for a trial of desensitization should be carried out over a long enough period to enable non compliant patients to be discarded namely those patients without any good correlation between the symptoms and functional score. Another approach to assessing the efficacy of desensitization is the study of changes in bronchial provocation tests to allergens; these depend on a good reproducibility of the immediate and delayed responses to allergens in each subject at different times.",,G Pauli;J C Bessot;M C Kopferschmitt-Kubler

It has been estimated that 15% of all adult asthmatics suffer from asthma caused by occupational exposure. The prevalence of occupational asthma varies depending on the nature of the industrial agent, the concentration of exposure and working conditions. In Italy diisocyanates and flour dusts are the commonest causes (60%) of occupational asthma. The diagnosis of occupational asthma is made by confirming the diagnosis of bronchial asthma and by establishing a relationship between asthma and the work environment. History and measurement of non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity are useful to establish a clinical diagnosis, while skin (or serologic) tests with the appropriate extract may be useful in the identification of the responsible agent (high molecular weight compounds such as protein). With low molecular agents (e.g. diisocyanates, wood dust, colophony) the specific bronchial provocation test in hospital or the measurement of lung function tests at work (""stop-resume"" test) are required. There are few follow-up studies of patients with occupational asthma; all of them show that only 40% (mean) of the patients completely recover after cessation of exposure. Atopy (one or more skin prick tests positive to common allergens) is not sufficiently discriminative for screening purposes when a person enters a new occupational environment where an occupational asthma agent is present. Preemployment screening is useful to define the higher risk workers: atopy may be used as an indication for more frequent or more strict monitoring in periodic medical surveillance.",,E Sartorelli;A Innocenti

During the first 20-30 min of a thunderstorm, patients suffering from pollen allergies may inhale a high concentration of the allergenic material that is dispersed into the atmosphere, which in turn can induce asthmatic reactions, often severe. Subjects without asthma symptoms, but affected by seasonal rhinitis can also experience an asthma attack. All subjects affected by pollen allergy should be alerted to the danger of being outdoors during a thunderstorm in the pollen season, as such events may be an important cause of severe exacerbations.

Yet, outcome data from throughout the world (emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and quality of life) indicate that the diagnosis and treatment of asthma are not optimal and need improvement. Why? First, asthma is not thought of as a complex, heterogeneous disease or syndrome that consists of different phenotypes and endotypes. Second, asthma is variable, particularly in its severity, and is influenced by known, unknown, avoidable, and unavoidable environmental factors. Third, treatment usually requires complex inhalational devices that are difficult to understand and use, and with which adherence is suboptimal. Continued education on how to appropriately use medications, particularly inhaled medications, is absolutely essential, and knowledge and access to a backup treatment plan to be initiated by the patient for an asthma flare is necessary. Fourth, assessment of asthma is primarily based on symptoms, and, at times, all symptoms are due to asthma, but many times some or all symptoms are due to unrecognized and untreated comorbid or coexisting conditions. Too often, asthma is viewed as a disease that occurs in isolation, and comorbid and coexisting conditions are not appropriately identified and treated.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12629009/,Airway remodeling in asthma,"Chronic inflammation and remodeling may follow acute inflammation or may begin insidiously as a low-grade smoldering response, especially in the case of immune reactions. The histologic hallmarks of chronic inflammation and remodeling are as follows: (1) infiltration by macrophages and lymphocytes; (2) proliferation of fibroblasts that may take the form of myofibroblasts; (3) angiogenesis; (4) increased connective tissue (fibrosis); and (5) tissue destruction. It is clear that changes in the extracellular matrix, smooth muscle, and mucous glands have the capacity to influence airway function and reactivity in asthma patients. However, it is not known how each of the many structural changes that occur in the airway wall contributes to altered airway function in asthma. In asthma, remodeling is almost always present in biopsy specimens (eg, collagen deposition on basement membrane) but is not always clinically demonstrated. Destruction and subsequent remodeling of the normal bronchial architecture are manifested by an accelerated decline in FEV(1) and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. This irreversible component of airway obstruction is more prominent in patients with severe disease and even persists after aggressive anti-inflammatory treatment. Airway remodeling appears to be of great importance for understanding the long-term follow-up of asthmatic patients, but there are major gaps in our knowledge. Physiologic correlations with pathology represent a major missing link that should be filled. More long-term studies are needed to appreciate the prevention and treatment of remodeling. Future research therefore should provide better methods for limiting airway remodeling in asthma patients.",,Antonio M Vignola;Franco Mirabella;Giorgio Costanzo;Rossana Di Giorgi;Mark Gjomarkaj;Vincenzo Bellia;Giovanni Bonsignore
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34338015/,The multidisciplinary team severe asthma day case assessment and its impact on patient care,"People with severe and difficult to control asthma can be a complex and heterogenous group of patients often with multiple comorbidities. Living with this disease imposes a huge physical and psychological burden upon the patient which requires a comprehensive, systematic and patient-focused assessment, using a wide range of clinical expertise from within the multidisciplinary team. This article describes a severe asthma systematic and multidimensional day case assessment, and the positive benefits that the authors perceive it offers for patient care. These benefits include a confirmed diagnosis, consideration of alternative diagnosis, enhanced adherence, medication optimisation, access to and gatekeeping of high-cost specialist medications, improved patient self-management skills and signposting to appropriate therapies. As a consequence, they believe that this facilitates better patient outcomes through a reduction in corticosteroid exposure, exacerbations and hospitalisation. This severe asthma multidisciplinary team day case approach offers more than just physical benefits when compared with the traditional medical model. Patient feedback reports an excellent patient experience, feeling listened to, understood, empowered and hopeful for the future.",Adherence; Chronic disease; Multidisciplinary team; Quality of life; Severe asthma.,Leanne-Jo Holmes;Reyenna Sheehan;Lynn Elsey;David Allen
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18065189/,[Exacerbation in asthma: definitions and immunopathology],"There is no unequivocal definition of exacerbation in asthma. These are defined as episodes of increased or aggravated respiratory symptoms or as use of oral corticosteroid therapy. Viral infection is the most frequent cause of exacerbations. Inflammation during exacerbations is heterogeneous. It may be associated with bronchial hypereosinophilia, which is used as a predictive marker for exacerbation, and with neutrophilia, which is more resistant to corticosteroids. During viral infection, an inappropriate Th1 antiviral inflammation develops, associated with the intrinsic Th2 activity that leads to an aberrant immune response. Exacerbations secondary to allergen exposure are classically described as due to a Th2-type inflammation; but Th1 response also seems to play a role. Exposure to air pollutants appears able not only to induce bronchial inflammation but also to potentiate the inflammatory reactions of patients with exacerbations.",,Arnaud Cavaillès;Domitille Pinot;Ana Nieves;Karine Botturi;Anne-Marie Lorec;Daniel Vervloet;Manuel Tunon de Lara;Antoine Magnan

Furthermore, removal of allergen exposure is followed by improvement in both symptoms and evidence of airway inflammation. Allergen immunotherapy reduces the sensitivity of the respiratory tract to allergens, blocks the influx of eosinophils and mucosal mast cells in response to allergen exposure, and alters the pattern of cytokine release by T-lymphocytes, generally decreasing Th2-related cytokines (IL-4) and increasing those related to the Th1 response (interferon-gamma, IL-2, IL-12). It would be remarkable, given these alterations in responsiveness produced by allergen immunotherapy, if this treatment were not effective in bronchial asthma. Indeed, an analysis of controlled studies of allergen immunotherapy does indicate that it is clinically effective in carefully selected, allergic asthmatics.",,H S Nelson

In some countries the textile industry remains an important source of potential agents causing occupational asthma. In the textile industry several agents such as cotton dust and dyes may cause occupational asthma. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis/mechanisms, clinical presentations, management and prevention specific to occupational asthma in the textile industry.Work-related asthma risk is considerable. Current understanding of the mechanisms by which many textile agents cause occupational asthma is limited, especially for low molecular-weight sensitizers and irritants. The diagnosis is generally established on the basis of a suggestive history of a temporal association between exposure and the onset of symptoms and objective evidence that these symptoms are related to airflow limitation. Early diagnosis, elimination or reduction of exposure to the offending agent and early use of convenient therapy according to disease severity may play an important role in the prevention of long-term persistence of asthma. Its prevention in the textile industry should be both technical and medical. It depends on the difficulties to reduce dust level, the limits in arranging work station or in occupational rehabilitation. These difficulties are increased in small textile industry companies. Persistent occupational asthma in this sector is often associated with substantial disability and consequent impacts on income and quality of life. Prevention of new cases is the best approach to reduce the burden of asthma attributable to occupational exposures.

Bronchiectasis, one of the most frequent asthma-associated comorbidities, can increase airways inflammation and exacerbation rates and cause respiratory functional impairment. The aim of this article is to review the interactions between bronchiectasis and asthma, in order to better identify patients in the overlap between the 2 diseases and to select an ""ad hoc"" therapy. A literature search on PubMed/MEDLINE was performed using the following search terms: bronchiectasis in asthma, the association between asthma and bronchiectasis, comorbidities in asthma, and severe asthma. This review analyzed the following items: incorrect or underestimated diagnosis of asthma and bronchiectasis, prevalence of bronchiectasis in asthma, the impact of bronchiectasis in asthma, radiological imaging features of the 2 diseases, etiopathogenesis, and common causes (such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, immune deficits, chronic rhinosinusitis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and treatment of asthma and bronchiectasis). The concomitant presence of bronchiectasis and asthma should be suspected and investigated in patients with severe asthma, frequent exacerbations, and not responding to standard therapy. This clinical phenotype, characterized by a more severe disease, worse outcomes, and functional decline, must be readily recognized in order to choose the most appropriate therapeutic approach, able to potentially improve the management of bronchial asthma, to prevent the onset of exacerbations as well the functional decline, and to reduce health costs.",Airways disease; Asthma; Bronchiectasis; Comorbidities in asthma.,Claudia Crimi;Sebastian Ferri;Raffaele Campisi;Nunzio Crimi

There is a consensus that a stepped-up approach with anti-inflammatory drugs based on severity forms the cornerstone of treatment. Goals of management have been defined. Studies in several countries have however shown that a large majority of patients have failed to attain the goals of treatment. This has led to a reconsideration of strategy of management. The focus is now shifting to an assessment and a treatment approach based on control. The objective is to achieve and monitor to maintain control. The previous treatment algorithms based on assessment of severity are being discarded. It has been emphasised that the state of control is a dynamic one and therefore a regular assessment and modifications of treatment according to changes in its level are necessary. There is a need to use some method to assess control. A wide range of techniques to assess control are available that can be used depending on the requirements, settings and resources. Assessment of control may be an informal global judgement by the physician or simple tools may be used. Several formal instruments to assess the state of control have also been developed and validated in different settings. These allow a more objective and a quantitative evaluation.

The improved immunologic methods for the diagnosis of allergic diseases in the last twenty years has in general confirmed the results obtained by the intradermal test. However, it is important to bear in mind that in a reliable ""in vivo"" diagnostic, the technique has to be considered, and that there is a better correlation in the intracutaneous test than in the Prick one. Of the various immunologic tests carried out, the hemagglutination test offers a better reliability in the diagnosis of food-induced bronchial asthma, together with the histamine release test. In our experience, the RAST was less reliable when it came to the diagnosis of food allergy, though on the other hand it was applicable for inhalant allergens (pollens and dermatophagoides). In clinical practice and in daily routine work ups, all these techniques of course, impose an additional cost for diagnosis. Therefore, the use of sophisticated modern immunologic methods has to be reserved unless needed for clinical research, or as happens in some cases, for suspicious clinical histories with negative skin tests, in order to confirm the possible allergens responsible.",,A Oehling

Although recent surveys have reported that the majority of pediatric patients with asthma in the United States and Europe have symptoms consistent with mild disease, these surveys have limitations in design. Thus, the true prevalence of mild asthma remains unknown. It is unclear whether children with mild persistent asthma progress to more severe asthma, but the risk of severe asthma exacerbations seems to be unrelated to the symptom severity. Clinical studies restricted to pediatric patients with mild asthma are limited, but available data do suggest substantial morbidity of mild persistent asthma in this population and support inhaled corticosteroid intervention.

We investigated 90 school-age children with the diagnosis of asthma and their accompanying parent to evaluate whether we can obtain better information by using three different means of asking for asthma symptoms: a questionnaire for children (QSR(children)), ""smilies,"" and a visual analogue scale for children (VAS(children)). Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between these symptom reports and lung function results. Finally, we attempted to determine whether performing a lung function test contributes relevant information toward improving asthma management. Multiple linear regression adjusted for age and gender showed a significant relationship between VAS for children and forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV(1)) (P = 0.047) and maximal expiratory flow at 50% of forced vital capacity (MEF(50)) (P = 0.037). Neither age, gender, QSR for children, ""smilies for children"" nor all the parents' scores showed a significant association with lung function measurement in the regression model. Subgroup analysis with Spearman's rank correlation coefficients by age group revealed significant correlation in children <10 years between VAS for children, QSR for parents, smilies for parents, and the lung function parameters FEV(1), and MEF(50). Above age 10 years there was no correlation at all, with the accuracy correlation ranging from -0.04 to +0.21. Our data demonstrate that reported symptoms do not reliably correlate with lung function results in asthmatic children and the childrens' parents, and correlation is dependent on the instrument used for symptom evaluation. In children, the VAS, and in parents, the QSR were the most valuable means of obtaining best information on asthma symptoms.

With regard to functional abnormalities, 32% of patients presented with values within the range of normal, 23% showed pulmonary hyperinflation (FRC greater than 130% predicted), 42% had bronchial obstruction (Raw greater than 130% pred.) and 3% showed restriction of static lung volumes (TLC less than 80% pred.). 91 patients with perennial continuing asthma have been followed up under regular anti-asthmatic treatment over 2 years, during which at least 3 lung function tests have been performed. The study shows that asthmatic children must be evaluated according to the kind and degree of functional abnormalities and within certain age groups. Best improvement after treatment, mainly by inhalation of beta-2-mimetrics and mastcell stabilisators, and partly also by topical steroids, was found in the age groups 8-10 years and 11-13 years respectively. In spite of treatment asthmatic children showed an increase in bronchial constriction in the 5-7 year age group and an increase in pulmonary hyperinflation in the 14-16 age group.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16493159/,Difficult asthma,"The correct diagnosis of asthma is usually easily made and most patients with asthma respond to therapy. Approximately 5% of patients with asthma, however, have disease that is difficult to control despite taking maximal doses of inhaled medications. Patients with therapy-resistant or difficult-to-control asthma require a rigorous and systematic approach to their diagnosis and treatment. The first step is evaluation and testing directed at determining that asthma is the correct diagnosis. Many diseases mimic asthma and these alternate diagnoses should be considered. The second step is to identify and eliminate triggers that worsen asthma. Cigarette smoking, occupational exposures, and allergic rhinitis contribute to worsening disease. Most patients with ""difficult asthma"" require treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting inhaled beta(2)-agonists. Despite maximal inhaled therapy, these patients will require either frequent bursts or chronic daily therapy with oral corticosteroids. These patients may have ""resistant"" inflammation with a persistent inflammatory state. Numerous studies also suggest that compliance with asthma therapy is poor. Combination therapy with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta(2)-agonist in a single inhaler may improve patient compliance. In selected patients, additional therapy with leukotriene modifiers or anti-IgE antibody can result in improved asthma control and may allow tapering of corticosteroids. Use of methotrexate is not justified based on current data. Emerging evidence suggests that different phenotypes of difficult or therapy-resistant asthma exist.

This review discusses additional specific points for elderly patients. These patients are very heterogeneous. Their asthma can have begun at any time and can vary greatly in severity. It is frequently associated not only with any of the diseases that affect older persons but also with comorbid lung diseases. Many patients have irreversible airway obstruction, which is due to severe airway remodeling, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or bronchiectasis. Diagnosis should include chest radiography and computed tomographic scanning to diagnose other lung diseases if FEV₁ remains low after treatment. Asthma pathogenesis includes not only IgE-mediated allergy but also innate immune inflammation from endotoxin and trypsin-like proteases, and therefore evaluation and control of environmental exposures is an important part of management. Pharmacologic treatment, too, is adjusted to achieve and maintain control and is basically the same for all ages, except that elderly patients have reduced response to bronchodilators and increased side effects from beta adrenergic agonists and glucocorticoids. Many elderly patients have difficulty inhaling aerosols, and therefore nebulizers might be a better delivery system. Oral medications have the benefit of greater ease of administration and greater efficacy on the peripheral airways. Leukotriene antagonists and low-dose theophylline are often helpful additives to aerosol glucocorticoids. Oral glucocorticoids might be indicated for severe asthma.",,Charles E Reed

Multidimensional assessment (MDA) of specific traits has been proposed as an effective strategy to manage severe asthma, although it is supported by few prospective studies. We aimed to systematically review the literature published on MDA in severe asthma, to identify the traits included in MDA and to determine the effect of MDA on asthma-related outcomes. We identified 26 studies and classified these based on study type (cohort/cross-sectional studies; experimental/outcome studies; and severe asthma disease registries). Study type determined the comprehensiveness of the assessment. Assessed traits were classified into three domains (airways, co-morbidities and risk factors). The airway domain had the largest number of traits assessed (mean ± SD = 4.2 ± 1.7) compared with co-morbidities (3.6 ± 2.2) and risk factors (3.9 ± 2.1). Bronchodilator reversibility and airflow limitation were assessed in 92% of studies, whereas airway inflammation was only assessed in 50%. Commonly assessed co-morbidities were psychological dysfunction, sinusitis (both 73%) and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD; 69%). Atopic and smoking statuses were the most commonly assessed risk factors (85% and 86%, respectively).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19331719/,Measurement of specific airway resistance decreased the risk of delay in asthma diagnosis in children,"Factors that facilitate the asthma diagnosis in children are still being investigated. We attempted to assess the duration of a delay in asthma diagnosis in children, and we examined the previously identified risk factors of its occurrence together with the pulmonary function test results such as spirometry and specific airway resistance (sR(aw)) and sought to determine how the measurement of sR(aw) contributes to asthma diagnosis in children. This study was a part of the Asthma Prevention Study in Poland, which focused on increasing early detection of asthma in a community-based cohort. Data were collected using a questionnaire during regular doctor visits. Childrens' medical documentation from the time period between birth and the visit was analyzed. Participants with the duration of an undiagnosed asthma above the upper quartile range of this variable were defined as having a delayed asthma diagnosis. The independent risk factors of the delayed asthma diagnosis included the absence of atopy, allergic rhinitis symptoms, asthma/allergy in a family, and living in the single-parent families. The whole-body plethysmography performed simultaneously with the spirometry revealed the underestimation of reversibility of bronchial obstruction in 16.4% of participants. This underestimation of reversibility of bronchial obstruction was the only modifiable, independent risk factor of the delayed asthma diagnosis in children. Measurement of sR(aw) contributes significantly to asthma diagnosis in children at risk of the delayed asthma diagnosis.",,Agnieszka Brzozowska;Paweł Majak;Tomasz Grzelewski;Włodzimierz Stelmach;Joanna Kaczmarek;Piotr Stelmach;Joanna Jerzynska;Iwona Stelmach

He presented in severe respiratory distress, with hypoxemia and marked pulmonary hyperinflation. Administration of inhaled bronchodilator was ineffective because of agitation, and the patient could not be positioned for chest physiotherapy to treat presumed widespread mucus plugging. High-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) in the sitting position initially caused increased distress but was subsequently tolerated when noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) via nasal mask was initiated. Almost immediately, the patient began expectorating bronchial mucus casts, with concomitant clinical improvement. Endotracheal intubation was avoided, and with aggressive pharmacologic treatment for acute severe asthma and continuation of intermittent HFCWO-NPPV, the patient made a full recovery over the next several days. This case suggests that the combination of HFCWO and NPPV may be helpful in the presence of mucus plugging as a complication of acute inhalation injury or acute severe asthma.",,Toshihiko Koga;Taketoshi Kawazu;Kazuo Iwashita;Ritsuko Yahata

The disease is characterized by bronchial hyperreactivity to physical, chemical, pharmacological, and/or immunological irritants. The incidence of perioperative complications is higher in asthmatics than in non-asthmatics. Careful pre- and postoperative care can reduce complications in these patients. Successful management of an asthmatic patient undergoing anesthesia starts with the identification of patients with asthma, the preoperative assessment, and evaluation of the pulmonary function. No elective surgery should be performed in patients suffering from unstable asthma or an acute attack. Thorough knowledge of the effects and interactions of broncholytic therapy with anesthesia is mandatory. Preanesthetic management must take into consideration the etiology of the disease; intraoperatively, attention must be paid to the pathophysiology. Appropriate perioperative monitoring can help to prevent complications. No one type of anesthesia is associated with lower postoperative complications. The skill of the anesthesiologist, early recovery from general anesthesia, and good postoperative care greatly reduce the incidence of complications. Besides the changes in pulmonary function that occur following anesthesia and surgery, asthmatics may suffer from abnormalities in control of ventilation and mucociliary function postoperatively.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3316996/,The epidemiology of asthma,"As noted earlier, the clinician and the epidemiologist are in many respects in similar positions in terms of our current understanding of asthma. Through the efforts of the pharmaceutical industry the practitioner has a much wider range of therapeutic tools available to manage reversible airways disease. B-agonists are more specific, have a longer duration of action, minimizing the potential for abuse and coincident toxicity. Theophylline preparations are long-acting and therapeutic drug levels can be accurately assessed. Inhaled corticosteroids provide the opportunity to reduce the negative side aspects of hormonal therapy. Unfortunately, with all these tools, the morbidity and mortality of asthma have not been decreased. In fact, it may be that the disease is a greater worldwide health problem than it was a generation ago. Similarly, epidemiologic research has provided us with increasingly meaningful information, not only of the prevalence of the disease, but with recent longitudinal studies, the factors which impact upon disease remission and relapse. Whether we separate the wheezing syndromes into separate categories of wheezy bronchitis, asthmatic bronchitis, and asthma is probably less important than our understanding of a disease entity which is characterized by bronchial hyper-reactivity in response to a variety of stimuli. The most encouraging aspects of recent epidemiologic research have been the selection of representative populations, using standardized methods, from which significant conclusions can be drawn. At the least, these studies have confirmed and extended our knowledge of a disease that we still do not fully understand. Woolcock et al.[56], and others, have included inhalation challenge testing into their epidemiologic protocols in an attempt to add physiologic assessments to the more traditional symptom complexes. Unfortunately, even this addition has not solved the problem of an asthma diagnosis in the older adult population whose irreversible airways obstructive disease is a confounding variable. Even in younger subjects, as reported by Townley et al.[14], a gradation of responses to methacholine inhalation in atopic subjects, may make the identification of asthmatics more difficult than initially thought.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3880532/,Special features of asthma in children,"Asthma in children has many special features which deserve consideration. This disease is probably underdiagnosed and is often undertreated. Vague, persistent respiratory symptoms, especially chronic cough, may often be due to asthma. Chronic bronchitis is extremely rare in the pediatric patient and is a manifestation of reactive airway disease or cystic fibrosis. The absolute severity, the extent of the disease, responses to treatment, and long-term course should be evaluated by repeated pulmonary function tests. Fortunately, asthma responds well to pharmacologic and supportive therapy, and it is important to approach its management as that of a chronic rather than episodic illness. Therapy should include comprehensive, closely supervised drug therapy, health education, and a program of self-management. Asthma usually starts before youngsters enter school, and the majority get better as they get older. Nevertheless, many children with moderate or severe asthma will continue to be troubled by intermittent or chronic airway obstruction into adulthood, and they require long-term, anticipatory treatment programs. Comprehensive care will optimize the quality of life for the affected children and their families, and it will minimize the discomfort and restrictions to which some of them have been subjected unnecessarily. Asthma in childhood, especially when not well controlled, may constitute a risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adulthood; however, this is as yet only suspected and not proved.",,G J Cropp

This study aims at learning effective asthma management from the volcano disaster of Mount Asama eruption in Japan on September 1, 2004. We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess the acute impact of volcanic ash on asthma symptoms and their treatment changes by using a questionnaire completed by 236 adult asthmatic patients and their physicians. In the ashfall over 100g/m2 area, 42.9 percent of asthma patients suffered exacerbations, PEF decreased, asthma treatments increased, and inhalation of beta2 stimulants was used most for exacerbated asthma. Compared to severe asthma patients, mild and moderate asthma patients were most at risk. Severe asthma patients were not affected since most of them knew their asthma status was severe, and did not go outside and kept windows closed. Deteriorated asthma symptoms of wheezing, chest tightness and cough appeared in the ashfall over 100g/m2 area. Ash contained inhalable 10microm diameter particles, and included high concentrations of airway toxic substrates of silica. These data suggest that ashfall over 100 g/m2 is harmful, access to these areas by asthma patients needs to be restricted, and these areas need to improve asthma treatment. In addition, the increase in the proportion of asthma patients with wheeze and cough are diagnostic clues for ash-induced asthma in affected areas, and can be used by doctors to tell whether patients are receiving sufficient asthma treatment.",,Y Shimizu;K Dobashi;T Hisada;A Ono;M Todokoro;H Iijima;M Utsugi;S Kakegawa;K Iizuka;T Ishizuka;A Morikawa;M Mori
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16363886/,Overcoming gaps in the management of asthma in older patients: new insights,"Asthma is under-recognised and undertreated in older populations. This is not surprising, given that one-third of older people experience significant breathlessness. The differential diagnosis commonly includes asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, malignancy, aspiration and infections. Because symptoms and signs of several cardiorespiratory diseases are nonspecific in older people and diseases commonly co-exist, investigations are important. A simple strategy for the investigation of breathlessness in older people should include a full blood count, chest radiograph, ECG, peak flow diary and/or spirometry with reversibility as a minimum. If there are major abnormalities on the ECG, an echocardiogram should also be performed. Diurnal variability in peak flow readings >or=20% or >or=15% reversibility in forced expiratory volume in 1 second, spontaneously or with treatment, support a diagnosis of asthma. Distinguishing asthma from COPD is important to allow appropriate management of disease based on aetiology, accurate prediction of treatment response, correct prognosis and appropriate management of the chest condition and co-morbidities. The two conditions are usually readily differentiated by clinical features, particularly age at onset, variability of symptoms and nocturnal symptoms in asthma, supported by the results of reversibility testing. Full lung function tests may not necessarily help in differentiating the two entities, although gas transfer factor is characteristically reduced in COPD and usually normal or high in asthma. Methacholine challenge tests previously mainly used in research are now also used widely and safely to confirm asthma in clinical settings. Interest in exhaled nitric oxide as a biomarker of airways inflammation is increasing as a noninvasive tool in the diagnosis and monitoring of asthma. Regular inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the mainstay of treatment of asthma. Even in mild disease in older adults, regular preventive treatment should be considered, given the poor perception of bronchoconstriction by older asthmatic patients. If symptoms persist despite ICS, addition of long-acting beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) should be considered. Addition of LABA to ICS improves asthma control and allows reduction in ICS dose. However, older people have been grossly under-represented in trials of LABA, many trials having excluded those >or=65 years of age. On meta-analysis, beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists (both short acting and long acting) are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in asthma and COPD. While the evidence for excess cardiovascular mortality is stronger for short-acting beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists, it would be prudent to exercise particular care in using beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists (long acting and short acting) in those at risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including older people. Regular review of cardiovascular status (and monitoring of serum potassium concentration) in patients taking beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists is crucial. The response to LABA should be carefully monitored and alternative 'add-on' therapy such as leukotriene receptor antagonists (LRA) should be considered. LRA have fewer adverse effects and in individual cases may be more effective and appropriate than LABA. Long-term trials evaluating beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists and other bronchodilator strategies are needed particularly in the elderly and in patients with cardiovascular co-morbidities. There is no evidence that addition of anticholinergics improves control of asthma further, although the role of long-acting anticholinergics in the prevention of disease progression is currently being researched. Older patients need to be taught good inhaler technique to improve delivery of medications to lungs, minimise adverse effects and reduce the need for oral corticosteroids.

Common precipitating factors include viral upper respiratory infections, exposure to smoke, dust, cold food and cold air. Avoidance of common precipitating factors has been shown to help in better control of asthma. Pharmacotherapy is the main stay of treatment of asthma. Commonly used drugs for better control of asthma are long and short acting bronchodilators, mast cell stabilizers, inhaled steroids, theophylline and steroid sparing agents. After assessment of severity most appropriate medications are selected. For mild episodic asthma the medications are short acting beta agonists as and when required. For mild persistent asthma: as and when required bronchodilators along with a daily maintenance treatment in form of low dose inhaled steroids or cromolyn or oral theophylline or ketotifen are required. Moderate persistent asthma should be treated with inhaled steroids along with long acting beta agonists for symptom control. For severe persistent asthma the recommended treatment includes inhaled steroids, long acting beta agonists with or without theophylline. If symptoms are not well controlled, a minimal dose of oral prednisolone preferably on alternate days may be needed in few patients. Newer drugs like leukotriene antagonists may find a place in control of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and mild and moderate persistent asthma. Patients should be followed up every 8-12 weeks. On each follow up visit patients should be examined by a doctor, compliance to medications should be checked and actual inhalation technique is observed. Depending on the assessment, medications may be decreased or stepped up. For exercise induced bronchoconstriction: cromolyn, short or long acting beta agonists may be used.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10645712/,[Current view on the etiology of childhood bronchial asthma],"In the last decades atopic diseases and among them the incidence of atopic asthma has increased significantly worldwide, first of all in countries of higher technical civilization. In many places the incidence has doubled in 10-20 years compared to the previous period. The investigations have provided a lot of new data about genetic alterations in the background of the disease but the modifications in the genetic material cannot be responsible for the increased frequency of the disease in such a short time. It has become clear that sensibilization in connection with allergens begins in the fetus and continues in the early period after birth. Environmental allergens, especially indoor ones, the allergen burden in extrauterine life, the nutrition factors and later airway inflammations caused by virus--all contribute to the spread of atopy. The harms of civilization contribute to the dominance of T helper 2 cells and therefore to atopy in our immunosystem. It seem, that otherwise useful components like the decrease of infective diseases, vaccinations, better hygienic conditions and ""western"" lifestyle also manipulate our immunosystem in the direction of atopy. Our existing knowledge can provide profilactic tasks against unfavourable processes only to a very small extent.",,E Cserháti
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20406090/,Growing old with asthma: what are the changes and challenges?,"Asthma is a disease that affects approximately 7% of adults residing in the USA; the prevalence is even greater in children and approaches 10%. The CDC has reported that the overall prevalence of lifetime asthma is 10.5%. New-onset asthma is most often seen in children and is associated with atopy; however, the majority of patients will experience a remission during adolescence. Many former asthmatics will have a reoccurrence of their disease in adulthood and asthma may persist thereafter for a lifetime. New-onset asthma may also begin later in life and remission is uncommon. The burden of asthma is therefore high in the geriatric population and healthcare utilization and mortality from asthma is excessive in this age group. There are many differences with asthma occurring in older adults when compared with younger asthmatics. This includes the frequency of medical comorbidities, the presence in many patients of fixed airflow obstruction that resembles chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the lack of perception of dyspnea that may delay effective medical care. Despite these and other differences, the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of asthma in the elderly is similar to that in younger asthmatics and attention to the unique features of aging can lead to improved outcomes in this age group.",,Sidney S Braman

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19187331/,"Acute exacerbations of asthma: epidemiology, biology and the exacerbation-prone phenotype","Asthma is a highly prevalent chronic respiratory disease affecting 300 million people world-wide. A significant fraction of the cost and morbidity of asthma derives from acute care for asthma exacerbations. In the United States alone, there are approximately 15 million outpatient visits, 2 million emergency room visits, and 500,000 hospitalizations each year for management of acute asthma. Common respiratory viruses, especially rhinoviruses, cause the majority of exacerbations in children and adults. Infection of airway epithelial cells with rhinovirus causes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils. The host response to viral infection is likely to influence susceptibility to asthma exacerbation. Having had at least one exacerbation is an important risk factor for recurrent exacerbations suggesting an 'exacerbation-prone' subset of asthmatics. Factors underlying the 'exacerbation-prone' phenotype are incompletely understood but include extrinsic factors: cigarette smoking, medication non-compliance, psychosocial factors, and co-morbidities such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, rhinosinusitis, obesity, and intolerance to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications; as well as intrinsic factors such as deficient epithelial cell production of the anti-viral type I interferons (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta). A better understanding of the biologic mechanisms of host susceptibility to recurrent exacerbations will be important for developing more effective preventions and treatments aimed at reducing the significant cost and morbidity associated with this important global health problem.",,R H Dougherty;J V Fahy

Similarities of the two cases were seen in sex, type of asthma and severity of asthma. The experiences of previous life-threatening asthma did not differ in both groups (43.3% of fatal vs 40.0% of near-fatal). From the viewpoint of type of development of severe exacerbation, rapid exacerbation was more frequent in fatal cases than near-fatal cases, but acute exacerbation after unstable asthma was more in near-fatal asthma. Seventy-six percent of all asthma deaths occurred at home or on the way to the emergency department. The rate of delay of receiving medical care was significantly higher in fatal cases (72%) than near-fatal cases (26%). There was no significant difference in the frequency of medical management before fatal or near-fatal episode such as oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21123639/,Improving the differential diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary care,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma represent a substantial portion of primary care practice. In adults, differentiating asthma from COPD can be difficult but is important because of the marked differences in treatment, disease progression, and outcomes between the 2 conditions. Currently, clinical COPD is often misdiagnosed or undiagnosed until late in the disease. Earlier diagnosis could markedly reduce morbidity and improve quality of life. Establishing a diagnosis of COPD requires spirometry testing, interpreted in the context of the patient's symptoms, smoking status, age, and comorbidities. Additional tests and tools may be helpful in the differential diagnosis, including questionnaires specifically developed to discriminate between COPD and asthma and, in special cases, imaging studies. Follow-up and monitoring of asthma and COPD are always necessary and provide additional benefit in patients in whom only continued care and reassessment can confirm the final diagnosis, such as younger individuals with fixed airway obstruction, smokers with asthma, and patients with both disorders. Key areas for improvement include enhanced case identification, improved quality and interpretation of findings on spirometry, and increased use of tools such as differential diagnosis questionnaires and algorithms to guide the diagnostic and monitoring process. To achieve optimal outcomes, the primary care team should make every effort to establish a firm diagnosis. For this review, we conducted a PubMed search with no time limits using the Medical Subject Headings chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD and asthma, in association with the following search terms: diagnosis, differential diagnosis, mixed or comorbid disease, diagnostic techniques, spirometry, questionnaires, and primary care.",,David B Price;Barbara P Yawn;Rupert C M Jones

The in vivo airway resistance was determined using the modified Konzett-Rössler method. Inhalation of 0.01% of Ba598Br had an inhibitory effect against acetyl-choline (ACh, 10 micrograms/kg i.v.)-evoked bronchoconstriction. The effect of Ba598Br was more powerful and longer lasting than that of the same dose of atropine. Pretreatment with Ba598Br (0.3%) and atropine (0.3%) by inhalation produced a remarkable inhibitory effect on the asthmatic bronchoconstriction induced by inhalation of Ascaris suum antigen in naturally sensitized dogs. In this case, Ba598Br showed a potency of approx. twice that of atropine as estimated from the inhibitory percent. On the other hand, in the case of posttreatment (drugs being inhaled after the antigen inhalation), both drugs showed inhibitory effects of equal degree. As for the effects on increased airway secretion at the time of asthmatic attack, both drugs inhibited the excessive secretions without any remarkable change in the viscosity of the secretions. Inhalation of 0.3% Ba598Br showed a powerful antihistamine action with respect to histamine (Hist, 3 micrograms/kg i.v.)-induced bronchoconstriction after the bilateral cervical vagi and superior laryngeal nerves were amputated. However, almost no effect could be observed with the same dose of atropine. Both Ba598Br and atropine showed relaxing actions of the same degree against ACh contraction on the isolated canine trachea, bronchus and bronchiole preparations, with a particularly strong relaxation being observed in the bronchiole. On the other hand, Ba598Br showed relaxing actions against histamine-induced contractions, which were more powerful than those of atropine, in the bronchus and bronchiole. From the above findings, it is suggested that the Ba598Br inhalation brings about antiasthmatic effects by its persistent, powerful anticholinergic actions and its transient but powerful antihistamine actions.",,S Yanaura;H Mizuno;K Goto;J Kamei;T Hosokawa;K Ohtani;M Misawa

The continuing search for the relationship,"Patients with alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, like those with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, usually present with dyspnea, wheeze, and cough. The similarity in presentation and unfamiliarity among clinicians with AAT deficiency account for much of the delay in diagnosis. Normally, AAT inhibits serine proteases, which cause alveolar destruction, and alters the function of cells that release mediators of inflammation. Diagnostic findings suggesting deficiency include irreversible airflow obstruction, a decreased diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, bibasilar bullous disease on chest films, and a low serum level of AAT. Asthma is usually diagnosed on the basis of clinical findings and response to inhaled beta agonists. The presence of inflammation is believed to be necessary for development of clinically significant asthma. Inflammation added to a deficiency of antiprotease inhibitor activity significantly worsens bronchial hyperreactivity. This is only one mechanism by which AAT deficiency may potentiate allergic and bronchospastic responses. The prevalence of bronchial asthma in patients with AAT deficiency is unknown. Studies by the National Institutes of Health regarding the natural history of AAT deficiency and its response to therapy are under way. Perhaps more will be discovered about the relationship between the disorder and bronchial asthma.",,J S Pina;M P Horan

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8011284/,Immunological aspects of allergic asthma,"Asthma is a chronic obstructive disease of the lower airways. It is characterized by episodic exacerbations of at least partially reversible airflow limitation, along with bronchial hyperreactivity and airway inflammation. This latter characteristic, airway inflammation, is now a major focus of investigation, in large part because of a growing body of evidence to support its critical role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Investigations of the histopathologic, cytologic, and chemical events accompanying fatal and nonfatal asthma, as well as experimental allergen-induced allergic reactions of the lower airways, have confirmed that a wide variety of immunologic phenomena occur, including local release of preformed mediators, newly synthesized metabolites of arachidonic acid, and soluble pro-inflammatory proteins including kinins and cytokines; alterations in vascular permeability and the development of airways edema; leukocyte activation and accumulation; and immune-mediated neurogenic responses that affect airway smooth muscle and other local responses. This information has led to new pharmacologic approaches designed to antagonize each of these elements of the asthmatic diathesis, with varying degrees of success. Nevertheless, the development of novel antagonists of mediators, pro-inflammatory proteins, cells, adhesion molecules, neuropeptides, and their respective receptors have begun to yield additional insight into their relative importance in the immunologic basis of asthma.",,B S Bochner;B J Undem;L M Lichtenstein

Corticosteroids are the most effective anti-inflammatory class of medication currently available for the treatment of asthma. However, as higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids are used the risks of systemic exposure and side effects will correspondingly increase. Justification of the benefits from higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids can only be made if patients with more severe asthma can be identified. Methods to categorize asthma severity have been introduced in various national asthma management guidelines. Unfortunately, there are substantial conceptual and practical differences among these recommended approaches to asthma severity categorization. Furthermore, these recommended approaches suffer from a focus on features of asthma control, such as symptoms, short-acting beta-agonist use, and lung function rather than actual measures of asthma severity that would encompass markers of airway inflammation. Without the endpoints necessary to assess airway inflammation, current recommendations for asthma severity categorization may lead to systematic under dosing of appropriate anti-inflammatory therapy with subsequent perpetuation of the asthma exacerbation cycle.",,Gene L Colice

These are generally uncomplicated infections except for occasional cases of otitis media or sinusitis. In individuals with asthma, however, HRV infections can have a major impact on disease development and progression. HRV-induced wheezing illnesses in early life are a significant risk factor for subsequent development of asthma, and growing evidence supports a role of recurrent HRV infections in the development and progression of several aspects of airway remodeling in asthma. In addition, HRV infections are one of the most common triggers for acute exacerbations of asthma, which represent a major burden to health-care systems around the world. None of the currently prescribed medications for asthma are effective in preventing or reversing asthma development and airway remodeling or are ideal for treating HRV-induced exacerbations of asthma. Thus, a better understanding of the role of HRV in asthma is important if we are to develop more effective therapies. In the past decade, we have gained new insights into the role of HRV infections in the development and progression of airway remodeling as well as a new appreciation for the proinflammatory and host defense responses to HRV infections that may help to regulate susceptibility to asthma exacerbations.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17115010/,Anaesthetic management in asthma,"Anaesthetic management in asthmatic patients has been focused on avoiding bronchoconstriction and inducing bronchodilation. However, the definition of asthma has changed over the past decade. Asthma has been defined as a clinical syndrome characterized by an inflammatory process that extends beyond the central airways to the distal airways and lung parenchyma. With this concept in mind, and knowing that asthma is a common disorder with increasing prevalence rates and severity worldwide, a rational choice of anaesthetic agents and procedures is mandatory. Thus, we pursued an update on the pharmacologic and technical anaesthetic approach for the asthmatic patient. When feasible, regional anaesthesia should be preferred because it reduces airway irritation and postoperative complications. If general anaesthesia is unavoidable, a laryngeal mask airway is safer than endotracheal intubation. Lidocaine inhalation, alone or combined with albuterol, minimizes histamine-induced bronchoconstriction. Propofol and ketamine inhibit bronchoconstriction, decreasing the risk of bronchospasm during anaesthesia induction. Propofol yields central airway dilation and is more reliable than etomidate or thiopental. Halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane are potent bronchodilators and can be helpful even in status asthmaticus. Sevoflurane has shown controversial results in asthmatic patients. Vecuronium, rocuronium, cisatracurium, and pancuronium do not induce bronchospasm, while atracurium and mivacurium can dose-dependently release histamine and should be cautiously administered in those patients. Further knowledge about the sites of action of anaesthetic agents in the lung, allied with our understanding of asthma pathophysiology, will establish the best anaesthetic approach for people with asthma.",,S M Burburan;D G Xisto;P R M Rocco

Many risk factors can help predict persistent disease, including presence of allergies or eczema, family history, symptoms apart from obvious infection, and the severity of previous episodes. Because neither cure nor prevention is currently a viable option, the treatment is aimed at minimizing symptoms and maximizing asthma control.",,Lora J Stewart

We conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the phenotypic differences between early-onset asthma (EOA) and late-onset asthma (LOA) in elderly patients. We collected clinical and physiological data from 176 elderly patients with asthma. Participants were divided into two groups: EOA group and LOA group. Demographics, comorbidities, inflammatory parameters, lung function, severity, asthma control, and medication use among EOA and LOA elderly patients were compared. Elderly subjects with EOA had more atopic disease, a stronger positive family history of asthma, higher IgE, and exhaled nitric oxide levels as compared to those with LOA. In contrast, elderly subjects with LOA had lower lung function and more marked fixed airflow obstruction (FAO). Elderly subjects with LOA had a higher incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). No differences were observed in age, gender, BMI, history of smoking, severity, and asthma control between the two groups. Both similarities and differences exist between elderly subjects with EOA and those with LOA in China. Further work is required to determine the pathophysiological, clinical, and therapeutic implications for different asthma phenotypes in elderly subjects.",,Qin-Hua Liu;Xu Kan;Yong Bin Wang;Kai-Xiong Liu;Dunhuang Zeng
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25855917/,Can we modulate asthma maintenance treatment level with disease seasonal variations?,"Asthma can have clinical seasonal fluctuations due to different exposure factors. The analysis of our data and literature confirm a seasonal trend of asthma severity. In this brief review, authors discuss the possibility to adapt maintenance therapy level to clinical seasonal fluctuations, by increasing treatment in some seasons to prevent exacerbations and by decreasing it in others, when symptoms are low, in order to minimize costs and maximize safety. Literature and our data (concerning studies carried out in areas with a temperate climate) indicate that asthma severity is reduced in summer while it tends to increase in the other seasons. Authors conclude that a preventive increasing maintenance treatment level during the season when we know that patients worsen (starting some weeks before symptom worsening) may reduce asthma exacerbation risks. On the contrary, a summer treatment reduction, in patients that improve during this period, may be considered only in asthma phenotypes with a benign disease course in time.",,B Sposato;M Scalese;G Moschini;M G Migliorini

The diagnosis of asthma is based on such clinical features as variable airflow obstruction that is partially if not fully reversible and airway hyperresponsiveness that predisposes to episodic bronchospasm following exposure to a variety of triggers. The underlying inflammation and airway biology of asthma is heterogeneous and is part of the explanation for the variable response to therapy. New biologics that help to characterize patients according to their underlying biology will aid in making better choices for treatment.

Available at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/ asthma/asthgdln.pdf). Subsequently, the NAEPP Expert Panel identified key questions regarding asthma management that were submitted to an evidence practice center of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to conduct a systematic review of the evidence. The resulting evidence report was used by the Expert Panel to update recommendations for clinical practice on selected topics. These recommendations (EPR-Update 2002) were published in 2002. (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Asthma Education and Prevention Program. Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma--update on selected topics 2002. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2002;110[November 2002, part 2]. Available at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma/index.htm). To improve the implementation of these guidelines, a working group of the Professional Education Subcommittee of the NAEPP extracted key clinical activities that should be considered as essential for quality asthma care in accordance with the EPR-2 guidelines and the EPR-Update 2002. The purpose was to develop a report that would help purchasers and planners of health care define the activities that are important to quality asthma care, particularly in reducing symptoms and preventing exacerbations, and subsequently reducing the overall national burden of illness and death from asthma. This report is intended to help employer health benefits managers and other health-care planners make decisions regarding delivery of health care for persons with asthma. Although this report is based on information directed to clinicians; it is not intended to substitute for recommended clinical practices for caring for persons with asthma, nor is it intended to replace the clinical decision-making required to meet individual patient needs. Readers are referred to the EPR-2 for the full asthma guidelines regarding diagnosis and management of asthma or to the abstracted Practical Guide (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Asthma Education and Prevention Program.

The Czech Pneumology and Allergology Societies commissioned 10 experts to review the literature and create joint national guidelines for managing asthma, reflecting this heterogeneity. The aim was to develop an easy-to-use diagnostic strategy as a rational approach to the widening opportunities for the use of phenotype-targeted therapy. The guidelines were presented on websites for public comments by members of both the societies. The reviewers' comments contributed to creating the final version of the guidelines. The key hallmark of the diagnostic approach is the pragmatic concept, which assesses the presence of allergy and eosinophilia in each asthmatic patient. The guidelines define three clinically relevant asthma phenotypes: eosinophilic allergic asthma, eosinophilic nonallergic asthma and noneosinophilic nonallergic asthma. The resulting multifunctional classification describing the severity, level of control and phenotype is the starting point for a comprehensive treatment strategy. The level of control is constantly confronted with the intensity of the common stepwise pharmacotherapy, and the concurrently included phenotyping is essential for phenotype-specific therapy. The concept of the asthma approach with assessing the presence of eosinophilia and allergy provides a way for more precise diagnosis, which is a prerequisite for using widening options of personalized therapy.",allergy; asthma heterogeneity; eosinophilia; phenotype-specific therapy.,M Terl;V Sedlák;P Cap;R Dvořáková;V Kašák;T Kočí;B Novotna;E Seberova;P Panzner;V Zindr

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21488995/,Biomarkers of therapy responsiveness in asthma: pitfalls and promises,"Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide. There is a large inter-individual variability in response to asthma treatment. Most patients respond well to standard therapy; however, a small proportion of the patients remain symptomatic despite treatment with high dosages of corticosteroids. Uncontrolled asthma leads to a decreased quality of life. Therefore, it is important to identify individuals who will respond poorly to standard asthma medication, especially to standard maintenance therapy with inhaled corticosteroids, at an early stage. Response to anti-inflammatory therapy is generally monitored by the assessment of clinical symptoms, which only partially correlates with underlying airway inflammation. The identification of specific inflammatory biomarkers might help to guide treatment or predict a corticosteroid response more accurately. Some inflammatory biomarkers are already finding their way into clinical practice (e.g. fraction of nitric oxide in exhaled breath), whereas others are predominantly used as a research tool (e.g. profiles of volatile organic compounds). Currently, there is no inflammatory biomarker used in routine clinical practice to predict a corticosteroid response. More knowledge on the underlying biological mechanism(s) of heterogeneous therapeutic responses could help to identify novel biomarkers. This review will focus on inflammatory patterns and genetic variations that may underlie differences in treatment response in patients with asthma, and will provide an overview of inflammatory biomarkers that could potentially serve as response predictors.",,S J H Vijverberg;L Koenderman;E S Koster;C K van der Ent;J A M Raaijmakers;A-H Maitland-van der Zee

The characteristics of the test may vary as a function of the severity of the disease (concept of spectrum bias).

A total of 193 out of 219 (88.1%) children with asthma (aged 7-9 yrs) from 23 out of 24 (95.8%) schools completed the study. Intervention schools received a staff asthma-training session, advice on asthma policy, an emergency beta2-agonist inhaler with spacer and whole-class asthma workshops. Nonintervention schools received no asthma-related input. Intervention children required less general practitioner-prescribed preventer medication despite no differences in symptom control compared with the nonintervention asthmatic group. Increased peer knowledge of asthma may have mediated improved active quality of life in the intervention group, together with increased self-esteem in young females. Those females not receiving the intervention, but identified as being asthmatic within the classroom, and thus possibly stigmatised, reported decreased self-esteem. Lower self-esteem in young males was associated with pet ownership. No change was found in staff knowledge, the establishment of asthma policies or school absences which were low even before intervention.

This pessimism is totally unfounded. However, our therapeutic possibilities depend partly on a better understanding of the asthma syndrome. In the past, this condition may not have been recognised for what it is, that is to say a multi factorial syndrome resulting from the innate and the acquired, from specific (allergic) and/or non-specific factors. Undoubtedly, too much responsibility has been placed on the allergic factor in asthma. Although important, it has made us overlook the fact that, allergic or not, asthma is an inflammatory illness of the bronchi provoked by the liberation of mediators. The role of histamine has been well known for a long time and we now realise the importance of the actions of the metabolites of arachidonic acid (prostaglandins and thromboxanes on the one hand, leukotrienes on the other). The characteristics bronchial hyperreactivity observed in asthma may certainly be congenital but this factor may also be acquired as in professional and post-viral asthma. If bronchial asthma remains under-diagnosed and under-treated in France and in Europe it is due to the fact that the artificial distinction between paroxysmal (bronchitis called ""asthmatic""), and persistent (that is to say a so-called asthmatic illness), is is often maintained. There is no real ground for maintaining this distinction.

Increasing awareness and changing diagnostic habits make precise evaluation of epidemiologic trends difficult in the absence of a gold-standard test for asthma, and on a global basis uncertainty persists. Trends in prevalence in some populations (eg, immigrants, farming communities) suggest both adverse and beneficial effects of specific environmental factors. Although the effects of indoor allergens, dampness, and mold and of outdoor air pollutants, especially traffic related, have traditionally dominated risk-factor research, more recent epidemiologic and clinical studies have focused on metabolic and nutritional factors, including maternal obesity and vitamin D levels, mode of delivery and its effect on the infant microbiome, fetal and infant growth, the psychosocial environment, and medication use by mother and infant.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9510668/,Clinical evaluation of occupational asthma,"In this paper, the procedures in the assessment of occupational asthma (OA) are discussed. Only the most common subtype of OA is considered here, i.e. that in which symptoms appear after a latency period from the beginning of exposure. OA is characterized by variable bronchial obstruction, and variable bronchial hyperresponsiveness caused by specific agents inhaled at work. The clinical investigation of OA is a stepwise approach which includes a comprehensive history together with physiological and immunological studies. The first step is to identify symptoms and relate exposure at work to the presence in the workplace of substances known to provoke OA. The presence of bronchial asthma must then be confirmed; this is achieved by assessing the reversibility of bronchial obstruction and/or the presence of nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity and/or the presence of significant peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability. The relationship between work and symptoms may first be assessed by means of serial measurements of PEF and of nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity during periods at work and away from work. When the suspected agent is a high-molecular-weight (HMW) or a low-molecular-weight (LMW) agent known to act through an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated mechanism, skin tests and/or research for specific IgE should be performed. In case of sensitization, where a relationship between asthma and work has been demonstrated by means of serial monitoring of PEF, a diagnosis can be made.

Although interpretation and comparison between studies are hampered by the use of variable definitions of WRA and criteria for the diagnosis, as many as 20% of cases of new or aggravated adult asthma has important work-related factors. Thus, all asthmatic patients should be asked about their work, if their respiratory symptoms are worse when they work, or if a new job/exposure preceded the onset of symptoms. A series of longitudinal inception and apprentice cohort studies were undertaken to address significant weakness in the previous medical literature. These studies are just beginning to produce results, and provide strong evidence for asthma caused by exposure to specific occupational environments. They have begun to produce new understanding of the risk factors for developing OA, the natural history of OA and immune sensitization, and the existence of the healthy worker effect. New, non-invasive measures of airway inflammation have been developed with the potential for broad applications in the field of WRA. Although the measurement of exhaled NO and induced sputum analysis are primarily used as research tools, their place in clinical practice is likely to become clearer.

Assessment and appropriate treatment can prevent fatalities associated with asthma, especially in the home setting.",,L J Taylor

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1297369/,Diagnosis and treatment of asthma in children: usefulness of a review of medical records,"In order to tackle the problems of underdiagnosis and undertreatment of asthma in childhood general practitioners need to be aware of which children in their practices have or might have asthma. In an effort to identify a cohort of asthmatic or potentially asthmatic children a trained audit facilitator studied all the medical records of children aged between one year and 15 years who were registered with 12 Tayside general practices. From a total of 10,685 medical records the frequency of 'key items' sometimes associated with asthma were as follows: one or more episodes of bronchospasm or wheeze 23.7% of children, persistent cough 23.2%, treatment with anti-asthma therapy in the past 20.0%, exercise induced cough or wheeze 5.2% and history of 'wheezy bronchitis' 4.6%. However, in only 896 children (8.4%) had a formal diagnosis of asthma been made. Of all the children, 5.4% had received a prescription for anti-asthma medication within the past three months. Only 1.2% were taking an inhaled corticosteroid and 1.0% sodium cromoglycate, but many more were taking inhaled bronchodilators (3.1%) and oral bronchodilators (1.7%). The findings suggest that a systematic review of medical records by a trained facilitator can identify those children who could benefit from clinical review. Practices who wish to know which of their children have or might have asthma should consider using medical record review to search for key items associated with asthma.",,R G Neville;F P Bryce;F M Robertson;I K Crombie;R A Clark
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25597198/,Improving the management of asthma in adults in primary care,"Studies in adult patients have suggested that 30% of those diagnosed with asthma do not have the condition and it is likely that the diagnosis is missed in many others. Initial clinical assessment should explore symptoms of wheeze, breathlessness, chest tightness and cough. The probability of asthma is increased if more than one of these symptoms is present and particularly if symptoms are worse at night and in the early morning or are exacerbated by triggers such as exercise, allergen exposure, cold air or drugs. The BTS/SIGN guideline advocates spirometry after taking the history. If airflow obstruction is present, a trial of treatment can commence, but a firm diagnosis also requires a symptomatic response and an improvement in the measured airflow obstruction. The FeNO level correlates well with airway inflammation, and is therefore a good indicator of asthma and in particular of the likely response to inhaled corticosteroids. The test is especially useful for patients with suggestive symptoms but normal spirometry. The cornerstone of asthma monitoring is a structured clinical review conducted in primary care on at least an annual basis. Health outcomes are improved by education in self-management, incorporating written personalised asthma action plans. Checking concordance with existing therapies and inhaler technique before escalating treatment is an important part of improving the pharmacological management of asthma. Any patient prescribed more than one short-acting bronchodilator device a month should be identified and have their asthma assessed urgently and measures taken to improve overall control.",,Wendy Funston;Bernard Higgins

Therapeutic effectiveness was measured by large airway changes in respiratory function, and the number of recurrent asthmatic attacks. The psychotherapeutic modes used were Relaxation Training, Assertive Training, and combined Relaxation plus Assertive Training. All patients were administered medication by the responsible physician. The group psychotherapy experiences were controlled by using patients who received medication alone and by patients who received medication and met in a leaderless group. The effectiveness of the therapeutic interventions was determined by comparisons between pretreatment measures and measurements taken during and after the eight-week treatment program. Both Relaxation Training by itself and combined Relaxation plus Assertive Training increased respiratory functioning and reduced the number of attacks. Assertive Training alone failed to improve respiratory function and had a tendency to increase the frequency of asthmatic attacks. It was concluded that the most effective management in male asthmatic children was achieved by the combination of medical and psychological treatments.",,R A Hock;C H Rodgers;C Reddi;D W Kennard

Serial observations before and after development of symptoms,"Four workers from a cedar sawmill who developed red cedar asthma are described. They had serial measurements of lung function and nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness (NSBH) several years before and after the development of chest symptoms. Measurements of dust concentration and specific IgE antibodies to plicatic acid-human serum albumin (PA-HSA) conjugate were also carried out before the onset of disease. NSBH developed in parallel with the development of asthma and was not present in any of the workers beforehand, indicating that it is not a predisposing host factor. Nasal symptoms preceded chest symptoms in three workers, suggesting that this may be an early marker of the disease. Although dust concentrations for jobs located both inside and outside the sawmill were low, jobs associated with somewhat higher exposures were associated with the initiation of asthma symptoms.",,M Chan-Yeung;A Desjardins
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9422630/,Gastroesophageal reflux and asthma,"The medical literature has been deluged with articles on the relation between gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and asthma. In an effort to piece together the complex puzzle, investigators from all disciplines have gathered their patients with wheezing and heartburn and studied the epidemiology, the possible cause or effect mechanisms and the therapeutic response to GER treatment. Indeed, since humans first began to hunker down and work together to discuss interesting observations, the world has begun to breathe easier. Epidemiological evidence for a GER/asthma association suggests that about three-fourths of asthmatics, independent of the use of bronchodilators, have acid GER, increased frequency of reflux episodes, or heartburn; and 40% have reflux esophagitis. Physiological studies suggest that 2 separate mechanisms are involved in the GER/asthma relationship: (1) a vagally mediated pathway and (2) microaspiration. In any given patient, however, there is no acceptable diagnostic method available to confirm the presence or absence of GER-induced asthma. Clinical trials, using antireflux medical therapy and antireflux surgery have begun to provide some clues about GER-related pulmonary symptoms. The trials of medical therapy using acid suppressing drugs (e.g. histamine-2 receptor antagonists) have ranged from no benefit to modest improvement of only nocturnal asthma symptoms. Studies with proton-pump inhibitors are underway. In uncontrolled surgical studies, antireflux surgery has resulted in partial or complete remission of asthma symptoms in a large proportion of patients. Despite the uncontrolled nature of these studies, many patients have had dramatic subjective improvement in pulmonary symptoms. It appears for now that clinical trials are the only available means to assess whether medical or surgical treatment of GER in patients with both GER and asthma improves the symptoms of asthma and decreases the need for pulmonary medications. One conclusion is certain: We no longer can ignore the important co-existent nature of these 2 afflictions.",,S J Sontag

While much is known about asthma morbidity, there are few available data on the economic burden of this condition, particularly in underdeveloped countries. In the absence of data on social costs, it is not possible to develop rational approaches to policies regarding resource allocation to reduce morbidity. The purpose of this article is to provide a review of the available literature on the social costs of illness for asthma. In light of this literature, we propose a conceptual model that links asthma morbidity to the social opportunity costs of the disease. We then delineate a framework, based on the proposed model, that can be used to conceptualise and evaluate the relative impact of alternative asthma intervention strategies. Based upon proposed analyses using this model, we believe that it would be possible to compare how various intervention strategies are likely to affect asthma costs and morbidity, thus providing a means for a more rational approach to healthcare policies regarding societal resource allocation for asthma.",,K B Weiss;S D Sullivan
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26382999/,Risk factors for asthma: is prevention possible?,"Asthma is one of the most common diseases in the world, resulting in a substantial burden of disease. Although rates of deaths due to asthma worldwide have reduced greatly over the past 25 years, no available therapeutic regimens can cure asthma, and the burden of asthma will continue to be driven by increasing prevalence. The reasons for the increase in asthma prevalence have not been defined, which limits the opportunities to develop targeted primary prevention measures. Although associations are reported between a wide range of risk factors and childhood asthma, substantiation of causality is inherently difficult from observational studies, and few risk factors have been assessed in primary prevention studies. Furthermore, none of the primary prevention intervention strategies that have undergone scrutiny in randomised controlled trials has provided sufficient evidence to lead to widespread implementation in clinical practice. A better understanding of the factors that cause asthma is urgently needed, and this knowledge could be used to develop public health and pharmacological primary prevention measures that are effective in reducing the prevalence of asthma worldwide. To achieve this it will be necessary to think outside the box, not only in terms of risk factors for the causation of asthma, but also the types of novel primary prevention strategies that are developed, and the research methods used to provide the evidence base for their implementation. In the interim, public health efforts should remain focused on measures with the potential to improve lung and general health, such as: reducing tobacco smoking and environmental tobacco smoke exposure; reducing indoor and outdoor air pollution and occupational exposures; reducing childhood obesity and encouraging a diet high in vegetables and fruit; improving feto-maternal health; encouraging breastfeeding; promoting childhood vaccinations; and reducing social inequalities.",,Richard Beasley;Alex Semprini;Edwin A Mitchell

Therapeutic response of severe asthmatics can be predicted by the use of biomarkers of Type2-high or Type2-low inflammation. Based on sputum cell analysis, four inflammatory phenotypes have been described. As induced sputum is timeconsuming and expensive technique, surrogate biomarkers are useful in clinical practice. Eosinophilic phenotype is likely to reflect ongoing adaptive immunity in response to allergen. Several biomarkers of eosinophilic asthma are easily available in clinical practice (blood eosinophils, serum IgE, exhaled nitric oxyde, serum periostin). Neutrophilic asthma is thought to reflect innate immune system activation in response to pollutants or infectious agents while paucigranulocytic asthma is thought to be not inflammatory and characterized by smooth muscle dysfunction.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1628255/,Can fatal asthma be prevented?--a personal view,"An increase in the mortality rate from asthma in several countries has been observed in recent years, notwithstanding the great improvement in pathophysiological findings and the introduction of new effective therapeutic agents. The phenomenon is difficult to explain but the causes of death and identification of high-risk patients have been widely studied. It is suggested that the most vital aim for physicians is the avoidance of those factors which may contribute to death from asthma. These are particularly: inadequate assessment of its severity by patients, general practitioners and hospital doctors, and inadequate and inappropriate treatment. From the diagnostic point of view, the measurement of airflow rates is necessary to establish the diagnosis in terms of reversibility, quantify the severity and assess the response to therapy. The different entity of reversibility of bronchial obstruction is due to the various mechanisms intervening in different patients. After adequate treatment, according to our observations, the reversibility is more complete in young people and when the duration of the disease is less than 2 years. Trigger factors must also be considered. From the therapeutic point of view, considering that the most important alteration in asthma is the inflammation of bronchial structures with intervention of several inflammatory cells and of numerous different chemical mediators, physicians have to apply treatment aimed at reducing inflammation rather than relying on symptomatic bronchodilator remedies. Treatment should be divided into three phases, according to symptoms: induction, consolidation and maintenance. Finally, on the basis of data here presented and of clinical experience, the essential measures for the prevention of asthma mortality are reported. If general practitioners take them into account, deaths from asthma will be reduced to a minimum.",,U Serafini

The key elements are the history of the disease and the measurements of peak expiratory flow (PEF). The characteristic of asthma is variability. A history of chest symptoms that are variable is typical of asthma. Demonstrating a variation of PEF > or = 20% establishes a definite diagnosis of asthma. This variability is demonstrated either, in patients with normal PEF when they are well, by measuring a decrease in PEF during a period when the patient has symptoms of asthma or, in patients with PEF < normal, an improvement after inhalation of salbutamol or after a period of treatment. Classifying the severity of asthma is also based on history and lung function measurement. Patients with PEF <60% or continuous symptoms are classified as severe persistent. Those with PEF 60-79% or daily symptoms (not continuous) are classified as moderate persistent. Those with symptoms more than once per week but less than daily and PEF > or = 80% are classified as mild persistent. Those with symptoms less than once per week and PEF > or = 80% are classified as intermittent. Establishing the diagnosis and assessing the severity are crucial to high quality care.",,N Aït-Khaled;D A Enarson

Diagnosis may be difficult in the young child, symptomatology most often occurring following a viral infection. It is important not to ignore a foreign body in the airways or fibrocystic disease and asthma remains, particularly in infants, a diagnosis of elimination. Misdiagnosis or insufficient treatment of asthma may risk the development of irreversible histological lesions and also could compromise pulmonary growth and the child's lung reserve. Spacer devices and nebulisers enable inhaled therapy to be administered to very young children. The value of early diagnosis is to institute appropriate treatment notably in severe asthma with inhaled corticosteroid therapy, the aim being to reduce remodelling lesions of the airways. The minimal effective dose should be defined to minimalize side-effects. The treatment of asthma is not restricted to pharmacotherapy: attempts should be made to reduce intercurrent viral infections, domestic pollution (including smoking) and allergenic concentrations.

When encountering a wheezing dyspneic patient who does not report such a history, it behooves the physician to entertain the possibility that the patient may have a disease other than asthma. Chronic bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema, cardiogenic pulmonary edema pulmonary emboli, aspiration of gastric contents, and upper airway obstruction are the common causes of nonasthmatic wheezing.

Nevertheless, the role of viral infections in the pathogenesis of asthma remains poorly characterized. The factors that could explain this association are heterogeneous and sometimes contradictory. The four main causative mechanisms implicated in the association between viral respiratory infections and the subsequent development of asthma or wheezing in children are alterations in airway function and size, dysregulation (congenital and acquired) of airway tone, alterations in the immune response to infections, and the genetic variants involved in immune response.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2688495/,Allergic etiology and immunology of asthma,"Although asthma is a complex and multifactorial disease, a relationship between atopic allergic sensitization to common aeroallergens and asthma has been recognized for decades. This recognition has not led to a widespread immunologic orientation to asthma diagnosis and treatment. This review summarizes older epidemiologic evidence using historical data and skin tests that associate IgE-mediated events with asthma, and presents more recent studies utilizing in vitro testing to study new subject groups, to demonstrate that in certain situations up to 75% to 100% of the cases of chronic asthma, as well as many acute episodes, have an allergic etiology. Thus the old distinctions between intrinsic and extrinsic asthma should be discarded in favor of an aggressive search for allergic factors in virtually any patient with asthma. A theoretic basis for the allergic etiology of asthma has arisen from recent studies linking (1) IgE antibody production with cytophilic sensitization of mast cells and possibly other proinflammatory cell types bearing IgE receptors; (2) IgE-dependent, allergen-induced immediate bronchial reactions with late-phase reactions; and (3) occurrence of late-phase reactions with persistent local inflammation and increased nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity. Understanding of the allergic etiology of asthma in turn gives rise to renewed emphasis upon immunomodulatory approaches to treatment. At present these include allergen avoidance measures that reduce natural exposure and conventional high-dose allergen injection immunotherapy, both of which have well-documented efficacy when properly applied. In the future, better understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of asthma, in particular the events of the late-phase reaction, are likely to lead to new approaches to treatment based upon rational modulation of these events, possibly with recombinant cytokine-based therapy or synthetic peptide antagonists of defined mediator molecules.",,R B Moss

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8658386/,Prognostic factors for the outcome of childhood asthma in adolescence,"By the second decade of life asthma symptoms often abate and it may seem that patients with mild asthma have ""outgrown"" the disease. Unfortunately this is likely to be the exception rather than the rule. Although the severity of asthma symptoms fluctuates with time, the inherited tendency towards respiratory symptoms never disappears and many teenagers who seem to be free of symptoms do, in fact, have persistent asthma. During symptom-free periods subclinical, but nevertheless significant, airways obstruction and/or bronchial hyperresponsiveness may be present. It is not unusual for adults who have been asymptomatic for a number of years to redevelope asthma symptoms. Indeed, much of the so-called adult onset asthma has its roots in childhood. Levison concluded that, in these subjects, it is often not the asthma that is outgrown but the paediatrician. The more severe asthma is in childhood the more likely it is that the disease will persist in adulthood. A complete list of the characteristics of the disease in childhood, and the potential risk factors associated with an unfavourable prognosis, such as pulmonary function and bronchial responsiveness and markers of airway inflammation, is therefore needed. As properly matched and controlled prospective long term studies have not been published it has not been possible to evaluate the effects on prognosis of any single class of antiasthma agent. Such studies are needed to find out if it is possible to alter the natural history of the disease. In theory modern asthma treatments, because they are able to improve symptoms and underlying disease phenomena, are also beneficial in the long term prognosis of childhood asthma. The majority of patients with persistent asthma included in the currently available studies were not receiving adequate treatment. Since compliance with therapeutic regimens in asthma, especially in adolescence, is low, a monitoring system is needed to guarantee adequate follow up and treatment during and beyond puberty.",,R J Roorda

The aim of this study was to analyze data on disease management of a paediatric population with a hospitalization for asthma. The study population comprised 6-17 year old subjects belonging to three local health units of the Lombardy Region, northern Italy. Regional administrative databases were used to collect data on: the number of children with an incident hospitalization for asthma during the 2004-2006 period, anti-asthma therapy, specialist visit referrals, and claims for spirometry, released in the 12 months before and after hospitalization. Each patient's asthma management profile was compared with GINA guideline recommendations. Among the 183 hospitalized subjects, 101 (55%) received therapy before hospitalization and 82 (45%) did not. 10% did not receive any therapy either before or after hospital admission and in 13% the therapy was discontinued afterward. Based on GINA guidelines, asthma management adhered to recommendations only for 55% of subjects. Results may suggest that for half of hospitalized subjects, inaccurate diagnosis, under-treatment/scarce compliance with asthma guidelines by physicians, and/or scarce compliance to therapy by patients/their parents occurred. In all these cases, hospitalization would be a proxy indicator of preventable poor control of disease, rather than a proxy indicator of severity.",,Marina Bianchi;Antonio Clavenna;Marco Sequi;Angela Bortolotti;Ida Fortino;Luca Merlino;Maurizio Bonati

Two-third or more gave correct responses to questions on aetiology and pathogenesis, pathophysiology, symptomatology, precipitants and outcome of asthma. A control group of parents of 110 children admitted to the hospital with minor surgical complaints performed equally well on the knowledge questions, except for four sub-questions: (1) allergy as an aetiologic factor in asthma (64.5% vs 83.6%, P = 0.002), (2) constriction of airways as a bodily change during an asthmatic attack (75.4% vs 91.3%, P = 0.004), (3) cough as a symptom of asthma (82.7% vs 99.2%, P less than 0.001) and (4) change in weather (81.0% vs 95.5%, P = 0.002) or cold weather (60.9% vs 74.2%, P = 0.015) as triggers of asthma. However, a significant minority of both groups of parents were found to harbour misconceptions about asthma. Between 10-20% believed that poor care, inappropriate diet during pregnancy or premature birth can predispose a child to asthma. About one-third believed that bodily changes during an asthmatic attack include loss of control or paralysis of chest muscles, infection of lungs and compression of the lungs by the stomach. Also about one-third believed that swallowing a hard object or touching a poisonous plant can set off an asthmatic attack.

Those that fail to respond are a heterogeneous group. We propose that the nature and type of any steroid-resistant inflammation, the extent of any persistent airflow limitation and the extent of bronchial hyper-reactivity should be determined separately to allow a rational treatment approach to these children, rather than the haphazard advice of many current guidelines. Reasons for persistent difficult asthma include persistent eosinophilic inflammation, non-eosinophilic inflammation, airway reactivity without residual inflammation and persistent airflow limitation. We propose a protocol that uses non-invasive and invasive (bronchoscopic) methods to document the response to systemic steroids (depot triamcinolone). The aim of the protocol is to determine an individualised treatment plan; for example, cyclosporin for persistent eosinophilic inflammation, azithromycin for persistent neutrophilic inflammation and continuous subcutaneous terbutaline if there is airway reactivity without residual inflammation.

Asthma is frequently overlooked in the geriatric population. Objective measures of pulmonary function can aid in a prompt diagnosis and lead to effective treatment and improved quality of life. Because smoking is an important risk factor for asthma-like symptoms of wheezing, cough, and sputum production, asthma is frequently confused with COPD. When airflow obstruction is found, attempts to demonstrate reversibility can uncover an asthmatic component to the disease. In patients who have asthma symptoms and no airflow obstruction, methacholine testing is helpful. When a normal methacholine challenge is present, a diagnosis of asthma can be excluded and the physician can pursue other diagnostic considerations such as heart failure, chronic aspiration syndrome, pulmonary embolic disease, and carcinoma of the lung. The onset of wheezing, shortness of breath, and cough in an elderly patient is likely to cause concern.

Little information is available relating to the costs of asthma depending on the degree of severity of the disease. Total, direct and indirect costs generated by asthma patients who sought medical care for asthma control over a one-year period in a northern area of Spain were determined. Data were obtained from the patients themselves and severity of illness was classified into mild, moderate and severe according to the International Consensus Report on Diagnosis and Treatment of Asthma, 1992. The average total annual asthma-derived cost was estimated at US$2,879 per patient, with averages of US$1,336 in mildly asthmatic patients, US$2,407 in moderate asthma and US$6,393 in severe asthma. At all levels of severity, indirect costs were twice as high as direct costs, and at the same degree of severity, direct costs due to medication and hospitalization were higher among females than males. A minority of severe asthmatics incurred some 41% of the total costs. The cost of asthma was surprisingly high and varied substantially depending on the degree of severity of the disease.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25893310/,Diagnosis and management of asthma in preschoolers: A Canadian Thoracic Society and Canadian Paediatric Society position paper,"Asthma often starts before six years of age. However, there remains uncertainty as to when and how a preschool-age child with symptoms suggestive of asthma can be diagnosed with this condition. This delays treatment and contributes to both short- and long-term morbidity. Members of the Canadian Thoracic Society Asthma Clinical Assembly partnered with the Canadian Paediatric Society to develop a joint working group with the mandate to develop a position paper on the diagnosis and management of asthma in preschoolers. In the absence of lung function tests, the diagnosis of asthma should be considered in children one to five years of age with frequent (≥ 8 days/month) asthma-like symptoms or recurrent (≥ 2) exacerbations (episodes with asthma-like signs). The diagnosis requires the objective document of signs or convincing parent-reported symptoms of airflow obstruction (improvement in these signs or symptoms with asthma therapy), and no clinical suspicion of an alternative diagnosis. The characteristic feature of airflow obstruction is wheezing, commonly accompanied by difficulty breathing and cough. Reversibility with asthma medications is defined as direct observation of improvement with short-acting ß2-agonists (SABA) (with or without oral corticosteroids) by a trained health care practitioner during an acute exacerbation (preferred method). However, in children with no wheezing (or other signs of airflow obstruction) on presentation, reversibility may be determined by convincing parental report of a symptomatic response to a three-month therapeutic trial of a medium dose of inhaled corticosteroids with as-needed SABA (alternative method), or as-needed SABA alone (weaker alternative method). The authors provide key messages regarding in whom to consider the diagnosis, terms to be abandoned, when to refer to an asthma specialist and the initial management strategy.

This heterogeneity calls attention to the importance of assessing asthma control and adjusting treatment accordingly.

Numerous children, however, develop disease that is persistent throughout their lifetimes and is associated with more severe symptoms, increased airway reactivity, and loss of lung function. These children typically have a family history of asthma and demonstrate increased airways reactivity and atopy in childhood. A clearer picture of the natural history of asthma in the developing child has been derived from the results of several longitudinal studies. Although some questions have been clarified, several questions still remain. Now that the incidence and severity of asthma seem to be increasing, children born in the last 10 years may experience more severe disease or a different pathophysiology than those born 30 to 40 years ago. New cohort studies are needed to assess this possibility. Additional investigations into the genetics of asthma causation will help elucidate the different phenotypic expressions of this complex disease.

Conversely, asthma can lead to worsening reflux both through the use of smooth muscle relaxing anti-asthma medication and by the mechanical effects of hyperinflation reducing lower oesophageal sphincter pressures. The effects on asthma following treatment of reflux has been anecdotally reported to be successful in some individuals, particularly those with severe reflux, but surgery should be reserved for individuals only after failure of medical treatment and should be aimed at improving reflux symptoms rather than improving asthma control.",,J G Ayres;J F Miles

The knowledge of the various clinical asthma phenotypes is very important as regards the appropriate treatment approach, and the prognostic assessment of the patients with asthma. This allows a better understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms, and of the phenotype-genotype correlation. A diagrammatic classification of clinical asthma phenotypes includes following criteria: onset age, inflammatory profile, severity pattern. According to the onset age, asthma clinical phenotypes specific for children and clinical phenotypes more frequent in adulthood are known. The main childhood asthma phenotypes are: transient infant wheezing, non atopic wheezing of the toddler and early school years, persistent IgE-mediated wheezing/asthma, late-onset childhood asthma. Other asthma phenotypes like aspirin-induced asthma, asthma related to chronic, persistent respiratory infection, are rare in childhood. It is reported a prevalence of 2-5% for the aspirin-induced asthma among pediatric patients. According to the airway inflammation pattern there are two phenotypes to distinguish: eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic asthma.

Seven of the Centers for Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research (Children's Centers), funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, conducted studies relating to asthma. The design of these studies was diverse and included cohorts, longitudinal studies of older children, and intervention trials involving asthmatic children. In addition to the general lessons provided regarding the conduct of clinical studies in both urban and rural populations, these studies provide important lessons regarding the successful conduct of community research addressing asthma. They demonstrate that it is necessary and feasible to conduct repeated evaluation of environmental exposures in the home to address environmental exposures relevant to asthma. The time and staff required were usually underestimated by the investigators, but through resourceful efforts, the studies were completed with a remarkably high completion rate. The definition of asthma and assessment of disease severity proved to be complex and required a combination of questionnaires, pulmonary function tests, and biologic samples for markers of immune response and disease activity. The definition of asthma was particularly problematic in younger children, who may exhibit typical asthma symptoms sporadically with respiratory infections without developing chronic asthma. Medications confounded the definition of asthma disease activity, and must be repeatedly and systematically estimated. Despite these many challenges, the Children's Centers successfully conducted long-term studies of asthma.",,Peyton A Eggleston;Greg Diette;Michael Lipsett;Toby Lewis;Ira Tager;Rob McConnell;Elizabeth Chrischilles;Bruce Lanphear;Rachel Miller;Jerry Krishnan
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21761959/,Managed care opportunities for improving asthma care,"Uncontrolled asthma is an enormous burden in terms of the propensity to reach asthma control in the future, direct and indirect costs, and health-related quality of life. The complex pathophysiology, treatment, and triggers of asthma warrant a unified, yet targeted, approach to care. No single factor is fully responsible for poor control. Complicating the problem of asthma control is adherence to long-term controller medications. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) established several key points for asthma control, and developed classifications for asthma control and recommended actions for treatment. All parties involved in the management of asthma, including physicians, pharmacists, nurses, patients, family members, and insurance companies, need to be aware of the NAEPP guidelines. To determine if the goals of asthma therapy are being met, assessment of asthma outcomes is necessary. Unfortunately, some measures may get overlooked, and patient-reported outcomes (as assessed by the validated control instruments) are not often collected during routine examinations. The Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set measure for asthma may be used to quantify asthma care, but there is evidence that it does not fully capture the goals of asthma management. Most well-designed, education-based interventions are considered good value for money, but it can be difficult to put into practice such policy interventions. An optimal managed care plan will adhere to known evidence-based guidelines, can measure outcomes, is targeted to the patient's risk and impairment, and can adapt to changes in our understanding of asthma and its treatment.",,Jonathan D Campbell

Attacks more frequent than one every week; 2. attacks lasting for more than one day; 3. six or more hospitalizations; 4. absence from school exceeding one month per school-year; 5. drop-out from school for at least one school-year; 6. steroid treatment for more than one week. 59 patients (13.3%) fulfilled the criteria. The sex ratio within the severe group was 1:1 although there was a male preponderance of all asthmatics. The recovery rate for the severe group was lower (40.6%) than for all patients (75.0%). Prognosis was less favourable in female than in male patients. In the severe group the disease appeared earlier, eczema during infancy occurred more frequently and allergic disorders had a higher incidence in the family than in the group as a whole. Chest deformities were observed in 48.7% of severe patients while its incidence was only 18.6% for all patients with asthma.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15384576/,Understanding the origin of asthma and its relationship to breastfeeding,"Asthma is a chronic disease of the lung that has been increasing at an alarming rate in industrialized countries around the world over the last few decades. Although considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of the disease, the exact causes of the increasing prevalence are unknown. Studies suggest that most asthma develops in early childhood and that environmental factors present early in life may be crucial in the development of disease. One potential explanation for the recent epidemic referred to as the ""hygiene hypothesis"" postulates that factors that have resulted in a reduction in exposure to microbial products and/or infections in the western world may be contributing to this rise in disease prevalence. As early life influences are known to play an important role in establishment of asthma, studies have focused on the interface between mother and child that occurs during gestation and through breastfeeding. In this regard, the body of evidence regarding the relationship between breastfeeding and asthma indicates benefit but with the potential for risk. While providing population-level protection from infections and atopy in infancy and early childhood, breastfeeding might also pose an increased risk of atopic asthma among children with asthmatic mothers.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1579137/,Asthma in children,"Despite advances in the understanding of asthma, there is still a high rate of morbidity and mortality from this disease in children. Although many factors are involved, a persistent concern is that the overuse of beta-agonists combined with the underuse of antiinflammatory medications leads to increased mortality. The demonstration that airway inflammation is present in mild asthma and the observations that inflammatory stimuli increase airway responsiveness have led to the use of antiinflammatory agents at earlier stages of disease. However, the medications with antiinflammatory activity that are currently available are not effective for all patients. The problems posed by chronic severe asthma in a child despite appropriate use of corticosteroids suggest that our current concepts are overly simplistic. Therefore, health care workers dealing with this disease must maintain an open mind about what constitutes optimal therapy.",,G L Larsen
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28814293/,Regulation of human airway smooth muscle cell migration and relevance to asthma,"Airway remodelling is an important feature of asthma pathogenesis. A key structural change inherent in airway remodelling is increased airway smooth muscle mass. There is emerging evidence to suggest that the migration of airway smooth muscle cells may contribute to cellular hyperplasia, and thus increased airway smooth muscle mass. The precise source of these cells remains unknown. Increased airway smooth muscle mass may be collectively due to airway infiltration of myofibroblasts, neighbouring airway smooth muscle cells in the bundle, or circulating hemopoietic progenitor cells. However, the relative contribution of each cell type is not well understood. In addition, although many studies have identified pro and anti-migratory agents of airway smooth muscle cells, whether these agents can impact airway remodelling in the context of human asthma, remains to be elucidated. As such, further research is required to determine the exact mechanism behind airway smooth muscle cell migration within the airways, how much this contributes to airway smooth muscle mass in asthma, and whether attenuating this migration may provide a therapeutic avenue for asthma. In this review article, we will discuss the current evidence with respect to the regulation of airway smooth muscle cell migration in asthma.",Airway smooth muscle; Asthma; Cytokines; Migration; Remodelling.,Brittany Salter;Cara Pray;Katherine Radford;James G Martin;Parameswaran Nair
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26929420/,Asthma in childhood,"Several topics on childhood asthma were addressed in the Paediatric Clinical Year in Review session at the 2015 European Respiratory Society International Congress. With regard to the relationship between lower respiratory tract infections and asthma, it emerges that is the number of respiratory episodes in the first years of life, but not the particular viral trigger, to be associated with later asthma development. Understanding which characteristics of individual patients are associated with an increased risk for asthma exacerbation is a critical step to implement strategies preventing these seasonal events. Recent data suggest the possibility that exhaled volatile organic compounds may qualify as biomarkers in detecting early signs of asthma. Adding information of exhaled volatile organic compounds and expression of inflammation genes to a clinical tool significantly improves asthma prediction in preschool wheezy children. Personal communication with children and adolescents is likely more important than the tools actually used for monitoring asthma. Systemic corticosteroids do not affect the long-term prognosis in children with first viral-induced wheezing episode and should be used cautiously during acute episodes. Finally, stress and a polymorphism upstream of a specific gene are both associated with reduced bronchodilator response in children with asthma.",,Fernando Maria de Benedictis;Marina Attanasi

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2688497/,Rational therapy of acute asthma,"Despite effective pharmacologic therapy, asthma remains a common cause of emergency room and hospital admissions, and mortality due to asthma is increasing. Asthma deaths often are related to failure on the part of patients or their physicians to appreciate the severity of their illness. Subjective assessment of the severity of airflow obstruction is unreliable and actual measurement of airflow and arterial blood gases should be utilized initially, as well as during therapy. An increasing awareness of the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of asthma has led to pharmacologic therapy aimed both at producing bronchodilation and at reducing inflammation. Aggressive therapy with inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists and systemic corticosteroids remains the mainstay of treatment for acute asthma. Some patients may benefit from the addition of anticholinergic therapy and/or theophylline. If mechanical ventilation is required, controlled hypoventilation may decrease the incidence of pulmonary barotrauma. Although inhaled corticosteroids, cromolyn sodium, antihistamines and calcium-channel blockers are not effective in the treatment of acute asthma, inhaled steroids should probably be used in the recovery phase of most hospitalized asthmatics to decrease the bronchial hyperreactivity associated with airway inflammation.",,S C Lazarus

In patients with asthma-like symptoms, spirometric evidence of airway obstruction plus a large bronchodilator response makes asthma much more likely. However, normal spirometry is common in patients with mild asthma who are not symptomatic at the time of testing, and patients with poorly controlled asthma may lack substantial bronchodilator response. Inhalation challenge test often helps confirm asthma in patients with normal spirometry. Adult smokers with intermittent respiratory symptoms may have either asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Normal post-bronchodilator spirometry rules out COPD. In patients with airway obstruction, a low diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide increases the probability of COPD and makes asthma much less likely.

However, the effect of early intervention using ICS in young children is considered controversial as several clinical studies have suggested that ICS does not alter the natural history of asthma in young children. Although there is limited and some negative evidence for the effect of ICS in young children, ICS remains the most effective medication for controlling asthma of the currently available drugs for all ages.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15578862/,Assessment of bronchial responsiveness following exposure to inhaled occupational and environmental agents,"Inhalation of a range of agents can result in airway inflammation and/or irritation. This may result in occupational asthma or reactive airways dysfunction syndrome. Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome follows a single large exposure to a chemical agent but is now frequently embraced under the wider term of irritant-induced asthma, a term that also includes asthma due to persistent, lower dose irritant exposures. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness is a hallmark of both occupational asthma and reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, although some patients with occupational asthma may occasionally have typical clinical features without increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Following removal of the causal agent in occupational asthma, bronchial hyperresponsiveness generally returns towards normal over a 2-year period, although some individuals demonstrate increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness for longer. Measurement of specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness to the primary causal agent in occupational asthma is used diagnostically but not for assessing prognosis. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness to inhaled methacholine can be measured across individual workshifts to assess work-related change. It may also be measured at the end of a work period when exposure has occurred, and compared with values following a period away from work. There have been no direct, systematic comparisons of changes in methacholine responsiveness in the diagnosis of occupational asthma compared with the more frequently used serial peak flow measurements. Patients with reactive airways dysfunction syndrome classically exhibit non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness, which can be readily measured by evaluating responses to inhaled methacholine. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness in reactive airways dysfunction syndrome can persist for many years after initial exposure and serial changes can be used to assess recovery and subsequent disability over time.",,Graeme P Currie;Jon G Ayres

In addition, there appear to be no published survey instruments specifically designed to gain insights into how the general public perceives asthma. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of such an instrument, the Chicago Community Asthma Survey (CCAS)-32. Development began with two qualitative steps. First, a review of the published literature guided the initial instrument construction (Step 1). Content domains were chosen based on clinical input and the Health Belief Model. Most items were derived from existing instruments. To assess content validity, cognitive interviews and expert reviews were conducted (Step 2). Items were added, modified, and deleted based on the information gathered at each of these steps. In the next step, item performance measurement (Step 3), testing of two samples provided quantitative data to further inform item reduction. Items with uniform correct responses or responses lacking in variability were excluded. The result of this three-step process was a 32-item survey of asthma knowledge, attitudes and perceptions, the CCAS-32. The introduction to the survey was subsequently modified to minimize respondent bias (Step 4). In conclusion, the CCAS-32 was constructed with input from experts in asthma and individuals from the Chicago area.

Methodological flaws have been indicated as a possible explanation for these inconsistencies. However, an alternative explanation is that the effects of genetic variants depend on other factors whose frequency and distribution vary, both across individuals and across populations. Within this framework, we review recent advances in asthma genetics and conclude that a paradigm shift is needed, because a static model in which the DNA sequence is associated with disease risk in a linear fashion fails to consider the interdependence of the diverse components of asthma risk.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17508964/,Assessment of asthma control and its impact on optimal treatment strategy,"Achieving and maintaining optimal asthma control is a major asthma management goal advocated by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). Recent evidence suggests that while asthma control is clearly achievable in most asthmatics, not all asthmatics attain optimal asthma control. The difficulty is compounded further because patients, physicians and regulatory bodies have different perceptions of what is meant by asthma control. The challenge therefore remains as to how best to assess asthma control and define management strategies to ensure that this control is achieved and maintained. Despite the availability of several patient-based tools for assessing asthma control, these are mostly employed in a research setting or in selected specialist clinics. A symptom-based treatment approach also may have its limitations because patients can be poor judges of disease symptoms and severity and under-estimation may lead to inadequate treatment of airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) when treatment is administered as on-demand reliever therapy, since the effect of treatment on these underlying features occurs over a longer time course. The clinical benefits of sustained maintenance treatment for at least 3 months has been documented in recent studies of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combination, which have demonstrated correlations between reduction in airway inflammation/AHR and reduction in exacerbation rates. In view of the putative limitations of a purely symptom-based asthma management plan, we suggest that treatment should be focussed on management of all aspects of the disease rather than management of symptoms alone, with a practical approach being treatment for a minimum of 3 months with an optimal dose to ensure maximal effects are seen on asthma control, airway inflammation, lung function, and remodelling.",,B Lundback;R Dahl

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19711772/,The role of alternative and complementary treatments of asthma,"Asthma is one of the leading chronic diseases of our times, with millions of sufferers worldwide and can be defined as a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that is temporarily reversible either spontaneously or by treatment. Although there are many allopathic treatments including bronchodilators and corticosteroids, which either focuses on long-term control or immediate relief, there is no single medication that is effective against both the inflammatory and bronchoconstrictive components of asthma. Therefore, many sufferers turn to alternative or complementary therapies, typically in conjunction with their regular allopathic medications. The current short communication briefly reviews the disease and investigates the types of alternative and complementary treatments available to asthma sufferers. It is concluded that therapies like acupuncture, yoga, Tai Chi Chuan and hypnosis are used by many asthma patients but it seems as if many patients do not communicate the use of such therapies to their medical practitioners. Results from documented research, however, show alternative therapies for the treatment of asthma have a role to play and are effective to alleviate symptoms.

The evidence showing inflammation and remodelling in distal airways, and their possible involvement in asthma control and natural history, was reviewed. The usefulness and limitations of various techniques used for assessing distal airways were also evaluated, including pulmonary function tests and imaging. Finally, the available data studying the benefit of treatment better targeting distal airways in asthma was examined. It was concluded that both proximal and distal airways were involved in asthma and that distal airways were the major determinant of airflow obstruction. Inflammation in distal airways appeared more intense in severe and uncontrolled asthma. Distal airways were poorly attained by conventional aerosol of asthma medications owing to their granulometry, being composed of 3-5&emsp14;μm particles.

This hypothesis has evolved in various ways exploring the role of overt viral and bacterial infections, the significance of environmental exposure to microbial compounds, and their effect on underlying responses of innate and adaptive immunity. So far a truly unifying concept is still lacking, but various pieces of a complex interplay between a host's immune response, characteristics of the invading microorganism, the level and variety of the environmental exposure, and the interactions between a genetic background and a range of exposures become apparent. All these pieces eventually assemble to the clinical presentation of a complex syndrome namely of asthma and allergic illnesses. Even if today practical implications cannot directly be deduced from these findings, there is great potential for the development of novel preventive and therapeutic strategies in the future based on the concepts of the 'hygiene hypothesis'.",,Erika von Mutius

Numerous historical and prospective cohort studies have investigated the effects of maternal asthma on pregnancy outcome; however, the data has been conflicting and many studies have not used standard classifications for asthma severity. Overall, the literature suggests that asthmatic females are more at risk of low birth weight neonates, pre-term delivery and complications such as pre-eclampsia, especially in the absence of actively managed asthma treated with inhaled corticosteroids. Pregnancy with a female foetus may particularly increase the risk of these outcomes. In addition, pregnancy has an effect on the course of asthma. The risk of an exacerbation requiring medical intervention may be as high as 50% in females with severe asthma and this may further increase the risk of poor outcomes, particularly low birth weight and pre-term delivery. The mechanisms responsible for changes in asthma with pregnancy, or alterations in pregnancy outcomes due to asthma have not been thoroughly explored. Maternal inflammatory pathways may contribute to reduced foetal growth through alterations in placental function. Asthma treatment, by reducing maternal inflammation and preventing exacerbations, is safe for use in pregnant females and contributes to improved outcomes for both mother and foetus.",,V E Murphy;P G Gibson;R Smith;V L Clifton
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16270716/,Biomarkers and childhood asthma: improving control today and tomorrow,"Although we aim to normalize the lives of children with asthma by controlling their day and night symptoms and preventing exacerbations and morbidity, optimal childhood asthma management may result when the assessment and monitoring of asthma includes measured biomarkers--meaning objective, biological measures of lung dysfunction and inflammation. Precedence for such an approach to optimizing disease control and outcomes can be appreciated in comparing asthma with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) management in children. Optimal management of these chronic conditions shares the fundamental goals to eliminate day and night symptoms and prevent exacerbations and morbidity. However, IDDM management focuses primarily on peripheral blood biomarkers of tight control (i.e., daily serum glucose levels) and predictors of long-term morbidity (i.e., hemoglobin A1C, or hemoglobin ""remodeling"" due to chronically poor control of glucose) for optimal assessment and monitoring and to best achieve these clinical objectives (Alemzadeh R, et al. Diabetes mellitus in children. In Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 17th ed. Behrman RE, Kliegman RM, and Jenson HB (Eds). Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Co., 1947-1972, 2004). The improved outcomes in IDDM have resulted primarily from the progress to a biomarker-based assessment to achieve tight, optimal control and not, presently, as a dramatic change in therapy. The progress in IDDM management provides a compelling paradigm to consider for improving childhood asthma management. Indeed, the time is good to not only consider some newly available biomarkers, but also to reconsider some biomarkers of lung dysfunction, inflammation, and atopy that could be broadly used today. This article reconsiders the use of current and emerging measures of lung dysfunction, inflammation, and atopy in assessing tight control and long-term risk.

A number of mechanisms whereby GOR may trigger asthma have been proposed, and it is believed that acid reflux may stimulate vagal receptors in the lower oesophagus causing reflex bronchoconstriction. However, GOR may be worsened by asthma causing abnormal diaphragm mechanics and by its treatment. Formal evaluation of GOR should be considered a part of asthma assessment, particularly if asthmatic symptoms are precipitated by factors known to trigger GOR such as reclining, alcohol ingestion, and the use of theophylline. Twenty-four hour ambulatory intra-oesophageal pH monitoring remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of GOR.

On the one hand, primary allergic bacterial asthma and on the other, primary allergic extrinsic asthma; it is rare to encounter other types of asthma in infancy. Our point of vieew, as previously expressed elsewhere, is that the bacterial or infective factor is the most important etiologically. For this reason, we consider of major importance not only antibiotic treatment of the causative agent, but also immunotherapy with bacterial vaccines. Eighty patients were studied, 48 boys and 32 girls, aged between 2 and 10 years at the time immunotherapy was started. All had been diagnosed as having bronchial asthma of exclusively bacterial etiology, with or without associated paranasal sinusitis. In order to provide an objective estimate and evaluation of the efficacy of immunotherapy, the parents of the patients were interviewed and asked to complete the questionnaire shown in figure 1.

Furthermore, we are realizing that asthma, COPD, and ACOS are not single diseases but rather syndromes consisting of several endotypes and phenotypes and, consequently, comprising a spectrum of diseases. The umbrella term ACOS blurs the lines between asthma and COPD and allows an approach that simplifies therapy. However, this approach contradicts the modern concept according to which we must move toward more targeted and personalized therapies to treat patients with these diseases.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20926507/,The relationship between gastroesophageal reflux and asthma: an update,"Asthma and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are both common conditions and, hence, they often coexist. However, asthmatics have been found to have a much greater prevalence of GERD symptoms than the general population. There remains debate regarding the underlying physiologic mechanism(s) of this relationship and whether treatment of GERD actually translates into improved asthma outcomes. Based on smaller trials with somewhat conflicting results regarding improved asthma control with treatment of GERD, current guidelines recommend a trial of GERD treatment for symptomatic asthmatics even without symptoms of GERD. However, recently a large multicenter trial demonstrated that the treatment of asymptomatic GERD with proton-pump inhibitors did not improve asthma control in terms of pulmonary function, rate of asthma exacerbations, asthma-related quality of life, or asthma symptom frequency. These data suggest empiric treatment of asymptomatic GERD in asthmatics is not a useful practice. This review article provides an overview of the epidemiology and pathophysiologic relationships between asthma and GERD as well as a summary of current data regarding links between treatment of GERD with asthma outcomes.",,Jennifer W McCallister;Jonathan P Parsons;John G Mastronarde
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11393325/,Role of rural school nurses in asthma management,"Environmental, socioeconomic, psychological and familial factors in rural communities predispose children to asthma. This is not only the case in the US but also in the UK, New Zealand and other Western countries. Asthma prevalence ranges from 2.2 to 15%. Because children spend at least 6 hours of their day in school, school health personnel must be attentive to, and skilled in managing the needs and issues faced by children with asthma while at school. Rural school nurses or their deputies need to advise children with asthma about avoiding aeroallergens from hay, smoke, dust, grain in silos and animal dander from cattle and sheep. In the case of children with asthma in rural areas, symptoms may be accepted as long as the child can go to school and play. Parents in rural areas may not believe in routine preventive care for asthma as part of public health practice. Rural nurses need to be aware of current asthma guidelines and apply the concepts to prevention. They need to be proactive and engage in primary, secondary and tertiary prevention. Rural school nurses can begin by using existing resources and adapting these resources for use in rural school environments. Worldwide asthma education is fundamental to asthma patient management.",,K Huss;M Winkelstein;B Calabrese;C Rand
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31690383/,Asthma and allergies in pregnancy,"Asthma is the most common respiratory disease observed in pregnancy and is estimated to occur in approximately 5-8% of pregnant women. The course of asthma during gestation may be affected by normal physiologic changes associated with the pregnancy, environmental exposures, and adherence to medical therapy. Uncontrolled asthma poses serious risks not only to the mother but also to the fetus. However, if asthma is controlled, then most women have outcomes at or near that of the general population. Appropriate management of asthma during pregnancy includes evaluation of symptoms, regular monitoring of pulmonary function, and patient education with regard to the risks and benefits of medications. Overall, the advantages of treating asthma in pregnancy markedly outweigh any potential risks of standard medical therapies. Comorbid conditions, including allergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis of pregnancy, should also be managed during pregnancy.",,Jason H Kwah;Whitney W Stevens

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16840363/,The global burden of asthma,"There has been a sharp increase in the global prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and economic burden associated with asthma over the last 40 years, particularly in children. Approximately 300 million people worldwide currently have asthma, and its prevalence increases by 50% every decade. In North America, 10% of the population have asthma. Asthma is underdiagnosed and undertreated, although the use of inhaled corticosteroids has made a positive impact on outcomes. The increasing number of hospital admissions for asthma, which are most pronounced in young children, reflect an increase in severe asthma, poor disease management, and poverty. Worldwide, approximately 180,000 deaths annually are attributable to asthma, although overall mortality rates have fallen since the 1980s. Most asthma deaths occur in those > or = 45 years old and are largely preventable, frequently being related to inadequate long-term medical care or delays in obtaining medical help during the last attack. The financial burden on patients with asthma in different Western countries ranges from $300 to $1,300 per patient per year, disproportionately affecting those with the most severe disease. There are a number of significant barriers to reducing the burden of asthma, particularly in developing countries, where many patients have limited access to care and essential medications. The Global Initiative for Asthma has outlined a six-point patient management plan to address the effective handling of the increased number of patients in primary care. The plan focuses on patient education, written treatment plans, and ongoing communication and review with patients and their providers.",,Sidney S Braman

The effectiveness of the asthma self-management programme and participants' self-management behaviour was assessed 6 yrs after the formal end of the programme. Participants were surveyed at the time of enrollment, and 1, 2, and 6 yrs after completing the programme. In each survey, participants were questioned on markers of asthma morbidity and use of medical services during the previous 12 months. Self-management behaviour was assessed using a questionnaire at 2 years and 6 yrs. Of the 69 original participants, 47 (68%) were surveyed after 6 yrs. They generally had reduced severe asthma morbidity and emergency use of health services from baseline. In particular, the proportion who had an emergency visit to a general practitioner had decreased from 41% to 18% (p=0.02). However, the percentage of nights woken due to asthma had returned to preintervention levels, and the proportion of participants taking prescribed regular inhaled steroid had decreased from 91% to 53% (p<0.001). Compared with 2 yrs after completion of the asthma programme, self-management behaviour had also deteriorated, with 29% versus 73% (p<0.001) using their peak flow meter daily when their asthma was ""getting bad"" and 41% versus 86% (p<0.001) using the ""credit card"" plan to increase the amount of inhaled steroids in the last year. Although the programme participants were still experiencing reduced morbidity from their asthma 6 yrs after the end of the self-management programme, the benefits were less than those observed at 2 yrs. These findings suggest that under-recognition and under-treatment of asthma with appropriate amounts of inhaled steroids is a major factor contributing to asthma morbidity in this indigenous rural community. To obtain enduring benefits from a self-management system of care continued reinforcement of self-management skills seems to be an essential component of any follow-up.",,W J D'Souza;T Slater;C Fox;B Fox;H Te Karu;T Gemmell;M M Ratima;N E Pearce;R B Beasley

Through a simplified Delphi method and group discussion, seven key points regarding the use of FeNO were agreed upon. We agree that the measurement of FeNO serves for the diagnosis of asthma in specialized clinics, both in children and adults, as well as to determine the level of corticosteroid treatment. In severe asthma, we recommend FeNO for endotyping, for detecting poor therapeutic adherence, undertreatment, and the risk of crisis. We suggest FeNO can be used to determine the level of corticosteroid treatment and to identify patients at risk of loss of lung function.

Although these drugs clearly improve the symptoms of the disease and the associated physiologic abnormalities, epidemiologic studies provide important information on their effectiveness in preventing asthma morbidity and mortality. We review the evidence regarding the role of inhaled corticosteroids in the prevention of asthma fatality and hospitalization. In the process, we discuss the methodologic complexities of the nonexperimental studies and the implications of the methodologic issues on the evaluation of the impact of these drugs. Eight of the cohort and ecologic studies conducted to date strongly suggest that inhaled corticosteroids, when taken regularly, decrease the number of hospitalizations for asthma by up to 80%. For asthma death, the results of 11 investigations appear less consistent, especially those of several cohort and case-control studies whose principal objective was to examine not the benefit of inhaled corticosteroids but the adverse effects of other drug classes. Much of the inconsistency in the results, however, can be explained by weaknesses in study design and analysis-in particular, the failure to consider exposure in terms of regular use of inhaled corticosteroids. When the most recent study involving the use of the Saskatchewan databases is considered, it is evident that regular treatment with conventional or low-dose inhaled cortico-steroids results in a significant reduction in fatalities due to asthma. In all, the evidence to date strongly indicates that regular use of inhaled corticosteroids, even at low doses, would prevent the major portion of asthma hospitalizations and deaths.",,S Suissa;P Ernst

With training costs of approximately 10,000 dollars/person, around 8 million dollarsis lost per year. Improved methods in diagnosing asthma would be beneficial. The aim of this study was to determine the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), a marker of airway inflammation, in a military recruit population referred for an asthma evaluation. In BMTs referred for respiratory complaints during basic training, FENO levels were determined before an asthma evaluation consisting of a history, physical, baseline spirometry, and histamine bronchoprovocation. Of 172 BMTs who had symptoms suggestive of asthma and underwent histamine bronchoprovocation, 80% were diagnosed with asthma. FENO levels were significantly higher in asthmatic patients than nonasthmatic patients (mean, 30 parts per billion [ppb] versus 19 ppb, p < 0.001; median, 21 ppb versus 17 ppb, p < 0.02). Various FENO cutoff points provided a range of sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of asthma. However, an optimal FENO cutoff level for asthma was not obtained. An FENO value of 10.5 ppb provided a sensitivity of 86% for the diagnosis of asthma, but specificity was only 21%. In contrast, an FENO value of 46 ppb provided 100% specificity but only 17% sensitivity. FENO levels were significantly elevated in BMTs diagnosed with asthma but the lack of an optimal cutoff level limits the test as a diagnostic tool for asthma.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23775350/,Will symptom-based therapy be effective for treating asthma in children?,"Traditionally, symptoms are important patient-oriented outcomes in asthma treatment, and assessment of symptoms is an essential component of assessing asthma control. However, variable airways obstruction, airways hyperresponsiveness and chronic inflammation are key components of the asthma syndrome, and correlations among these hallmarks and symptoms are weak or even absent. Therefore, it might be questioned if symptom-based therapy is effective for treating asthma in (all) children. To date, there is no firm indication that monitoring asthma based on repetitive lung function measurement or markers of airway inflammation is superior to monitoring based on symptoms only. In the majority of patients, symptom-based asthma management may well be sufficient, and in preschool children, symptoms are presently the only feasible outcome. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that selected groups might benefit from an approach that takes into account individual phenotypic characteristics.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9951318/,[The natural history of asthma],"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of airways with a multifactorial pathogenesis. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of the disease which can vary in the same patient through time. Due to its complexity, natural history of asthma is poorly well-known. Generally, in the history of asthma three periods of life are taken into consideration: early childhood, adolescence and adult life. It has been demonstrated that less than one third of children who are affected by wheezing in early childhood develop a true asthma afterwards. Usually in these subjects who are male and atopic, viruses and subsequently allergens represent the most important factors responsible for the development of asthma. During adolescence airborne allergens represent the main cause of the disease: mites in infancy and pollens in late childhood. The incidence of asthma during adolescence is growing according to recent studies, and even if the symptomatology of asthma improves through time, about two thirds of patients remain asthmatic in their adult life. As regards adults etiology, it is less known, women are more frequently affected than men and the prognosis is generally poorer. Several factors negatively influence the course of asthma such as age, smoking, the severity of the disease during infancy, the persistence of functional obstructive alterations and the increased aspecific bronchial reactivity. Adequate therapy is crucially important to cope with these factors and can change the course of the disease.",,F Gani;M Landi;V Ricca;G Senna;P Mezzelani

Characteristics of airway responses in each clinical asthma type were compared between 25 elderly (mean age, 65.2 years) and 30 younger subjects (mean age, 44.9 years) with bronchial asthma, by observing ventilatory function and cellular composition in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. 1. In patients with types 1a-2 and Ib, the %V25 value was significantly lower in the elderly subjects than in the younger subjects. 2. Comparing the values of ventilatory parameters of type Ia-1 cases with other asthma types, %V25 value was lower in other asthma types than in type Ia-1 in the elderly. All ventilatory parameters examined were generally lower in type II cases than in other asthma types in the elderly, but this difference was not significant.

It begins early in life in many subjects with intermittent symptoms occurring with viral respiratory tract infections. Over time, and in genetically susceptible children (those with an atopic predisposition), the disease becomes more persistent with symptoms occurring in the absence of respiratory tract infections. Children with persistent wheezing are eventually diagnosed with asthma, with those at greatest risk having developed allergic sensitization early in life. Among children with asthma, some will have lifelong asthma with active symptoms and progressive loss of lung function over time, whereas other children will undergo asthma remission in adolescence. Once in remission, the disease may remain quiescent, or it may relapse in midadult life.

The relevance of epigenetic mechanisms in regulating asthma-related gene expression was strengthened. Predicting and preventing exacerbations throughout life might help to reduce progressive lung function decrease and disease severity in adulthood. Although allergy has long been linked to asthma exacerbations, a mechanism through which IgE impairs rhinovirus immunity and underlies asthma exacerbations was demonstrated and improved by anti-IgE therapy (omalizumab).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32893125/,Japanese guidelines for adult asthma 2020,"Bronchial asthma is characterized by chronic airway inflammation, which manifests clinically as variable airway narrowing (wheezes and dyspnea) and cough. Long-standing asthma may induce airway remodeling and become intractable. The prevalence of asthma has increased; however, the number of patients who die from it has decreased (1.3 per 100,000 patients in 2018). The goal of asthma treatment is to control symptoms and prevent future risks. A good partnership between physicians and patients is indispensable for effective treatment. Long-term management with therapeutic agents and the elimination of the triggers and risk factors of asthma are fundamental to its treatment. Asthma is managed by four steps of pharmacotherapy, ranging from mild to intensive treatments, depending on the severity of disease; each step includes an appropriate daily dose of an inhaled corticosteroid, which may vary from low to high. Long-acting β2-agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, sustained-release theophylline, and long-acting muscarinic antagonists are recommended as add-on drugs, while anti-immunoglobulin E antibodies and other biologics, and oral steroids are reserved for very severe and persistent asthma related to allergic reactions. Bronchial thermoplasty has recently been developed for severe, persistent asthma, but its long-term efficacy is not known. Inhaled β2-agonists, aminophylline, corticosteroids, adrenaline, oxygen therapy, and other approaches are used as needed during acute exacerbations, by selecting treatment steps for asthma based on the severity of the exacerbations.

These cells release a wide variety of inflammatory mediators that activate several target cells in the airway, resulting in bronchoconstriction, microvascular leakage and oedema, mucus hypersecretion and stimulation of neural reflexes. Recent evidence suggests that mast cells do not have a key role in either the late response or in bronchial hyper-responsiveness, though they may be involved in immediate responses to allergens. The possible role of other inflammatory cells and the many different mediators which have been implicated in asthma are discussed.

By conservative estimates, severe asthma affects approximately 5-10% of patients with asthma worldwide. Severe asthma impairs patients' health-related quality of life, and patients are at risk of life-threatening asthma attacks. Severe asthma also accounts for the majority of health care expenditures associated with asthma. Guidelines recommend that patients with severe asthma be referred to a specialist respiratory team for correct diagnosis and expert management. This is particularly important to ensure that they have access to newly available biologic treatments. However, many patients with severe asthma can suffer multiple asthma attacks and wait several years before they are referred for specialist care. As global patient advocates, we believe it is essential to raise awareness and understanding for patients, caregivers, health care professionals, and the public about the substantial impact of severe asthma and to create opportunities for improving patient care. Patients should be empowered to live a life free of symptoms and the adverse effects of traditional medications (e.g., oral corticosteroids), reducing hospital visits and emergency care, the loss of school and work days, and the constraints placed on their daily lives.

How do we interpret inflammatory changes in the light of age-related airway inflammation? Is there an interaction between perception of airway narrowing and severity or control of disease? Are symptom-based action plans appropriate? Is control of the disease affected by the distribution of inhaled therapeutic aerosols and dry powder particles? WHAT WE NEED TO DO: Include patients aged 80 years and over in clinical trials. Assess functional and inflammatory parameters with appropriate age-matched controls in clinical trials. Assess feasibility and efficacy of symptom-based action plans versus those based on objective monitoring.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11812274/,Practical management of acute asthma in adults,"All asthma patients are at risk for acute asthma exacerbations. Moderate to severe exacerbations account for many emergency department visits and subsequent hospitalizations each year. Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of acute asthma. The purpose of this review is to provide practical guidance in the assessment and treatment of adults with acute asthma in the hospital setting. Managing patients with acute asthma involves assessing the severity of the exacerbation, implementing measures to rapidly reverse airflow limitation, and instituting therapies that limit the progression of airway inflammation. Some patients may benefit from other supportive measures such as heliox and noninvasive ventilation. If the patient continues to deteriorate and requires mechanical ventilation, then ventilator settings that minimize the risk of hyperinflation should be chosen. After an episode of acute asthma, long-term preventive medications, especially inhaled corticosteroids, should be prescribed and education should be provided to prevent future episodes.",,Teal S Hallstrand;John V Fahy
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2649762/,Asthma in pregnancy,"The main pregnancy-induced changes in respiratory physiology are increased minute-ventilation, due primarily to an increase in tidal volume; a 20 per cent decrease in the functional residual volume; and a decrease in the arterial pCO2 resulting from increased alveolar ventilation. The management of acute asthma is changed very little by pregnancy. Beta-adrenergic agonists, theophylline, and glucocorticoids are all as safe as they are in the nonpregnant state; they are not teratogenic. Iodides are contraindicated in pregnancy. Ephedrine and combination products containing theophylline are best avoided during pregnancy, not because they are dangerous but because better preparations are available.",,R W Huff
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31290808/,Understanding the genetics of asthma and implications for clinical practice,"Asthma is one of the most common heritable diseases globally, with variable clinical expression and response to treatment that is attributed to underlying genetic differences. Hundreds of loci on multiple chromosomes are associated with asthma. Although routine genetic screening is not recommended, testing for medication responsiveness might soon play a role in clinical management. Pharmacogenetic research remains early stage but has demonstrated potential for both clinical and cost effectiveness. Furthermore, recognition of clinically apparent asthma phenotypes, the result of genetic and environmental interactions, can help to inform treatment decisions. Phenotypes are divided into two broad categories of atopic and nonatopic disease, with further subdivisions that are associated with clinical presentation patterns and responsiveness to treatment. In general, earlier onset and allergic disease will respond well to traditional therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and leukotrienes because these medications target inflammatory pathways for allergic disease. However, patients with late-onset, symptom predominant (lacking inflammation), and obese asthma might be resistant to standard therapy and may require treatment modification. These patients are at risk for overuse of ICSs with poor response and may benefit more by use of long-acting beta agonists, long-acting muscarinic agonists, weight reduction, and exercise.",,Jennifer R Mammen;Kimberly Arcoleo
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19210908/,Irreversible airway obstruction in asthma,"Asthma is generally characterized by fully reversible airway obstruction. However, a significant proportion of asthma patients demonstrate an incomplete reversibility of airway obstruction (IRAO) despite optimal treatment and the absence of a significant smoking history. Such partially irreversible airway obstruction may be due to residual airway inflammation, particularly of the eosinophilic type, and structural changes. Risks factors for IRAO include reduced pulmonary function early in life, frequent exacerbations, smoking, continuing exposure to a sensitizing agent, and adult-onset asthma. IRAO is associated with increased disease severity and increased asthma-related morbidity and mortality. Optimal asthma control, including prevention of asthma exacerbations, smoking avoidance, and sufficient anti-inflammatory therapy, should be implemented in an effort to avoid an accelerated decline in lung function and the development or worsening of IRAO.",,Louis-Philippe Boulet

To date, there is no universally accepted definition of this overlap syndrome, just as there is no blood test or other technologic assessment that provides a simple way to distinguish asthma from COPD. One practical approach to the overlap diagnosis has been to include patients with a diagnosis of COPD by Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria and asthma defined by subject report of a physician diagnosis of asthma before the age of 40 years. Alternatively, it includes patients who meet criteria for COPD (fixed airflow obstruction) and who also have typical features of asthma (wheezing, atopy, eosinophilia, and positive bronchodilator response on spirometry). Compared with patients with COPD alone, the overlap patients are younger with less smoking intensity, have higher health-care utilization, have a worse disease-related quality of life, and have a higher mortality.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30915875/,Linking endotypes to omics profiles in difficult-to-control asthma using the diagnostic Chinese medicine syndrome differentiation algorithm,"Objective: Patients with difficult-to-control asthma have difficulty breathing almost all of the time, even leading to life-threatening asthma attacks. However, only few diagnostic markers for this disease have been identified. We aimed to take advantage of unique Chinese medicine theories for phenotypic classification and to explore molecular signatures in difficult-to-control asthma. Methods: The Chinese medicine syndrome differentiation algorithm (CMSDA) is a syndrome-scoring classification method based on the Chinese medicine overall observation theory. Patients with difficult-to-control asthma were classified into Cold- and Hot-pattern groups according to the CMSDA. DNA methylation and metabolomic profiles were obtained using Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip and gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. Subsequently, an integrated bioinformatics analysis was performed to compare those two patterns and identify Cold/Hot-associated candidates, followed by functional validation studies. Results: A total of 20 patients with difficult-to-control asthma were enrolled in the study. Ten were grouped as Cold and 10 as Hot according to the CMSDA. We identified distinct whole-genome DNA methylation and metabolomic profiles between Cold- and Hot-pattern groups. ALDH3A1 gene exhibited variations in the DNA methylation probe cg10791966, while two metabolic pathways were associated with those two patterns. Conclusions: Our study introduced a novel diagnostic classification approach, the CMSDA, for difficult-to-control asthma. This is an alternative way to categorize diverse syndromes and link endotypes with omics profiles of this disease.

The Hygiene Hypothesis was born from work made by Dr. David Strachan, who observed that younger siblings were less susceptible to eczema and asthma, and proposed that this was a result of increased transmission of infectious agents via unhygienic practices within a household. This initial hypothesis was then reframed as the old friends/microbiota hypothesis, implicating non-pathogenic commensal microorganisms as the source of immunomodulatory signals necessary to prevent immune-mediated chronic disorders. Although the hygiene hypothesis is supported by epidemiological research of allergic diseases in certain industrialized settings, it often fails to explain the incidence of asthma in less affluent regions of the world.

Many of its features are identical with those of allergic asthma by sensitization to air-borne allergens. Exposure to isocyanate before the first symptoms of asthma varies from a few weeks to several years. The prevalence of isocyanate-induced asthma has been estimated at 5 to 25%. Atopy is found in less than 30% of the cases. A significant increase of HRBNS can be demonstrated in most patients, but it may be absent. It may also fluctuate with the working periods or after a bronchial provocation test with isocyanate. Elimination of this compound reduces the HRBNS level in only one quarter of the cases. Delayed or biphasic reactions are frequent: 30 to 60% depending of the authors. An early diagnosis followed by total elimination may result in complete cure, but more than 50% of the patients remain symptomatic and with HRBNS. An IgE-dependent mechanism can be demonstrated in about 20% of the cases.

The intensity of an exacerbation may vary form a mild, transient worsening marked by a cough and moderate shortness of breath to a very severe and life-threatening condition. The clinical features of asthma include increased rate of breathing, cough, and prolonged and difficult expiration. The expiratory flow limitation could be quantified, objectified, and monitored by the lung function measurements (PEF or FEV1 ). It is of crucial importance to recognize properly the early signs of an exacerbation, judge its severity, and promptly start the treatments. The strategy of the treatment of an asthma exacerbation includes the repeated administration of rapid-acting inhaled bronchodilators, the early introduction of systemic glucocorticoids and oxygen supplementation.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12221892/,The role of small airway inflammation in asthma,"Although inflammation in the large central airways has been the subject of numerous asthma studies, inflammation in the small distal airways remained largely unexamined because of the relative inaccessibility of these structures. However, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, combining endobronchial and transbronchial biopsy, now allows specimens to be obtained from both proximal and distal areas of the lung. Newly refined morphometric and immunocytochemical techniques have been applied to both autopsy and lung biopsy specimens. Together, these technological changes have had a profound impact on the study of small airway inflammation. Now, it is understood that the asthma-associated inflammation evident in the large airways occurs in the distal airways as well. The inflammatory process in the two regions has related features: infiltrates contain activated T lymphocytes and eosinophils, increased mucus plugging, and smooth muscle hyperplasia can be observed. Although the similarities are pronounced, inflammation in the small airways differs in important ways from large airway inflammation. The eosinophilic infiltration that occurs throughout the asthmatic lung also is active in the small airways. The contribution of small airway inflammation to deficits in pulmonary function has been clarified by thoracic high-resolution computed tomography imaging. Results of such imaging suggest that the distal airways are a major site of airway obstruction in patients with asthma and may play a significant role in airway hyperresponsiveness; both disorders are cardinal features of asthma. In addition, functional bronchoscopic studies of the small airways in asthma patients have found high peripheral airflow resistance, even when lung function appears normal. Current formulations of inhaled anti-inflammatory medications, particularly corticosteroids administered by metered dose inhalers using chlorofluorocarbon propellants, treat the proximal airways more effectively than the distal airways. However, some new formulations of inhaled steroids that utilize hydrofluoroalkane propellants produce aerosols of smaller average particle size, with greater penetration into the peripheral airways. Their potential to treat inflammation at peripheral sites may account for the significant improvements in asthma outcomes that have been reported in clinical trials of these new formulations.",,Donald P Tashkin

Although tobacco smoke exposure is related to an increase in the prevalence of asthma, there is lack of information on that respect in children from developing countries, where active tobacco smoking usually starts early in adolescence. This study was undertaken to assess the effect of tobacco smoking on the prevalence of asthma symptoms in a random sample of 4738 adolescents aged 13.4 +/- 1.05 years who responded the ISAAC video questionnaires plus questions on tobacco smoking. The prevalence of tobacco smoking in the last 12 months was 16.2%, with significant female predominance. The persistent smokers had a significantly higher prevalence of asthma-like symptoms ever and in the last 12 months (wheezing, wheezing with exercise, nocturnal wheezing, severe wheezing, and dry nocturnal cough) than ex-smokers and nonsmokers.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8298766/,Clinical and symptom measures,"We present a review of specific health status measures, including symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory tests (exclusive of lung function tests), in terms of their suitability for assessing the presence and severity of asthma in epidemiologic and clinical research. We focus on the validity, reliability, and responsiveness to clinical intervention of these measures. Several adult questionnaires designed for epidemiologic research include questions on asthma and wheezing that have demonstrated repeatability and validity against concurrent measurements of nonspecific airway responsiveness. The International Union Against Tuberculosis Bronchial Symptoms Questionnaire was designed specifically to detect asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness in adult populations, and its reliability and validity have been well documented. A childhood questionnaire developed by Australian investigators has been demonstrated to provide information on asthma and wheezing that is reliable and valid against the criterion of concurrently measured nonspecific airway responsiveness. Although suitable for epidemiologic research, these questionnaires do not provide sufficient data on the severity of current asthma symptoms (aspects of which include intensity, duration, and frequency of symptoms) to be useful for clinical research involving subjects with established asthma. Many different methods of obtaining and analyzing symptom data have been used in clinical trials, but these have not received the methodologic scrutiny that allow the recommendation of a ""best"" approach for evaluating symptoms in clinical trials of interventions for asthma. The use of daily symptom diaries in short-term drug trials is common, but the optimal symptom-reporting interval for such studies has not been established. Similarly, a particular approach to integrating different symptoms (wheeze, dyspnea, cough, sputum) and the different aspects of these symptoms (intensity, duration, frequency) cannot be recommended on the basis of available data. Physical examination findings have little utility as asthma outcome measures because they may be normal between symptom episodes, they have relatively poor interobserver reliability, and they are relatively poor predictors of the outcome of emergency room visits for asthma. The finding of an elevated arterial PCO2 has utility as an indicator of a severe asthma attack, but arterial blood gas measurements have little other utility as asthma outcome measures. The chest radiograph is generally normal in patients with asthma and therefore not useful as an asthma outcome measure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,G T O'Connor;S T Weiss
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10669525/,Prevalence and etiology of asthma,"An increased understanding of the causes of asthma is coming from the international comparisons of asthma prevalence, particularly those from the European Community Respiratory Health Survey of asthma prevalence in adults and the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood. From these and other studies of asthma prevalence, it is possible to draw some tentative conclusions as to the patterns of asthma prevalence worldwide. There are five striking patterns: first, asthma prevalence is increasing worldwide; second, asthma is generally more common in Western countries and less common in developing countries; third, asthma is more prevalent in English-speaking countries; fourth, asthma prevalence is increasing in developing countries as they become more Westernized or communities become urbanized; and fifth, the prevalence of other allergic disorders may also be increasing worldwide. These five key features of the international patterns of asthma prevalence raise major questions about the role of ""established"" risk factors for the development of asthma. As a result, recent research has expanded to include the study of novel factors that may ""program"" the initial susceptibility to sensitization or contribute to the development of asthma independent of atopic sensitization. These include various exposures in utero, which are reflected in various perinatal factors measured at birth, and exposures (or lack of exposures) in the early years of life that may make the infant more susceptible to the subsequent development of asthma.

Furthermore, patient's overestimation or underestimation of the severity of the disease and differences in the opinions on the level of asthma control required between patients and physicians and also between physicians in both primary care and specialist settings are common and may negatively affect asthma control and future risks.

A pragmatic approach that sets therapeutic goals for each individual and associates them with the treatable traits of asthma which, when therapeutically targeted, will in many cases help to achieve the goals, seems more reasonable than the present stepping approach.",Asthma; asthma yardstick; guidelines; mart approach; step-down; step-up.,Mario Cazzola;Maria Gabriella Matera;Paola Rogliani;Luigino Calzetta;Josuel Ora
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21477457/,Exhaled nitric oxide as a tool in managing and monitoring difficult-to-treat asthma,"Most patients diagnosed with asthma maintain control reasonably well and do not experience asthma exacerbations; however, on average, 30% of patients achieve suboptimal control, have severe or difficult-to-treat asthma, and are relatively nonresponsive to the same medications that achieve and maintain asthma control for most patients. This small patient population of difficult-to-treat or severe asthma accounts for 80% of asthma medical costs. This study was designed to determine the potential U.S. payer cost savings resulting from an asthma specialist incorporating fractionated exhaled nitric oxide (FE(NO)) as an asthma management or monitoring tool to guide treatment of difficult-to-treat asthma patients. We present an annual medical resource use scenario typical of a difficult-to-treat asthma patient as well as five hypothetical scenarios of annual medical resource use for a difficult-to-treat asthma patient being managed with regular FE(NO) measurements in addition to current standard asthma management guidelines. We used the most conservative estimate of the potential asthma cost savings when FE(NO) measurement is used for difficult-to-treat asthma. The most likely clinical scenario assumes a 5% reduction in hospitalization and emergency department costs only. The inclusion of FE(NO) measurements to the asthma management strategy would essentially reach parity with the current standard of care, despite the additional cost of FE(NO) MEASUREMENTS: Additional scenarios were examined, all showed cost and use reduction across all medical resource usage categories. Use of exhaled NO measurement to guide asthma management, maintenance, and control in difficult-to-treat asthma would almost certainly result in cost savings to the payer.",,Don Bukstein;Allan T Luskin;Elizabeth A Brooks

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3055097/,[Occupational asthma: methods of diagnosis and principle etiologies],"The diagnosis of occupational asthma requires the integration of a multiplicity of data; the history, cutaneous skin tests, respiratory function tests and non-specific tests of bronchial hyper-reactivity and specific bronchial provocation tests. The history remains fundamental in the investigation of occupational asthma. It should particularly search for the presence of an atopic trait, the occurrence of similar disorders in members of the same firm and also the timing of symptoms in relation to the occupational activities. Cutaneous tests are particularly helpful in IgE-mediated asthma in relation to the inhalation of animal or vegetable materials of glycoprotein origin. For haptens, the need for their prior coupling to a protein carrier causes problems which have not been entirely resolved. Laboratory tests (RAST, histamine liberation, TDBH...) run into the same snags. Respiratory function and non specific bronchial provocation tests confirm the diagnosis of asthma and enable the medium and long term progress to be assessed. Specific bronchial provocation tests are the most appropriate tests to establish an aetiological diagnosis in occupational asthma. Different technical methods are possible: quantitative administration of allergen, aerosols, and realistic tests using exposure chambers to achieve true test doses and to obtain dose dependent responses. The products responsible for occupational asthma are multiple and are gathered into two tables. The different substances are characterised in a simplified manner. First animal matter (mammalian and arthropod allergens), secondly substances of vegetable origin (roots, leaves, flowers, grain and flour, wood and its derivatives) and finally chemical products. The chemical products are primarily from the pharmaceutical and metal industries and above all from the plastics industry.",,G Pauli;J C Bessot

A Forward-Looking Synthesis and Commentary,"Asthma is an aberrant inflammatory condition of the airways affecting approximately 1 in 10 children in affluent countries. An increasing body of evidence suggests that microbial exposures during a ""critical window"" of development in early life play a central role in determining future asthma susceptibility. However, like the disease itself, considerable heterogeneity exists among studies in which researchers have investigated the associations between particular microbial taxa and asthma immunology. As our understanding of asthmatic pathology evolves to enable clearer definition of asthma endotypes, it will be important to consider the impact of various environmental factors on each endotype. Given the strong evidence in support of the hypothesis that early-life microbial exposures predict later disease states such as asthma, consideration of these endotypes when establishing experimental outcomes in epidemiological studies could allow for increased precision when determining exposure-outcome associations and engaging in more focused follow-up mechanistic investigations.",asthma; endotypes; immune regulation; microbiota; perinatal window.,Rozlyn C T Boutin;Charisse Petersen;B Brett Finlay

Diagnostic and therapeutic problems contribute to older patients being inadequately treated. The diagnosis of asthma rests on the history and characteristic pulmonary function testing (PFT) with the demonstration of reversible airway obstruction, but there are unique problems in performing this test in older patients and in its interpretation. This review aims to address the difficulties in performing and interpreting PFT in older patients because of the effects of age-related changes in lung function on respiratory physiology. The concept of ""airway remodeling"" resulting in ""fixed obstructive"" PFT and the relevance of atopy in older people with asthma are assessed. There are certain therapeutic issues unique to older patients with asthma, including the increased probability of adverse effects in the setting of multiple comorbidities and issues surrounding effective drug delivery. The use of beta 2-agonist, anticholinergic, corticosteroid, and anti-immunoglobulin E treatments are discussed in the context of these therapeutic issues.",,Sanjay Haresh Chotirmall;Michael Watts;Peter Branagan;Ciaran F Donegan;Allan Moore;Noel Gerard McElvaney

A case-crossover study design was used. Hospital emergency department visits for asthma between 1992 and 2000 were identified based on patients' presenting complaints. We obtained hourly measures for the following meteorological variables: wind speed, temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, and visibility. Particular emphasis was placed on exploring the association between asthma visits and fog, thunderstorms, snow, and liquid and freezing forms of precipitation. In total, there were 18,970 asthma visits among children between 2 and 15 years of age. The number of visits and weather characteristics were grouped into 6 h case and control intervals. The occurrence of fog or liquid precipitation was associated with an increased number of asthma visits, while snow was associated with a reduced number (P<0.05). Stratified analyses by season found no association in any of the four calendar intervals between the number of asthma visits and visibility, change in relative humidity and change in temperature. In contrast, summertime thunderstorm activity was associated with an odds ratio of 1.35 (95% CI=1.02-1.77) relative to summer periods with no activity.

Whilst medical parameters have been thoroughly studied, few data are available concerning psychological intervention. The aim of our open pilot study was to verify whether any difference in perceived illness and response style to asthma existed in the patients enrolled in an Asthma Rehabilitation Group (ARG) and in a Control Group (CG). Forty consecutive asthmatics were randomly enrolled, all of whom were diagnosed, treated and followed-up according to the International Guidelines. Both groups underwent a psychological assessment at baseline and after one year. A battery of questionnaires was used to obtain data relating to baseline characteristics (anxiety, depression, psychophysiological disorders), emotional reactions to asthma attacks (panic-fear, etc,) and cognitive variables (external control, psychological stigma, internal beliefs, external chance, etc.) involved in the perceived illness. In addition, the Asthma Rehabilitation Group patients underwent an educational programme and a cognitive-behavioural intervention. In both groups, a reduction of anxiety and depression scores was observed, as well as a significant improvement of the medical parameters evaluated. Only the Asthma Rehabilitation Group reported lower scores on the Psychophysiological Questionnaire and on the External Control Subscale after 1 year. The Control Group reported higher score on the External Chance Scale. The data of our study seem to confirm the effectiveness of psychological intervention on the cognitive skills involved in the perception and management of asthma.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25760347/,Adiponectin in asthma: implications for phenotyping,"Asthma is a heterogeneous inflammatory airway disease, which exhibits multiple phenotypes, mainly defined by a combination of different clinical features. Asthma phenotypes include age at onset, smoking status, exacerbations frequency, and co-existence of obesity. Links between specific biological pathways and phenotypes are emerging. The genetic background together with detectable biomarkers could more accurately identify asthma phenotypes consistent with clinical-physiological characteristics and response to therapies. Several cross-sectional studies indicate a strict correlation between adipose tissue, obesity, and asthma suggesting that obesity is not only a risk factor for asthma but also a predictor of poor prognosis. Despite the strong clinical correlation between obesity and asthma, the underlying biological pathways have not been extensively investigated. Recently, a pivotal role for adiponectin has been recognized in physio-pathological conditions of lung. Adiponectin is expressed as a 247 residues long protein and secreted as oligomers of low, medium and high molecular weight. The larger oligomers seem to have a more pronounced insulinsensitizing, anti-atherogenic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Interestingly, the three receptors AdipoR1, AdipoR2, and Tcadherin mediating adiponectin activity are expressed on lung cells mediating adiponectin beneficial effects. Recently, different studies demonstrated the involvement of adiponectin in asthma since its levels and the expression of AdipoR1, AdipoR2 and T-cadherin are modulated in asthma patients and in asthma mouse models. In the present study, we review the literature reporting adiponectin impact on expression of specific clinical asthma phenotypes.",,Ersilia Nigro;Aurora Daniele;Olga Scudiero;Maria Ludovica Monaco;Fiorentina Roviezzo;Bruno D'Agostino;Gennaro Mazzarella;Andrea Bianco
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9316096/,The burden of pediatric asthma,"Childhood asthma is common and its prevalence is increasing in most countries of the world. Large-scale studies indicate that approximately one-third of children with asthma have had five or more episodes of wheezing in the previous 12 months. Such frequency of symptoms leads to a significant number of days lost from school, interference with physical exercise, and underfunctioning at school because of interrupted sleep. In cases of more severe asthma, the more frequent school absences may affect the individual's education and, possibly, choice of career. In addition to the extensive individual burden of asthma, the burden on the family is substantial. Additional housework may be required to reduce the child's exposure to potential environmental triggers. Time ""off work"" may be required to take care of a sick child. In cases of severe asthma, children regularly wake at night, and 50% of parents indicate limitation of their social life. Sibling studies show that sometimes siblings who do not have asthma are neglected and that parents may have insufficient time to devote to them. Mortality in pediatric asthma is low, but there has been little reduction in recent years. When viewed as potential life-years lost, the burden is considerable in social and economic terms. In the United States, the mean annual cost per patient has been estimated at in excess of US$1,000. In Australia, the cost ranges from A$85 to A$884 per patient, depending on asthma severity. In the United Kingdom the estimated annual costs of childhood asthma to the Health Service are between Pounds 100 million and Pounds 150 million. To reduce the burden to patients, their families, and health care services, improved understanding of the basic pathophysiology of asthma is necessary.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20940681/,Current management of allergic asthma in children,"Asthma in children is characterized by recurring symptoms such as wheezing, breathlessness, and cough, by airflow obstruction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and by underlying inflammation. The presence of allergic sensitization, and allergic rhinitis in particular, is strongly associated with asthma. The goal of management of asthma is to achieve and maintain control of the clinical manifestations of the disease. This can be obtained by drug treatment, education of patients and care givers, and, in allergic asthma, by allergen avoidance and specific immunotherapy. The drugs used in asthma can be classified as controllers - such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and leukotriene receptor antagonists - or relievers (bronchodilators to be used during acute exacerbations of asthma). ICS are the most effective anti-inflammatory controllers for the management of persistent asthma in children of all ages, but there is no consensus about the optimal starting dose. Dose-response studies reported marked and rapid improvement in clinical symptoms and lung function at low doses of ICS, and mild asthma is well controlled by such doses in most children, this ensuring good safety. If there is no improvement with the initial low dose of ICS, an increased ICS dose or additional therapy with leukotriene receptor antagonists or long-acting inhaled β2-agonists should be considered. When asthma is caused by allergy to aeroallergens, specific immunotherapy must be taken into account, in its two forms of subcutaneous or sublingual immunotherapy. The former has complete evidence of efficacy, but the sublingual route is safer and more easily accepted by children.",,G Leo;C Incorvaia

However, it is difficult to detect and frequently overlooked leading to inappropriate escalation of asthma treatment. There is a need for cost effective ways to monitor adherence in order to intervene to change this modifiable behavior. Areas covered: Several measurement tools have been developed to assess adherence in adults and children with asthma. The current methods for measuring adherence, both subjective and objective, have several flaws and even the current gold standard, electronic monitoring devices (EMDs), has limitations. This review will outline and critique the adherence monitoring tools and highlight ways in which they have been used for the purpose of intervention. Expert commentary: Although advances have been made in adherence monitoring, we still have some way to go in creating the ideal monitoring tool. There are no validated tailored self-monitoring questionnaires for children with asthma and most objective measures, such as prescription refill rate and weighing canisters, overestimate adherence. Current EMDs, although useful, need improved accuracy to ensure that both actuation and inhalation are measured, and the devices need to be affordable for use in routine health-care practice.",Asthma; adherence; children; compliance; electronic monitoring devices; intervention; monitoring; pediatric; self-report.,Christina Joanne Pearce;Louise Fleming

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16541963/,Epidemiology and pathophysiology of immunoglobulin E-mediated asthma,"Asthma is one of the most common chronic conditions affecting mankind. The development of asthma may at least in part result from genetic or host susceptibility to asthma, allergy or atopy, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The interaction between the at risk host and environmental exposures to allergens, air pollutants, and viral infections may lead to the development of asthma. Much is mentioned about the hygiene hypothesis as a possible reason for the increased in atopy conditions such as asthma in developed countries throughout the world. With the discovery of immunoglobulin E (IgE), the medical community has learned the importance of this immunoglobulin in all atopic conditions, especially asthma. Recent literature in peer-reviewed journals on serum IgE and asthma was examined. Numerous studies clearly show the relationship of asthma to specific allergens, but only recently has there been documentation of the association of total serum IgE level with airways hyperreactivity and asthma. Data on patients with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma showed serum IgE levels higher in asthmatic patients than in nonasthmatic patients and the more severe the asthma, the higher the serum IgE. Our increasing knowledge of the underlying role of IgE in the asthmatic patient should pave the way for better treatments for this population of sufferers.",,Michael S Blaiss

Fifteen children received biofeedback training to reduce facial tension, and 14 children, who served as controls, received biofeedback training to maintain facial tension at a stable level. Assignment to experimental condition was random. As a result of training, electromyographic levels decreased in children trained in facial relaxation and remained fairly constant in children trained in facial tension stability. Biofeedback training was augmented for children in both groups by having them practice their facial exercises at home. Each child's condition was followed for a five-month period subsequent to biofeedback training. Throughout the experiment, the following measures of asthma severity were monitored: lung function, self-rated asthma severity, medication usage, and frequency of asthma attacks. In addition, standardized measures of attitudes toward asthma, self-concept, and chronic anxiety were recorded at regular intervals. As compared to the facial stability subjects, the facial relaxation subjects exhibited higher pulmonary scores, more positive attitudes toward asthma, and lower chronic anxiety during the follow-up period. Subjects in the two groups, however, did not differ on self-rated asthma severity, medication usage, frequency of asthma attacks, or self-concept.

They are also highly effective for the management of exercise-induced asthma and nocturnal symptoms of the disease. Mounting evidence suggests that these agents may have the potential for the development of tolerance, particularly to their bronchodilating effects, and this tolerance may be associated with increases in asthma-related morbidity and mortality, though this link remains controversial. However, experience to date indicates that the beta-agonists do not share the same propensity to cause tolerance. Instead, tolerance appears to be more closely associated with the regular use of these drugs rather than their PRN use. Furthermore, clinically relevant tolerance is more likely in patients who are treated regularly with high doses of a bronchodilator for long periods. Current therapeutic recommendations suggest that inhaled beta-agonists should be used on a PRN basis when possible and that the lowest effective doses should be administered.",,T Giangrasso

However, they have failed in the overall improvement in the management of asthma, the final objective that they are meant to achieve. Today, almost 20 years after they appeared, the majority of asthmatic patients are still inadequately controlled, partly due to lack of follow up by doctors and the rest of health care staff who have to look after them. This lack of follow up of these recommendations is probably associated with a lack of well structured planning in their circulation and implementation. Also, although the recommendations of these guidelines agree in what is essential, they differ in other aspects, which in turn could be determining factors in clinical practice.

Studies of the causes of this phenomenon involve various fields, with much attention focused on finding new antigens in food, air, articles encountered in daily living, etc. Recent studies of psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) also suggest a strong influence of emotions on allergic reactions. The number of allergic patients is increasing in all civilized countries without exception, and the stress prevalent in modern civilized society is related to this increase. Modern allergology does not yet have sufficient countermeasures for such stress states. We applied a biopsychosocial approach (BPSA) to treatment programs for allergic disease, incorporating treatment of physical and psychosocial problems en bloc. We studied the long-term effects of BPSA therapy on 82 patients who were treated for more than 3 months in the hospital and were examined 2 to 3 years after discharge. Results showed that more than 80% of patients maintained improvement and 45% of those with intractable asthma were able to withdraw from steroid hormones. BPSA achieved better results than those with standard medication administered only to the body. Improvements after treatment included physical changes, normalization of MV (microvibration) type, decreased levels of plasma histamine, and normal circadian rhythms of lymphocyte subsets. These changes reflect part of the physical mechanisms by which BPSA improves asthma symptoms. From a psychological view point, the patients' feelings, personal relations, behavior, etc. were changed after BPSA, allowing a new life style and improved QOL. It is important for asthma patients to maintain good overall condition over long periods. After BPSA, 80% of our patients were able to do so. It is difficult for the therapist to approach asthma from different aspects at once, including biological, psychological, and social, so we developed a five-stage program of BPSA therapy and found that this obtained favorable results.",,H Teshima;M Irie;H Sogawa;T Nakagawa;Y Ago
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19132973/,Dysregulation of the stress response in asthmatic children,"The stress system co-ordinates the adaptive responses of the organism to stressors of any kind. Inappropriate responsiveness may account for increased susceptibility to a variety of disorders, including asthma. Accumulated evidence from animal models suggests that exogenously applied stress enhances airway reactivity and increases allergen-induced airway inflammation. This is in agreement with the clinical observation that stressful life events increase the risk of a new asthma attack. Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by specific cytokines increases the release of cortisol, which in turn feeds back and suppresses the immune reaction. Data from animal models suggest that inability to increase glucocorticoid production in response to stress is associated with increased airway inflammation with mechanical dysfunction of the lungs. Recently, a growing body of evidence shows that asthmatic subjects who are not treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are likely to have an attenuated activity and/or responsiveness of their HPA axis. In line with this concept, most asthmatic children demonstrate improved HPA axis responsiveness on conventional doses of ICS, as their airway inflammation subsides. Few patients may experience further deterioration of adrenal function, a phenomenon which may be genetically determined.",,K N Priftis;A Papadimitriou;P Nicolaidou;G P Chrousos

The necessity to develop effective treatments against it requires an organized effort which covers every aspect of the disease from the pathological alterations via the genetic background to the use and development of active remedies. In these processes animal experiments have served an indispensable role. As asthma is not a natural disease in the animal kingdom the variety for artificially established animal models is quite wide. The possible selection ranges from the laboratory mouse to the horse, it includes ferret and sheep and even favorite pets such as cats and dogs. The large number of the models indicates that to some extent they might not be appropriate or it means that there is no generally accepted model of human asthma. Whatever the reason for this diversity animal models helped us to understand the detailed pathogenesis of some aspects of the disease, they helped us to develop compounds which are more active then previously used ones, and these models proved to us that human asthma is a unique, possibly species-specific disease the eradication of which requires a huge effort. This enormous task should include the collaboration of the clinical and basic research for the development of improved, advanced animal models, which in turn could strengthen our understanding about human asthma.",,I Kurucz;I Szelenyi

However, PEF monitoring is not widespread throughout Japan, except for specialists in respirology and allergology clinics. In 2002, a convenient new questionnaire, the Easy Asthma Program (EAP), was developed to allow precise management of asthma patients even outside specialized institutions. We examined whether this questionnaire was useful for the evaluation of the severity and management of asthmatic patients. The EAP questionnaire consists of four questions about asthmatic events during the interval between visits to the hospital. Before the medical interview, we distributed the EAP questionnaire to patients to complete by themselves. We received 595 effective answers from 105 asthmatic patients and assessed the disease severity based on the EAP questionnaire, which we called the EAP step. The result of the EAP step correlated strongly with the severity of asthma, as determined by doctors following physical examinations (p<0.0001, r= 0.7). Our study also revealed that the EAP step tended to correlate negatively with the predicted PEF values. Thus, the accurate evaluation of the disease severity of asthma based on the Asthma Prevention and Management Guidelines could be provided by the EAP questionnaire, which could be performed in only a few minutes.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18328890/,Natural history of asthma: persistence versus progression-does the beginning predict the end?,"Environmental exposures during the early years and airway obstruction that develops during this time, in conjunction with genetic susceptibility, are important factors in the development of persistent asthma in childhood. Established risk factors for childhood asthma include frequent wheezing during the first 3 years, a parental history of asthma, a history of eczema, allergic rhinitis, wheezing apart from colds, and peripheral blood eosinophilia, as well as allergic sensitization to aeroallergens and certain foods. Risk factors for the development of asthma in adulthood remain ill defined. Moreover, reasons for variability in the clinical course of asthma--persistence in some individuals and progression in others--remain an enigma. The distinction between disease persistence and disease progression suggests that these are different entities or phenotypes. There is currently no consensus on whether disease progression requires either airway inflammation or airway remodeling or the combination of the two. For patients with irreversible airway obstruction, inflammation might, in part, be necessary but perhaps not entirely sufficient to induce the irreversible component, some of which could be attributed to alterations in the structure of the bronchial wall. Intervening with intermittent or daily inhaled corticosteroids in high-risk infants and children does not prevent disease progression or impaired lung growth. These findings, however, might not apply to adults, and further study in adults is needed to determine the effect of inhaled corticosteroid therapy on disease progression.",,Reynold A Panettieri Jr;Ronina Covar;Evalyn Grant;Elizabeth V Hillyer;Leonard Bacharier

The diagnosis of bronchial asthma was confirmed in all patients; however, 4 patients were excluded from the study as they had a baseline PC20 FEV1 histamine > 8 mg/ml. A bronchial challenge test with histamine was performed after nonspecific exposure at the workplace and after a specific bronchoprovocation test in the laboratory; substantial increase in BHR (BHRwork and BHRlab, respectively) was defined as a change in PC20 of at least one doubling concentration. A fall in FEV, of at least 20% from baseline after the specific bronchoprovocation test was defined as a positive response (SBPpos). Six patients had BHRwork and 7 patients had BHRlab; 2 patients had both BHRwork and BHRlab. Five patients had SBPpos, of whom 1 had BHRwork and 1 had BHRlab. None of the patients had three positive tests, i.e., BHRwork, BHRlab, and SBPpos. In 3 patients the specific challenge test caused a pronounced decline of lung function and deterioration in the clinical condition. With the results of the specific challenge test as the gold standard, serial measurement of histamine responsiveness may not appear to be a sensitive diagnostic test for occupational asthma. However, the high number of patients with an increase in BHR after specific and/or nonspecific occupational exposure strongly suggests that changes in bronchial responsiveness may identify patients with respiratory symptoms causally related to occupational exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,C S Ulrik;V Backer;P G Skov

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7952600/,Inflammation in nocturnal asthma?,"At present there is some indirect evidence for increased nocturnal inflammation in patients suffering from nocturnal asthma: 1. Circulating eosinophil numbers and activation, as reflected by increased levels of ECP and EDN and low-density eosinophils, are increased at night. 2. Circulating histamine levels are increased at night. 3. Hyperresponsiveness to AMP at night is increased compared with hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. However, most results of various studies point to nocturnal asthma's being an expression of more severe asthma: 1. Both AMP and propranolol responsiveness, indirect measures of airway hyperresponsiveness, are lower both at 4:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. in asthmatics with nocturnal asthma than those without nocturnal asthma. 2. Patients with nocturnal asthma have higher circulating numbers of eosinophils at both 4:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. than those without nocturnal asthma, and eosinophil survival is not different at these times. 3. Patients with nocturnal asthma have higher PGD2 levels in BAL both at 4:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M. than those without nocturnal asthma, but show no significant difference between levels at these two times. 4. Two studies have shown no difference in BAL eosinophil numbers and activation parameters at night in nocturnal asthma. 5. Histamine levels in BAL fluid are comparable day and night in patients with and without nocturnal asthma. 6. Inflammatory mediators in BAL are higher in asthmatic patients than in normal subjects, but are not different between patients with and without nocturnal asthma. Thus, patients with nocturnal asthmatic symptoms show an overall increased burden of mediators released from mast cells and other inflammatory cells. In conclusion, we feel that the term ""nocturnal asthma"" is misleading, in that it does not describe a unique entity in certain patients with asthma. We prefer, in view of the previous arguments, to consider nocturnal asthma a mere expression of more severe asthma. Thus we suggest the term ""nocturnal asthma"" be changed to ""asthma with nocturnal symptoms.""",,D S Postma;Y Oosterhoff;W M van Aalderen;H F Kauffman;J B Wempe;G H Koëter

This study was conducted as the recruitment effort for Community Action Against Asthma, a randomized trial of a household intervention to reduce exposure to environmental triggers of asthma and was not designed as a classic prevalence study. An asthma screening questionnaire was mailed and/or hand delivered to parents of 9,627 children, aged 5 to 11 years, in two geographic areas of Detroit, Michigan, with predominantly African American and Hispanic populations. Additional questionnaires were distributed via community networking. Measurements included parent report of their child's frequency of respiratory symptoms, presence of physician diagnosis of asthma, and frequency of doctor-prescribed asthma medication usage.

It cannot be included in traditional psychiatric perspectives or psychological scheme. 2. The classical features of behaviour such as dependence and negation of aggressivity can appear frequently but are not specific. 3. In more than one third of cases, a particular system of interaction may occur, called ""allergic relation"", characterized by a) A lack of personal attachment (objectal relationship poorly differentiated), b) A need of fusional grasping to people and environment, c) A blocking-up the separation-individuation system. 4.

This observation has led many to question whether air quality is truly a significant risk factor in the development and exacerbation of asthma and whether further improvement in air quality is likely to result in improved health outcomes. However, epidemiologic studies have shown that levels of pollutants of less than the current ambient air quality standards still result in exacerbations of asthma and are associated with other morbidities as well. Specific locations, such as living near a roadway, might pose a special exposure risk. Genetic factors almost certainly play a role in determining susceptibility to pollutants, such as including those involved with antioxidant defenses. The best studied of these in the context of air pollution risks are glutathione-S-transferase polymorphisms. Irrespective of whether pollutants contribute to the development of asthma or the well-documented increases in asthma results in more people having pollutant-induced disease, poor air quality in many places remains a significant problem for patients with asthma and allergic disease.

Ligation of TLRs results in alterations in the expression of several inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators, which are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. The endosomal TLRs have been shown to be associated with the induction of asthmatic inflammation (TLR3), and with disease exacerbations (TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9). Targeting these receptors seems to be an effective choice for suppressing airway inflammation, eosinophilia and airway hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic patients.

A few patients respond poorly to these drugs, and others need such high doses to control the disease that side-effects become a serious problem. The term steroid resistant asthma is used for both groups. In some patients, factors may be operating to make the asthma worse and, thus, to increase the requirement for steroids. In order to make a clinical diagnosis of steroid resistant asthma, it is therefore necessary to investigate the factors that could be operating to prevent a ""normal"" response to steroids. These factors include wrong diagnosis, insufficient steroid reaching the airway mucosa, continuing exposure to sensitizing agents, unrecognized aggravating agents, excessive use of beta-agonist aerosols, and failure to undertake regular management according to a strict management plan.

Orally expired NO concentration was 2.5+/-0.3 ppb (mean +/-SEM) in healthy control subjects, 3.19+/-0.88 ppb (NS) in symptom-free children, and 8.28+/-0.81 ppb (p< or =0.01) in children with bronchial asthma who had had recent symptoms of bronchial obstruction. Similarly, in the subgroup of children treated regularly with inhaled glucocorticosteroids those with recent symptoms had significantly higher orally exhaled NO concentrations than healthy control subjects (9.5+/-1.5 ppb, p<0.05). The nasal NO concentration was 152.8+/-12.7 ppb in healthy control subjects and not significantly different in asthmatic children. In this group of asthmatic children, recent symptoms of bronchial obstruction were linked to significantly higher concentrations of NO in orally exhaled gas and to increased oral NO excretion rates. If substantiated by further studies, measurement of orally exhaled NO during nasal aspiration may become useful to monitor disease control in asthmatic children.",,A Artlich;T Busch;K Lewandowski;S Jonas;L Gortner;K J Falke
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31706484/,School-Based Telemedicine for Asthma Management,"Asthma affects 10% of school-age children in the United States. These numbers nearly double in high-risk populations such as low-income and minority populations. Patients in these populations frequently live in communities that are medically underserved, with limited resources to implement comprehensive asthma interventions. It is important for researchers and clinicians to explore avenues to reduce the burden of illness in this population. Incorporating innovative strategies such as school-based telemedicine programs can potentially reduce morbidity, health care utilization, work absenteeism for caregivers, and school absenteeism for children with asthma. The aim of this review is to discuss the potential benefits of school-based asthma telemedicine programs, explore potential implementation models, and provide a comprehensive review of the literature including programs that use telemedicine in schools to assist with the management of asthma. Telemedicine is a feasible approach to increasing access to primary and specialty asthma care; however, there is a need for future randomized trials to establish best practices for implementation of telemedicine programs to aid in the care for children in school settings.",Asthma; Pediatric; School-based; Telemedicine.,Tamara T Perry;Jessica H Turner
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25666876/,SCUBA Diving and Asthma: Clinical Recommendations and Safety,"The objective of this article is to review the available studies regarding asthma and SCUBA (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) diving. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE to identify peer-reviewed articles related to asthma and SCUBA diving using the following keywords: asthma, allergy, and SCUBA diving. SCUBA diving is a popular sport with more than 9 million divers in the USA. SCUBA diving can be a dangerous sport. Bronchospasm can develop in asthmatic patients and cause airway obstruction. Airway obstruction may be localized to the distal airway which prevents gas elimination. Uncontrolled expansion of the distal airway may result in pulmonary barotrauma. There is also the risk of a gas embolism. Asthmatic divers can also aspirate seawater which may induce bronchospasm. Pollen contamination of their oxygen tank may exacerbate atopic asthma in patients. Diving may be hazardous to the lung function of patients with asthma. Despite the risks of SCUBA diving, many asthmatic individuals can dive without serious diving events. Diving evaluations for asthmatic patients have focused on a thorough patient history, spirometry, allergy testing, and bronchial challenges. For patients that wish to dive, their asthma should be well controlled without current chest symptoms. Patients should have a normal spirometry. Some diving societies recommend that an asthmatic patient should successfully pass a bronchial provocation challenge. Recommendations also state that exercise-, emotion-, and cold-induced asthmatics should not dive. Asthmatic patients requiring rescue medication within 48 h should not dive.",Allergy; Asthma; SCUBA diving.,Christopher A Coop;Karla E Adams;Charles N Webb
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20226290/,Asthma in the inner city: the perspective of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,"Since 1991, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has funded four consecutive research initiatives to investigate the problem of high asthma prevalence, morbidity and mortality in poor urban communities. The multi-site studies conducted under these initiatives have identified key risk factors for asthma morbidity and novel interventions to improve asthma control. NIAID focuses its asthma and allergy programs on understanding the interaction of the immune system with allergens and infectious agents and identifying genetic and epigenetic elements that influence the immune system. A key goal in this field is to define mechanisms of immune system deviation and immune tolerance and apply this knowledge to generate improvements in asthma care and allergen immunotherapy. A related goal is to further understand the environmental, social, and immunological elements that impact on the development of inner-city asthma through in-depth characterization and longitudinal follow-up of inner-city children from the time of birth. In the past 5 years, NIH budgetary constraints have imposed many challenges for the academic research community.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18833639/,Asthma: where is it going?,"Asthma is characterized by reversible airway obstruction, airway hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Although our understanding of its pathophysiological mechanisms continues to evolve, the relative contributions of airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation are still debated. The first mechanism identified as important for asthma was bronchial hyperresponsiveness. In a second step, asthma was recognized also as an inflammatory disease, with chronic inflammation inducing structural changes or remodeling. However, persistence of airway dysfunction despite inflammatory control is observed in chronic severe asthma of both adults and children. More recently, a potential role for epithelial-mesenchymal communication or transition is emerging, with epithelial injury often resulting in a self-sustaining phenotype of wound repair modulation by activation/reactivation of the epithelial-mesenchymal trophic unit, suggesting that chronic asthma can be more than an inflammatory disease. It is noteworthy that the gene-environmental interactions critical for the development of a full asthma phenotype involve processes similar to those occurring in branching morphogenesis. In addition, a central role for airway smooth muscle in the pathogenesis of the disease has been explored, highlighting its secretory function as well as different intrinsic properties compared to normal subjects. These new concepts can potentially shed light on the mechanisms underlying some asthma phenotypes and improve our understanding of the disease in terms of the therapeutic strategies to be applied. How we understand asthma and its mechanisms along time will be the focus of this overview.",,D S Faffe

The objective was to evaluate if serum and Respiratory Gene Technology (RGT), a commercial kit to produce autologous conditioned serum, was effective in reducing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophils and mast cells in racehorses with cytological evidence of mild equine asthma . Thirty-six Standardbred trotters in active training were enrolled in this randomized clinical trial; a healthy control group (n=11), a RGT group (n=12) and a serum group (n=13). Endoscopy including tracheal wash (TW) and BAL was performed before (T0), after a 6-week treatment period including 12 intramuscular injections of RGT or serum (T6) and as a follow-up 10 weeks after treatment (T16). A significant decrease in BAL neutrophils for the RGT group was found between T0 and T6 (P = .002, d=-1.51, CI: -2.43;-0.59) and for the serum group between T0-T6 (P = .002, d=-1.36, CI: -2.26;-0.46).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23113366/,[Physical training for the treatment of children presenting with bronchial asthma],"This paper reports the results of the treatment of 101 children presenting with bronchial asthma. The study has demonstrated the pronounced positive effect of the combined application of a pulsed low-frequency electrostatic field and therapeutic physical training on the dynamics of clinical symptoms of the disease. By the end of the treatment period, all the patients reported the disappearance of paroxysmal night-time coughing, productive cough, expectoration, and attacks of respiratory distress. Auscultation failed to reveal dry, whistling, and bubbling rales. Dynamics of the changes of the impaired airway patency was estimated from the results of computed pneumotachometry and monitoring peak expiratory flow by the peak flowmetric technique. The combined application of a pulsed low-frequency electrostatic field and therapeutic physical training significantly improved characteristics of the external expiratory function (PEF, FEV1, MEFR25, MEFR50--p < 0.02, MEFR75--p < 0.001). In the end of therapy, 96.7% of the children had normal parameters of computed flowmetry in the absence of a generalized impairment of bronchial patency while obstruction at the level of peripheral bronchi persisted only in 3.3% of the patients. The increase of PEF based on the results of peak flowmetry averaged 44.21% (p < 0.001).

We studied 796 consecutive children with asthma (mean (SD) age 9 (4) yrs) attending a hospital clinic, to determine whether these nocturnal symptoms predicted that daytime activities would be affected, and also the patients' perception of disease severity. At the end of a regular out-patient clinic visit, the answers to seven different questions concerning nocturnal symptoms in the previous 3 weeks were recorded. The forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was > or = 90% predicted in 98% of the population that was able to perform lung function measurements (72% of the total population). In 38% of the patients with nocturnal symptoms, these symptoms were reported spontaneously. When asked for, nocturnal symptoms were reported by 47% of the children; 6% every night and 34% at least once a week. Cough was the most frequently reported symptom (31%). Children with nocturnal symptoms had a lower FEV1, scored their perception of asthma as more severe, and had their daytime activities affected more than those without nocturnal symptoms.

In western countries, industrial pollution has greatly decreased while photochemical pollution has remained stable or increased depending on the area. In animal models, all types of air pollution, at high concentration, have an effect on the airways: irritation, facilitation of allergic sensitization, reduced resistance to infections. In humans, is the prevalence of asthma higher in polluted areas? Most surveys have found that the prevalence of respiratory, ear-nose-throat, and bronchial symptoms is higher but not symptoms of asthma. The surveys comparing East and West Germany suggest that irritation (repeated rhinobronchitis) is related to acid-particle pollution. The higher prevalence of allergic diseases in ex-West Germany does not appear to be related to photochemical pollution but rather to western lifestyle in general. In addition, changes in air pollution have an effect on the clinical and functional score in asthma patients, affecting the demand for medication and health care. Of particular importance for health care is the fact that these effects occur at concentrations below ""standard"" levels of pollution.",,D Charpin;D Vervloet

National Cooperative Inner-City Asthma Study,"Previous research has demonstrated a significant reciprocal relationship between psychosocial factors and asthma morbidity in children. The National Cooperative Inner-City Asthma Study investigated both asthma-specific and non-specific psychosocial variables, including asthma knowledge beliefs and management behavior, caregiver and child adjustment, life stress, and social support. This article presents these psychosocial characteristics in 1,528 4-9-year-old asthmatic urban children and their caretakers. Caretakers demonstrated considerable asthma knowledge, averaging 84% correct responses on the Asthma Information Quiz. However, respondents provided less than one helpful response for each hypothetical problem situation involving asthma care, and most respondents had more than one undesirable response, indicating a potentially dangerous or maladaptive action. Both adults and children reported multiple caretakers responsible for asthma management (adult report: average 3.4, including the child); in addition, children rated their responsibility for self-care significantly higher than did adults. Scores on the Child Behavior Checklist indicated increased problems compared to normative samples (57.3 vs. 50, respectively), and 35% of children met the criteria for problems of clinical severity. On the Brief Symptom Inventory, adults reported elevated levels of psychological distress (56.02 vs norm of 50); 50% of caretakers had symptoms of clinical severity. Caretakers also experienced an average of 8.13 undesirable life events in the 12 months preceding the baseline interview. These findings suggest that limited asthma problem-solving skills, multiple asthma managers, child and adult adjustment problems, and high levels of life stress are significant concerns for this group and may place the inner-city children in this study population at increased risk for problems related to adherence to asthma management regimens and for asthma morbidity.",,S Wade;C Weil;G Holden;H Mitchell;R Evans 3rd;D Kruszon-Moran;L Bauman;E Crain;P Eggleston;M Kattan;C Kercsmar;F Leickly;F Malveaux;H J Wedner

The authors now wondered whether such differences could be established in other age groups. The present study (in 1996) included 14,299 subjects, aged 5-75 yrs, of a random sample of the general population in the same two adjacent areas: the centre of Antwerp (Belgium) and its south suburban border. The standardized European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) and International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaires were used to assess the occurrence of asthma-related symptoms. Higher rates were confirmed in urban compared to suburban Antwerp in adults (20-75 yrs), but no such area differences were found in children (5-8 and 12-15 yrs). Adjustment for a number of recorded risk factors did not seem to affect the area differences in asthma-related symptoms. Comparing the survey results of 1991 and 1996 in 20-44 yr old adults, the findings suggest a slight increase in reported respiratory symptoms in both areas. A higher occurrence of asthma symptoms was observed in the urban than suburban area in adults, but not in children.

However, ibuprofen, a NSAID sold over the counter in most countries, is commonly given to children for relief of fever and mild-to-moderate pain. Consequently, increased risk of acute bronchospasm induced by ibuprofen in children with asthma remains a persistent concern. More recently, the assumption that children with asthma are at a greater risk for exacerbations of their disease if they take ibuprofen has been questioned. There is little evidence to measurably increases morbidity in the great majority of children with asthma. In addition, recent evidence suggest that ibuprofen measurably increases morbidity in the great majority of [corrected] children with asthma. Given the infrequent occurrence of aspirin/NSAID sensitivity in children with asthma, it seems reasonable to allow the use of ibuprofen in this population unless there is a personal or family history of aspirin-induced asthma. In addition, the inflammatory pathogenesis of asthma, anti-inflammatory effect of ibuprofen, and evidence suggesting ibuprofen may reduce morbidity in children with asthma raises the intriguing possibility that ibuprofen might actually have therapeutic benefit for at least some children with asthma.",,Ralph E Kauffman;Mary Lieh-Lai

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25365198/,[The relationship between rhinitis and asthma: is that all?],"The link between upper and lower airways has been observed in the past, but only carefully investigated during the last years. Allergic rhinitis and asthma are often comorbid conditions. Its relationship is supported by epidemiological, anatomical and physiological, immunopathological, clinical and therapeutic studies, mostly related to allergic rhinitis. Rhinitis and asthma occur together at rates that greatly exceed what would be expected from the baseline prevalence of each disorder alone. Many researchers have considered rhinitis as a risk factor for developing asthma. Also, the severity of rhinitis has been directly correlated with the severity of asthma although less evidence supporting the reverse impact. Different clinical and experimental observations suggested the hypothesis of the unity of upper and lower respiratory tract. Evidence suggests that rhinitis and asthma are different facets of a broader systemic inflammatory process involving upper and lower airways. Treatment of rhinitis simultaneously produces a favorable effect on symptoms of asthma and concurrent improvement in lung function and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. In this article, we review the most relevant epidemiological, genetic and clinical evidence linking rhinitis and asthma, the possible mechanisms of the nose-lung interaction and the rational basis of a set treatment that support the hypothesis of ""one airway, one disease ""considering aspects not yet clarified on the subject.",,María Fernanda Agresta;Ricardo J Saranz;Natalia A Lozano;Alejandro Lozano

Two tools can be used: 1) notification in a diary of daily symptoms; 2) serial assessment of peak expiratory flow rates and FEV1. These methods are widely suggested and interesting. However, several aspects including the compliance of asthmatic subjects with the assessment, remained to be examined. According to cross-sectional studies, serial measurement of non-allergic bronchial responsiveness is significantly related to the clinical and functional severity of asthma. Nevertheless, longitudinal studies do not show a satisfactory correlation. The reason for these discrepancies is unknown.

Exacerbations are largely driven by environmental exposures including pollutants, stress, and viral and bacterial pathogens. These exposures are most likely to induce acute severe ""asthma attacks"" in high-risk patients. These personal risk factors for exacerbations can vary with the phenotype of asthma and age of the patient. In children, allergic sensitization is a strong risk factor, especially for those children who develop sensitization early in life. Airway inflammation is an important risk factor, and biomarkers are under evaluation for utility in detecting eosinophilic and type 2 inflammation and neutrophilic inflammation as indicators of risk for recurrent exacerbations. Insights into inflammatory mechanisms have led to new approaches to prevent exacerbations using mAb-based biologics that target specific type 2 pathways. Challenges remain in developing an evidence base to support precision interventions with these effective yet expensive therapies, and in determining whether these treatments will be safe and effective in young children. Unfortunately, there has been less progress in developing treatments for acute exacerbations. Hopefully, greater understanding of mechanisms relating airway viruses, bacteria, mucin production, and neutrophilic inflammatory responses will lead to additional treatment options for patients experiencing acute exacerbations.",Corticosteroids; Exacerbation-prone asthma; Precision interventions; Type 2 inflammation.,Loren C Denlinger;Peter Heymann;Rene Lutter;James E Gern

Experience with 39 patients undergoing ventilation for status asthmaticus,"Thirty-nine asthmatic patients required mechanical ventilation (IPPV) for status asthamticus over a seven and a half year period. We reviewed their clinical records with particular emphasis on the events leading to intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) and the long-term courses of those patients who survived IPPV. Long delays by patients before seeking medical attention, incomplete assessment of acute attacks, underuse of corticosteroids prior to admission and overuse of sedation were important factors often influencing the necessity for IPPV. Four patients died during IPPV. Of the 35 who survived, 32 were regularly followed in our Respiratory Clinic. Nine patients subsequently died, eight undoubtedly from asthma. Serial measurements of forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) were retrospectively analyzed to determine patterns of asthma. Of the 23 patients still alive, 14 have well controlled asthma, five have a pattern of persistent airflow obstruction, two have markedly labile asthma, and two have gradually deteriorating airflow obstruction. By contrast, seven patients who died sufficiently long after IPPV to enable categorization of their patterns showed either markedly labile asthma or gradually deteriorating airflow obstruction. None had relatively constant ventilatory function at either normal or suboptimal levels. We suggest that patterns of asthma are useful guides in detecting patients at high-risk.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31748421/,CD8 + Tc2 cells: underappreciated contributors to severe asthma,"The complexity of asthma is underscored by the number of cell types and mediators implicated in the pathogenesis of this heterogeneous syndrome. Type 2 CD4+ T-cells (Th2) and more recently, type 2 innate lymphoid cells dominate current descriptions of asthma pathogenesis. However, another important source of these type 2 cytokines, especially interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13, are CD8+ T-cells, which are increasingly proposed to play an important role in asthma pathogenesis, because they are abundant and are comparatively insensitive to corticosteroids. Many common triggers of asthma exacerbations are mediated via corticosteroid-resistant pathways involving neutrophils and CD8+ T-cells. Extensive murine data reveal the plasticity of CD8+ T-cells and their capacity to enhance airway inflammation and airway dysfunction. In humans, Tc2 cells are predominant in fatal asthma, while in stable state, severe eosinophilic asthma is associated with greater numbers of Tc2 than Th2 cells in blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and bronchial biopsies. Tc2 cells strongly express CRTH2, the receptor for prostaglandin D2, the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 and the leukotriene B4 receptor. When activated, these elicit Tc2 cell chemotaxis and production of chemokines and type 2 and other cytokines, resulting directly or indirectly in eosinophil recruitment and survival. These factors position CD8+ Tc2 cells as important and underappreciated effector cells contributing to asthma pathogenesis. Here, we review recent advances and new insights in understanding the pro-asthmatic functions of CD8+ T-cells in eosinophilic asthma, especially corticosteroid-resistant asthma, and the molecular mechanisms underlying their pathologic effector function.",,Timothy S C Hinks;Ryan D Hoyle;Erwin W Gelfand

Although psychological stimuli could trigger the occurrence of attacks of bronchial asthma, they are not an exclusive etiological factor (Iamandescu, 1980, 1985). In the context of large groups of asthma with allergic or other etiology, forms of asthma that are triggered by an additional psychogenic factor could be identified. These are noted in 62.5% of hospitalized patients, most cases with a prolonged and more severe evolution of the disease, but in only 30% of light and moderately severe cases that are followed up in outpatient (Iamandescu, 1980, 1984). The percent of psychological trigger is maximum (86%) in corticodependent asthma patients (Iamandescu, 1996). Somatic and psychological background of asthma with psychogenic triggering is represented by the following: (1) an obvious relationship between psychological stimuli and the onset of asthma attacks, and a psychological terrain ""endowed"" with an increased vulnerability to stress. These patients present a diminished rate of cortisol response to stress compared with asthma patients without psychogenic triggering; (2) reversibility to broncho-dilator agents, in contrast with resistance to systemic corticoid therapy; (3) sensitivity to aspirin; (4) endocrine dysfunctions (high estrogen and thyroid hormones secretion); (5) multi-factorial triggering of the attacks (especially non-specific respiratory irritants, including physical-chemical factors and meteorological changes) (1985); (6) variable response to psychotherapy and psychotropic drugs, suggesting--in case of therapeutic failure--the predominance of the chronic inflammation determined by other etiologic agents, different from psychological stress.",,I B Iamandescu;Alexandra Mihăilescu

A review of past and recent psychophysiological and clinical studies of both adults and children presents the methodologic and analytic approaches that have been applied to quantify perceptual accuracy. Peak expiratory flow rate, forced expiratory volume in the first second, and force expiratory flow can serve as objective measures of asthma. A visual analog scale, a numerical guess, and a categorical description as subjective measures all have clear strengths and weaknesses. Correlational analysis of subjective-objective data, arithmetic differences between subjective guess and objective value, and an error grid categorization can each be applied to calculate an accuracy index on an individual subject. Illustrative examples reveal that the same data lead to different indices depending on the method chosen. Empirical research is needed to standardize various methodologic approaches.

There is little evidence of the effectiveness of disease management guidelines in rural clinical practice. The effect of disease management guidelines on clinical outcomes and quality of life in asthmatic patients in a rural community hospital was examined. Fifty-seven patients aged > or = 16 years with physician-diagnosed asthma from a hospital outpatient clinic in Ubon-ratchathani, Thailand, were recruited. Asthma diagnosis was confirmed by reviewing clinical records. We implemented a 12-week disease management program, including the use of written asthma treatment plan and asthma action plan tailored to individual patients. Using one-group pre- and post-intervention design, we compared the average number of emergency visits and hospitalizations from acute asthmatic attacks before and after the implementation of interventions using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test. We also compared patient's asthma quality of life (AQL) scores, measured using the 7-point scaled Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire. It was found that among the 57 patients, 38 (67%) were women, and the mean age (SD) of the patients was 47.6 (17.0) years. Sixteen patients (28%) had a family history of asthma. Emergency visits decreased from 0.48 (SD = 0.83) per patient before implementation of interventions to 0.11 (0.37) per patient after implementation of interventions (p = 0.003). Hospitalizations with acute asthma attacks reduced from 0.14 (0.35) per patient to 0.04 (0.27) per patient (p = 0.034). Overall AQL scores increased significantly from 3.7 to 5.4 (p < 0.001), with most improvement observed in symptoms and emotions. It was concluded that implementation of a 12-week asthma disease management program could reduce emergency visits and hospitalizations, and improve patients' quality of life in a rural practice setting.",,Parinya Chamnan;Kittipa Boonlert;Wanit Pasi;Songkran Yodsiri;Sirinya Pong-on;Bhoonsab Khansa;Pichapat Yongkulwanitchanan
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11142601/,Asthma,"From an epidemiological point of view four issues are briefly emphasized here: the definition of asthma, time trends and regional differences, and risk factors for asthma. Furthermore, I will focus upon a few aspects regarding the relation between exercise and asthma. The definition of asthma has presented problems for those involved in studying the disease in general populations, where the estimates rely solely on reported asthma and respiratory symptoms. A standardized questionnaire does not fully overcome differences in languages and interpretations of the concepts of asthma and wheeze over time and in different communities. Although the belief of an upward trend of childhood asthma seems to be widely accepted, studies with the proper methodology to investigate this issue are scarce. The prevalence of asthma varies within and between countries. There is no clear urban rural gradient, and the prevalence of atopy appears to be higher in western than in eastern Europe. Amazingly little is still known about genetic and environmental factors that are causally related to the manifestation of allergic disorders in previously asymptomatic individuals. The effect of exercise on asthma may be many-sided. Children with asthma can actively take part in sport. However, to what extent extensive exercise may affect the occurrence of bronchial responsiveness is unclear, and among athletes exercise may be a risk factor for the development of ""athlete's asthma"". In conclusion, epidemiological studies have to date not reached their potential due to the lack of longitudinal studies including objective measures of exposures and health outcomes.

To successfully treat a child with asthma, first it is necessary to gain the confidence of the child and his family, next to allay the anxieties of the family and finally to make quite sure that the parents understand the instructions regarding their child's treatment. For these reasons it is plausible to suggest that health education and self-management programs will improve adherence to the therapeutic regimen and will facilitate asthma treatment.

Shared decision-making (SDM) requires that both physician and patients are actively engaged in the decision-making process, including information exchange; expressing treatment preferences; as well as agreement over the final treatment decision. Although SDM appears well supported by patients, practitioners and policymakers alike, the current challenge is to determine how best to make SDM a reality in everyday clinical practice. Within the context of asthma, adherence rates are poor and are linked to outcomes such as reduced asthma control, increased symptoms, healthcare expenditures, and lower patient quality of life. It has been suggested that SDM can improve treatment adherence and that ignoring patients' personal goals and preferences may result in reduced rates of adherence. Furthermore, understanding predictors of poor treatment adherence is a necessary step toward developing effective strategies to improve the patient-reported and clinically important outcomes. Here, we describe why a shared approach to treatment decision-making for asthma has the potential to be an effective tool for improving adherence, with associated clinical and patient-related outcomes. In addition, we explore insights into the reasons why SDM has not been implemented into routine clinical practice.",adherence; asthma; education; prevention; shared decision making.,S Pollard;N Bansback;J M FitzGerld;S Bryan

However, the relationship between EIB and asthma control remains unclear. Exercise limitation due to asthma might lead to reduced physical activity, but little information is available regarding obesity and EIB in asthma. A recent survey evaluated the frequency of EIB and exercise-related respiratory symptoms in a large number of patients with asthma. The survey results were reanalyzed to address any relationship between EIB and asthma control and obesity. A nationwide random sample of children aged 4-12 years (n = 250), adolescents aged 13-17 years (n = 266), and adults aged ≥18 years (n = 1001) with asthma were interviewed by telephone. Questions in the survey addressed asthma symptoms in general, medication use, and height and weight. Asthma control was categorized using established methods in the Expert Panel Report 3. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using standard nomograms and obesity was defined as a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2). Most children (77.6%), adolescents (71.1%), and adults (83.1%) had either ""not well"" or ""very poorly"" controlled asthma. Children with ""not well"" controlled asthma reported a history of EIB significantly more often than those with ""well"" controlled"" asthma. Asthma patients of all ages who had ""not well"" and ""very poorly"" controlled asthma described multiple (four or more) exercise-related respiratory symptoms significantly more often than those with ""well-controlled"" asthma. Obesity was significantly more common in adolescents with ""not well"" and ""very poorly"" controlled asthma and adults with ""very poorly"" controlled asthma. Children, adolescents, and adults with asthma infrequently have well-controlled disease.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21232553/,Remission of asthma: The next therapeutic frontier?,"Asthma treatment goals focus on disease control rather than remission as a therapeutic aim. This is in contrast to diseases where remission is frequently discussed and has well-defined criteria. In this review, we consider the similarities and differences between remission in asthma and another chronic inflammatory disease, rheumatoid arthritis, where new therapies have made remission a realistic treatment goal. Clinical remission of asthma is often defined as prolonged absence of asthma symptoms without requirement for medication while others insist on the demonstration of normal lung function and airway responsiveness. Even in those who develop a symptomatic remission of asthma, persistent physiological abnormalities and airway inflammation are common. There is a clear need to develop a precise, internationally accepted, definition of asthma remission that can be used as a therapeutic endpoint in studies of new asthma treatments. Spontaneous remission of asthma symptoms is relatively common, especially during adolescence. It is more likely in males, those with mild symptoms and normal lung function and in those who quit smoking, and may be linked to normalisation of immune function. Remission is less likely in severe asthma, atopy, eosinophilia, airflow obstruction, continued smoking and weight gain. Studies of spontaneous remissions may provide insight into how remission might be induced with therapy. Remission is not identical to cure, there remains a risk of subsequent symptomatic relapse of asthma and there is little evidence that current asthma treatments can induce remission. Long-term remission should be regarded as the next therapeutic frontier in asthma management.",,John W Upham;Alan L James

Furthermore, the presence of airway inflammation is present even in the absence of severe symptoms. To study the mechanisms by which bronchial inflammation can occur in asthma, a number of models have been developed including the airway response to antigen in allergic subjects. The pattern that has emerged from such studies indicates prompt pulmonary mast-cell activation and the apparent initiation of an inflammatory response. This inflammatory response develops over hours and is important in the later and more persistent development of bronchial obstruction. The eosinophil is an important cell in this process as are proinflammatory cytokines generated from activated lung mononuclear cells. The consequence of this multiple cell, multiple proinflammatory product interaction is the establishment of a self-perpetuating, redundant process by which asthma severity increases.",,W W Busse;W F Calhoun;J D Sedgwick
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8073239/,[Acupuncture and bronchial asthma],"Complementary and alternative medicine is a widespread phenomenon. On the one hand it is demanded by the patients. On the other, practising physicians want to know more about it. The common motive for their interest is the perception that conventional medicine has its limits. This is obvious in the case of bronchial asthma, whose underlying cause is largely unknown despite decades of research, and whose treatment is symptomatic. Furthermore, asthma mortality is not declining. In these circumstances it is legitimate to look for alternatives. One alternative therapy is acupuncture. Although there are many published studies on acupuncture and asthma, few meet the scientific tests necessary to prove the effectiveness of acupuncture. From these studies it emerges that short term effects of acupuncture are better documented than long term ones. Nor is it possible to predict what proportion of asthmatics will respond to acupuncture. Allergic eosinophilic inflammation of the respiratory tract is foremost among present day hypotheses concerning the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of asthma. It is interesting that there are no known clinical or experimental investigations into the effect of acupuncture on allergic inflammation of the asthmatic's bronchial mucosa. In view of these facts we are conducting a long term controlled study of the acute and chronic effects of acupuncture on both allergic inflammation of the bronchial mucosa and asthmatics' clinical symptoms, bronchial hyperreactivity and consumption of medication. To establish responders and non-responders, lung function tests and measurement of microcirculation and skin temperature are carried out before and after acupuncture treatment. If we can show that acupuncture has an effect on the allergic inflammation, this is not only a new pathophysiologic aspect and a further explanation of how the acupuncture effect on asthma comes about. The result also has far-reaching implications for the asthmatic by improving the disease, limiting consumption of medication, preventing side effects and lowering drug costs.",,T C Medici

This is a consensus report of a workshop on mixed disease. Asthma is characterized by a classical clinical history and physical exam, reversible airflow limitation and a high degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. In contrast, history (mostly smoker) and findings in typical COPD are different: COPD patients have little if any bronchial hyperresponsiveness and reversibility of the airflow limitation, respectively. However, beyond the full reversible airflow limitation which excludes COPD or mixed disease, none of these criteria are fully discriminatory. Patients with some of the characteristics of both diseases should be classified as mixed disease. A definitive diagnosis however, should only be assigned in a dynamic process. Once diagnosed the patient should be continuously re-evaluated according to the strength of the diagnosis, since the consequent treatment is important: COPD patients with asthmatic phenotype need early inhaled corticosteroids, even if their FEV1 > 50 %. Moreover, allergen avoidance can be indicated. On the other hand, asthma patients with COPD phenotype could benefit from anticholinergics or--if indicated--pulmonary rehabilitation. Mixed disease should be diagnosed as the coexistence of two distinct entities, i. e. asthma (allergic or intrinsic asthma, whichever is appropriate) and COPD.",,P Kardos;M Brutsche;R Buhl;A Gillissen;K F Rabe;E W Russi;R Sauer;H Worth;G Menz

In the present study, we performed exercise and hyperventilation challenge in the same patients and pulmonary function data and neutrophil chemotactic factor (NCF) in peripheral blood were examined before and after both challenges. Twelve asthmatic patients with normal pulmonary function data on testing days were subjected to exercise test on a bicycle ergometer and then isocapnic hyperventilation tests in subsequent days. Subjects breathed dry air from the cylinder. Isocapnic hyperventilation was performed by monitoring minute ventilation and each patient followed the same minute ventilation exercise. The reduction of FEV1.0 and time course of airway obstruction were almost the same after exercise and hyperventilation testing. All patients who developed EIA also developed HIA and other patients did not develop both EIA and HIA. Changes of Rrs, V50 and V25 and their time course after each test were also similar in EIA(+) and HIA(+), and in EIA(-) and HIA(-). NCF increased significantly after both challenges in EIA(+) and HIA(+) patient, although increment of NCF was much less these the increases of HIA(+). These data may suggest that the development of bronchoconstriction was compatible after exercise and hyperventilation in each asthmatic patient, however, the mechanism of HIA may differ from EIA, although NCF slightly but significantly increased in HIA, suggesting the possible role of a chemical mediator.",,A Ohtsuka;S Koyama;T Yashizawa;H Kikuchi;T Horie
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18395227/,A protein interaction network associated with asthma,"Identifying candidate genes related to complex diseases or traits and mapping their relationships require a system-level analysis at a cellular scale. The objective of the present study is to systematically analyze the complex effects of interrelated genes and provide a framework for revealing their relationships in association with a specific disease (asthma in this case). We observed that protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks associated with asthma have a power-law connectivity distribution as many other biological networks have. The hub nodes and skeleton substructure of the result network are consistent with the prior knowledge about asthma pathways, and also suggest unknown candidate target genes associated with asthma, including GNB2L1, BRCA1, CBL, and VAV1. In particular, GNB2L1 appears to play a very important role in the asthma network through frequent interactions with key proteins in cellular signaling. This network-based approach represents an alternative method for analyzing the complex effects of candidate genes associated with complex diseases and suggesting a list of gene drug targets. The full list of genes and the analysis details are available in the following online supplementary materials: http://biosoft.kaist.ac.kr:8080/resources/asthma_ppi.",,Sohyun Hwang;Seung-Woo Son;Sang Cheol Kim;Young Joo Kim;Hawoong Jeong;Doheon Lee

After a median stay of 15 days, forty-four consecutively admitted children with severe asthma achieved a 93% reduction in hospital days (median, 7 hospital days for the year before treatment versus median 0 hospital days per patient per year at 20 1/2-month follow-up; p less than 0.001) and an 81% reduction in emergency care (median, 4 visits for the year previously versus median, 0.4 visits per patient per year at follow-up; p less than 0.01). There was also a significant reduction in corticosteroid bursts and improvement in FEV1. Unique to this program was mandatory family participation focusing on the child's and family's adaptation to severe asthma and development of family-specific interventions to promote compliance with the treatment regimen. Child and family functioning was assessed at admission and follow-up. Hospital use at follow-up was greater for children from dysfunctional families. Families demonstrating difficulties in disciplining the child with asthma required more hospital days both before admission and at follow-up.

Moreover, the heterogeneous nature of the disease and the presence of various phenotypes make the treatment of asthma challenging and nuanced. Despite the availability of several approved pharmacological treatments, approximately half of patients with asthma in the United States experienced exacerbations in 2016, highlighting the need for effective add-on treatments. Furthermore, asthma control remains suboptimal due to low adherence to medications, poor inhaler technique, and several patient-related factors. Importantly, the primary care setting, in which pharmacists play an integral role, represents a critical environment for providing long-term follow-up care for the effective management of chronic diseases, such as asthma. Pharmacists are uniquely positioned to ensure optimal clinical outcomes in patients with asthma since they have the clinical expertise to educate patients on their disease state and the role of asthma medications, provide training on inhalation technique, address patients' concerns about potential side effects of medications, and improve adherence to therapy. Therefore, in this review article, we discuss the overall role of pharmacists in effective asthma care and management.",asthma; clinical outcomes; inhaler; pharmacists; primary care.,Mary B Bridgeman;Lori A Wilken

Sensitization to environmental allergens is an important risk factor for the development of asthma. Innate immune responses are often mediated by receptors on mononuclear cells whose primary ligands arise from microorganisms. Many pathogens, especially viruses, target epithelial cells and affect the host immune response to those pathogens. The acquired immune response to an allergen is influenced by the nature of the innate immune system. Products of innate immune responses to microbes promote T(H)1-acquired responses. In the absence of T(H)1 responses, T(H)2 responses can dominate. Central to T(H)1/T(H)2 balance is the composition of contaminants that derive from microbes.

The study of potential predictive biomarkers in various media, ranging from invasive sampling (e.g. bronchoscopy) to non-invasive sampling (lung function testing and exhaled breath analysis), was comprehensively reviewed. The evolution in biomarker discovery has resulted in an 'omics' approach, in which hundreds of biomarkers in the field of genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and 'breath-omics' can be simultaneously studied. First, results on gene expression and exhaled breath profiles in predicting an early asthma diagnosis are promising. However, many hurdles need to be overcome before clinical implementation is possible. To reliably predict asthma in a wheezing child, probably a holistic approach is needed, combining clinical information with blood sampling, lung function tests, and potentially exhaled breath analysis.

Nevertheless, little attention has been devoted on the possible preventive measures to reduce the occurrence of this potentially life-threatening event.

A structured approach to the assessment and management of severe asthma may be helpful to the practicing clinician. First, it is important to confirm a diagnosis of asthma. In patients who are either not responding to treatment, or who require high doses of medication to control symptoms, it is highly possible that disease mimickers or comorbidities are present and can inhibit therapeutic responsiveness. The assessment and management of common comorbidities of asthma may dramatically impact disease control and thus medication requirement. Determining medication adherence and optimizing drug dose and delivery may separate out truly severe asthmatics from those not using medications regularly or properly. Next, although true personalized medicine for severe asthma is not yet realized, for those individuals with severe asthma, phenotypic characteristics of each patient may guide which therapeutic options may be most effective for that patient.

Effective management of pediatric asthma involves a complex set of interactions between the parent and child, yet there is a paucity of literature examining these interactions. The main purpose of this study was to identify the child behavior and asthma management tasks parents experience difficulty with. It was hypothesized that the more asthma behavior problems reported, the more problems parents experience in asthma management tasks. Participants in this study were 255 parents of 2-to 10-year-old asthmatic children, recruited via an advertisement placed in school newsletters throughout Australia. Results indicated that the most problematic child asthma behaviors were oppositional behavior, hyperactivity, and aggression, and anxiety was also identified by parents as a concern. The main problematic asthma parenting tasks were entrusting the school, entrusting caregivers, identifying unique symptoms, and identifying and avoiding triggers. More problem asthma behaviors were associated with higher levels of parenting difficulty and more general levels of behavior problems. Parents who reported more dysfunctional parenting styles reported more difficulties with their child's asthma behavior.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2799737/,[Etiopathogenetic aspects of allergic pulmonary diseases in childhood],"Anamnestic findings and clinical signs of wheezing attacks, which respond to beta-2-agonists, are the most important criteria in deciding whether a wheezy bronchitis is already a part of bronchial asthma. In this scope advanced lung function testing permits to search for functional abnormalities already in early childhood. Clinically, a study, carried out in ten ambulatory practices on about 1000 schoolchildren has shown that three diagnostic elements have to be distinguished. An ""obstructive element"" is based on the presence of clinical signs like cough, wheezing and rales. The ""chronic element"" is defined by the duration of the wheezing attacks and the number of attacks. Finally a third element, the ""pulmonary hyperinflation"" must clinically be recognized. The critical goals in the long term management of children with asthma are freedom of symptoms and optimal lung function. In this approach stratification into different aetiopathogenetic groups based on anamnestic, clinical and immuno-allergic findings is helpful and the follow-up of subclinical functional sequelae must be considered by repeated lung function tests. Only by these measures can the ongoing immuno-allergic process of airway inflammation be handled.",,R Kraemer

The nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness is a main clinical feature of bronchial asthma, but it also can occur in the course of other diseases, respiratory and cardiovascular. It can also develop as a transient disturbance in healthy subjects. Manifestation of symptoms of bronchial hyperresponsiveness is associated with genetic predisposition and develops as the consequence of exposure to environmental factors. Examination of nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness is used in the clinical diagnostic of bronchial asthma and other respiratory diseases and in epidemiological studies concerning the natural history of bronchial asthma in the population. Simple methods assessing the bronchial hyperreactivity in the epidemiological studies are the very valuable part of research protocol and should be used more widely than are used now.",,R Złotkowska
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9507443/,Cytokine networks in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma: implications for therapy,"Bronchial asthma is characterised by a multicellular inflammatory process in the airways. The bronchial inflammation is orchestrated by a network of cytokines and growth factors which includes those encoded by the GM-CSF/IL-4/IL-5 gene cluster on chromosome 5. Their cellular origins are diverse and include both inflammatory and structural cells in the airways. The efficacy of glucocorticoids in the therapy of bronchial asthma may include the ability to disrupt these cytokine networks. The failure of glucocorticoids to provide benefit in some asthmatic patients may be caused by an excess of pro-inflammatory transcription factors which sequester the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), thereby preventing it from exerting its anti-inflammatory effects. Progress is being made in the elucidation of the molecular regulation of the transcription of TH2 cytokine genes. These novel insights may provide future strategies for therapeutic intervention in asthma.",,T H Lee

Recognition of patients at greatest risk for fatal attacks requires identifying those with severe asthma. In our study of 95 adults with asthma, we found that the subjective factors of perceived severity and perceived danger and the objective factors of medications, hospitalizations, history of intubation, and pulmonary function were important markers of asthma severity and risk. Our findings indicate that asthmatic adults make independent self-assessments that generally correlate with objective markers of increased risk of mortality and increased severity of the asthma. The perception of high severity was significantly correlated with depression, panic-fear, frequency of emergency department visits, and with an objective index of risk of death. The latter includes variables obtainable from history alone (number of medications to control symptoms, need for prednisone, prior intubation, and prior recent hospitalization) and is correlated with spirometric indexes of airflow obstruction, occurrence of nocturnal symptoms, and number of emergency department visits.",,S Janson-Bjerklie;S Ferketich;P Benner;G Becker

In asthmatic patients, the concentration of pH in EBC has been found to be decreased and to be related to airway inflammation. The aim of this study was to determine exhaled pH levels during acute asthma exacerbations in relation to pharmacologic treatment in asthmatic children and compare these with control subjects. Twelve asthmatic children with asthma exacerbation and 27 healthy children were enrolled. Clinical observations and pH in EBC before and after standard treatment for asthma attack, based administration of inhaled beta2-agonist, and corticosteroid, according to international Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines, were compared with those in healthy subjects. All children performed skin-prick tests to aeroallergens. Asthmatic children underwent spirometry. Exhaled pH levels were significantly lower in children with asthma exacerbation before treatment (mean ± SD = 7.87 ± 0.66; p = 0.03) but not after treatment (8.11 ± 0.06; p = 0.40) compared with controls (8.12 + 0.19). Intragroup analyses found that condensate pH levels in asthmatic children before treatment were lower, but not significantly, than those after treatment. No correlation was found between pH values and treatment with systemic corticosteroids or lung function. Asthmatic children were atopic in 75% of cases. Levels of pH are decreased in EBC of asthmatic children with exacerbation before treatment.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15481282/,The size of the problem of managing asthma,"Asthma is now the commonest chronic disease in industrialised countries and its prevalence is rising throughout the world. However, despite the availability of very effective treatments many patients with asthma have poorly controlled symptoms and frequent exacerbations, some of which require hospital admission. Important factors contributing to poor asthma control are failure to recognise asthma as a diagnosis, non-implementation of asthma management guidelines and patient non-compliance with therapy. The guidelines themselves have many inherent limitations. Chief among these is that the evidence upon which they are based may be misleading. The evidence used to support recommendations in guidelines is derived from double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in very carefully selected patients who are usually compliant with therapy and instructed in the use of inhalers. In the 'real world' things are very different and patients frequently fail to understand how to use their therapy and are often non-compliant. Reasons for non-compliance are complex and include complicated drug and dosing regimens and inability to use inhaler devices correctly; particularly pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) due to difficulty co-ordinating device activation and inhalation. Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) preclude the need to co-ordinate inspiration with activation, are easy and convenient to use and are environmentally friendly. There is no doubt that the type of inhaler is just as important as the class of drug in the long-term management of asthma. Improvements in inhaled drug delivery will continue to be important in improving asthma management.",,Peter J Barnes

Evidence is accumulating to support a distinct clinical phenotype for patients with asthma who have impaired small airway function. The small airway asthma phenotype, which is prevalent in patients at all steps of management guidelines, seems to be associated with poor disease control. Alternatively, small airway dysfunction might be a sensitive indicator of early disease rather than a phenotype. Conventional coarse-particle inhalers, which emit particles larger than 2 μm, might not address persistent small airway dysfunction in patients with asthma. To target the entire lung with extra-fine particle formulations (smaller than 2 μm) of inhaled corticosteroids alone or in combination with long-acting β-agonists might result in improved long-term asthma control along with a commensurate improvement in small airway function. Prospective randomised controlled trials with extra-fine-particle inhaled drugs are now needed for patients with the small airway asthma phenotype.",,Brian Lipworth;Arvind Manoharan;William Anderson

Maintenance therapy with bronchodilators promptly eliminated the cough in all patients. Three to 12 months later therapy was discontinued for three days, cough returned, and detailed pulmonary-function studies were carried out. Again, base-line values were normal, but after methacholine one-second forced expiratory volume decreased an average of 40 per cent in the patients as compared to 30 per cent in normal controls (P less than 0.001). The point of identical flow was increased by methacholine to 43.5 per cent of vital capacity in the patients, as compared to 6 per cent in normal controls (P less than 0.001), and the alveolar plateau was 4.8 deltaN2 per liter, as compared to 1.4 in normal controls (P less than 0.01). Specific airway conductance was lowered in patients and controls, but the post-methacholine value was significantly lower in the patients.

Although nearly 50% of asthma patients are considered poorly adherent to therapeutic advices, adherence is still difficult to assess, understand and improve despite major medical consequences. In this review, we revisited the literature of the last 10 years related to adherence in severe asthma. The concepts have changed and ""compliance"" is usually replaced by ""adherence"". Assessment of adherence is addressing ethical issues, but provides important insight into difficult-to-treat asthma. Different tools have been used but none is routinely recommended. Health-related outcomes (poor control, exacerbations, hospitalizations, lung function decline), which are clearly associated with severe asthma, are often worsened by non-adherence with consequences also on patient related outcomes (quality of life). The potential behaviour associated with non-adherence and all other related factors including easy-to-recognize psychological traits can help for patient's future management. Therapeutic educational interventions have been recognized with a scientifically proven efficiency even though evolution and improvements are needed. A multidisciplinary approach is required in severe asthma. Therapeutic adherence for a given patient is always a prerequisite to any other aspects when addressing severe asthma phenotypes. Severe asthma should be considered only in those who still experienced poor asthma outcomes despite optimal adherence. At a glance, poor adherence and severe asthma should be considered antinomic.

Because trigger avoidance is an integral part of successful asthma management, psychological triggers in particular may be associated with suboptimal asthma control, given the difficulty of controlling them. We examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of perceived asthma triggers with self-report of asthma control impairment, symptoms, and spirometric lung function (forced expiratory volume in the 1st second, [FEV1]) in 179 adult primary care asthma patients. Perceived asthma triggers explained up to 42.5% of the variance in asthma control and symptoms, but not in FEV1 alone. Allergic triggers explained up to 12.1% of the asthma control and symptom variance, three nonallergic trigger types, air pollution/irritants, physical activity, and infection, explained up to 26.2% over and above allergic triggers, and psychological triggers up to 9.5% over and above all other triggers. Psychological triggers alone explained up to 33.9% of the variance and were the only trigger class that was consistently significant in all final multiple regression models predicting control and symptoms. Psychological triggers also predicted lower asthma control 3-6 months later, although controlling for initial asthma control eliminated this association. In free reports of individually relevant triggers, only psychological triggers were associated with suboptimal asthma control. Trigger factors are important predictors of self-reported asthma control and symptoms but not actual lung function. Particular attention should be directed to psychological triggers as indicators of patients' perceptions of suboptimal asthma control.",,Thomas Ritz;Carol Bobb;Chris Griffiths

Newer cell biological data show a separate regulation of the allergy (interleukin 4, IL-4, pathway) and of the eosinophilic inflammation in asthma (IL-5 pathway). Both conditions require a therapeutic approach. To prevent irreversible bronchial remodeling, early diagnosis and targeted therapy are decisive. Bronchial asthma is regarded as evident when the paroxysmal character of the disease is confirmed and an-at least intermittent-obstructive ventilation disorder is apparent which responds well to short-acting beta2-adrenergic agents. Current asthma treatment has been assured in many studies (evidence level A) and is based on therapy in stages which classifies therapeutic measures depending on four grades of severity. Accordingly, most patients are largely without complaints, and nocturnal attacks are now rare. New medications are intended to overcome any remaining therapeutic weak points. Antileukotrienes and anti-IgE antibodies can contribute to reducing the necessary corticosteroids.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19519921/,"Diet and asthma: looking back, moving forward","Asthma is an increasing global health burden, especially in the western world. Public health interventions are sought to lessen its prevalence or severity, and diet and nutrition have been identified as potential factors. With rapid changes in diet being one of the hallmarks of westernization, nutrition may play a key role in affecting the complex genetics and developmental pathophysiology of asthma. The present review investigates hypotheses about hygiene, antioxidants, lipids and other nutrients, food types and dietary patterns, breastfeeding, probiotics and intestinal microbiota, vitamin D, maternal diet, and genetics. Early hypotheses analyzed population level trends and focused on major dietary factors such as antioxidants and lipids. More recently, larger dietary patterns beyond individual nutrients have been investigated such as obesity, fast foods, and the Mediterranean diet. Despite some promising hypotheses and findings, there has been no conclusive evidence about the role of specific nutrients, food types, or dietary patterns past early childhood on asthma prevalence. However, diet has been linked to the development of the fetus and child. Breastfeeding provides immunological protection when the infant's immune system is immature and a modest protective effect against wheeze in early childhood. Moreover, maternal diet may be a significant factor in the development of the fetal airway and immune system. As asthma is a complex disease of gene-environment interactions, maternal diet may play an epigenetic role in sensitizing fetal airways to respond abnormally to environmental insults. Recent hypotheses show promise in a biological approach in which the effects of dietary factors on individual physiology and immunology are analyzed before expansion into larger population studies. Thus, collaboration is required by various groups in studying this enigma from epidemiologists to geneticists to immunologists. It is now apparent that this multidisciplinary approach is required to move forward and understand the complexity of the interaction of dietary factors and asthma.",,June-Ho Kim;Philippa E Ellwood;M Innes Asher

We further analysed our data trying to specify risk factors for underdiagnosis and undertreatment. Our special interest was focused on female sex as there is evidence for a sex-dependent diagnosis and treatment of chronic disease in adults, called the Yentl syndrome. The data are derived from a parent completed questionnaire survey of a stratified cluster sample of schoolchildren aged 7, 12, and 15 years. Besides the 12 months prevalence of asthma symptoms and bronchodilator treatment, the lifetime prevalence of an asthma diagnosis was noted. With a response rate of 97%, a total of 4353 completed questionnaires were analysed. While age was not associated with undertreatment (except for exercise-induced symptoms in adolescents), the lack of a formal diagnosis of asthma and atypical asthma symptoms other than wheeze such as chronic night cough were confirmed as significant risk factors for undertreatment. Of all boys reporting asthma symptoms 31% received bronchodilator treatment compared with only 15% of the symptom-reporting girls (P < 0.001). For all particular asthma-related symptoms (except wheeze), significantly more boys than girls (approximately double) received treatment.

Specific treatment goals include but are not limited to decreasing inflammation, improving lung function, decreasing clinical symptoms, reducing hospital stays and emergency department visits, reducing work or school absences, and reducing the need for rescue medications. Non-pharmacological management strategies include allergen avoidance, environmental evaluation for allergens and irritants, patient education, allergy testing, regular monitoring of lung function, and the use of asthma management plans, asthma control tests, peak flow meters, and asthma diaries. Achieving asthma treatment goals reduces direct and indirect costs of asthma and is economically cost-effective. Treatment in children presents unique challenges in diagnosis and management. Challenges in diagnosis include consideration of other diseases such as viral respiratory illnesses or vocal cord dysfunction. Challenges in management include evaluation of the child's ability to use inhalers and peak flow meters and the management of exercise-induced asthma.",,Christopher Chang

Omics technologies made a huge leap from trendy and very expensive to routinely executed and relatively cheap assays. Simultaneously, we understood that omics is not a panacea for every problem in the area of human health and personalized medicine. Whilst in some areas of research omics showed immediate results, in other fields, including asthma, it only allowed us to identify the incredibly complicated molecular processes. Along with their possibilities, omics technologies also bring many issues connected to sample collection, analyses and interpretation. It is often impossible to separate the intrinsic imperfection of omics from asthma heterogeneity. Still, many insights and directions from applied omics were acquired-presumable phenotypic clusters of patients, plausible biomarkers and potential pathways involved. Omics technologies develop rapidly, bringing improvements also to asthma research. These improvements, together with our growing understanding of asthma subphenotypes and underlying cellular processes, will likely play a role in asthma management strategies.",asthma; biomarkers; omics; personalized medicine; systems biology.,Olga Ivanova;Levi B Richards;Susanne J Vijverberg;Anne H Neerincx;Anirban Sinha;Peter J Sterk;Anke H Maitland-van der Zee

There was a higher incidence of positive family history of asthma in this group (34%) than in those patients without nasal symptoms (15%). In the majority of the cases (69%) the nasal symptoms started before or at the same time as the onset of asthma; the most common symptoms being rhinorrhoea in 105 (82%) and sneezing in 101 (79%) of the patients. In 59 (46%) of the cases where a definite relationship could be established, nasal symptoms immediately preceded, precipitated or accompanied acute asthmatic episodes. Such cases improve significantly, in the severity of the asthmatic symptoms, with treatment directed at the nasal condition, and it is therefore suggested that the presence of persistent nasal symptoms be looked for as aggravating factors in asthmatics, and their underlying cause treated.",,L N Jarikre;F O Ogisi

Although the prospective studies used different criteria to stratify the severity of the patients' asthma, their conclusions were remarkably similar. Over-all, an equal number of women have asthma symptoms that improve, worsen, or are unchanged through pregnancy. Asthma symptoms can worsen during pregnancy because of identifiable factors, such as infection, gastroesophageal re-flux disease, reduction of appropriate medications by physician or patient, and smoking. Undertreatment, which remains a problem during pregnancy, can lead to continued difficulty with asthma. Severe asthmatics tend to have increased symptoms compared with mild asthmatics. If symptoms worsen, it usually occurs in the second and third trimesters, with the peak in the sixth month. Generally, there is improvement in asthma in the last 4 weeks of pregnancy. During labor and delivery, only 10% to 20% of asthmatics have symptoms;severe asthmatics are more likely to have exacerbations. Asthma tends to return to the prepregnancy state within 3 months post partum. Successive pregnancies tend to have a similar course in each individual. Every asthmatic woman should be maintained on appropriate medications and followed carefully throughout pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimesters. Asthma specialists should be available for collaborative care when asthma is uncontrolled, or if there is an exacerbation.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1455762/,[Bronchial asthma. Pathogenesis and clinical aspects],"Asthma bronchiale (a.b.) is defined as paroxysmal or permanent, partly or completely reversible dyspnoea due to a bronchospasm resulting from pathological hyperreactivity of the bronchial system. In the pathogenesis participate allergic, immuno-infiltrative and genetic factors, irritating substances (environment) and infectious. The allergic constituent acts via sensitization and allergization of the mast cell, to its degranulation with release of mediators (histamine, serotonin, leukotrienes, thromboxane, PAF) with subsequent bronchoconstriction and production of viscous mucus. As to adrenergic factors, a block of beta-adrenergic receptors and reduced adrenal function is involved. As to non-adrenergic factors an increased sensitivity of the parasympathetic--vagus is involved which conditions bronchoconstriction and hyperkrinia. From the clinical aspect extrinsic (atopic) and intrinsic (cryptogenic) asthma bronchiale can be differentiated. The former is encountered more frequently in childhood and adolescence, in subjects with a positive family-history, high IgE and positive skin tests and a known allergen. The latter type of a.b. is found in adolescence, in subjects with a negative family-history, with eosinophilia; it is conditioned by infection (e.g. chronic bronchitis), strain, cold and takes a dangerous course (aspirin). As to the course, attacks of a.b. are involved with a symptom-free interval (extrinsic a.) easily controlled by treatment. Then there is the chronic form with a variable course and the necessity of permanent treatment. Status asthmaticus is in recent years with increasing frequency the cause of death and thus calls for maximal treatment. It is the third most serious form of a.b. Assessment of arterial blood gases is very important as a check of treatment as well as from the prognostic aspect (cross-over intubation). From the differential diagnostic aspect we must consider the asthmoid component in chronic bronchitis, pulmonary embolism, left-sided cardiac failure, tracheal or bronchial compression by an aortal aneurysm, tumour.

The latest onset may be induced by the characteristics of the environment, as happens in most adults (occupational asthma).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19124353/,Worldwide differences on the concept of control of asthma,"Asthma is estimated to affect approximately 4-11% of the general population and its prevalence is increasing continuously. A large number of epidemiological studies on the prevalence of asthma and the level of disease control have been carried out, in which the level of control defined by GINA objectives was shown to be significantly unsatisfactory. Frequently, patients accept suboptimal levels of asthma control, mainly because they do not know how asthma is caused and how it can be treated. Apart from having a deep negative impact on patient's daily life, undiagnosed and undercontrolled asthma can also mean an increased economic burden. Therefore, greater attention should be paid to preventive measures, patient education and self-management programmes. Scientific evidence exists that drugs currently available can achieve all or almost all the objectives indicated by international guidelines in the majority of patients, and to improve patients' HRQL by minimizing the impact of the disease and its treatment from the patient's viewpoint. In conclusion, there is a gap between the level of control that could be reached and what is obtained in real life.

Furthermore, it is associated with reduced numbers of eosinophils and higher numbers of mast cells in the submucosa of the airway wall. Airway remodeling is increased as evidenced by increased epithelial thickness and goblet cell hyperplasia in smoking asthmatics. The pathogenesis responsible for smoking-induced changes in airway inflammation and remodeling in asthma is complex and largely unknown. The underlying mechanism of reduced corticosteroid responsiveness is also unknown. This article discusses differences between smoking and nonsmoking asthmatics regarding the clinical expression of asthma, lung function, response to corticosteroids, airway inflammation and remodeling processes.

The authors of this supplement seek to emphasize the importance of early recognition, prompt and coordinated evaluation, and treatment of CAS in the emergency department, hospital, and intensive care units by experienced healthcare provider teams. CAS is not severe persistent asthma where control of symptoms and prevention of exacerbations are targets of chronic disease management in the outpatient setting. The authors address the distinctions between the two entities throughout the supplement, and elaborate on the considerations important in the care of a critically ill patient, including the common errors to avoid. In addition, gaps in knowledge and clinical experience in regards to critical asthma are highlighted. Knowledge gaps include a lack of understanding of how to recognize CAS, how to coordinate and integrate hospital and outpatient resources, when to further phenotype patients with critical asthma in order to facilitate effective treatment, and how to prevent future acute exacerbations. Lastly, CAS is complicated by the fact that asthma care in diverse healthcare settings is haphazard. We recommend that primary care physicians refer patients promptly to an asthma specialist for consultation to reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations and prevent the development of CAS.",,Nicholas Kenyon;Amir A Zeki;Timothy E Albertson;Samuel Louie
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17547853/,The role of environmental tobacco smoke in the origins and progression of asthma,"Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is a major source of indoor air pollution and causes adverse effects on the respiratory health of individuals with asthma. At least one third of children and adults with asthma are exposed to ETS on a regular basis. There is convincing evidence for a causal relationship between exposure to ETS and development of asthma in children and in nonsmoking adults. Exposure to ETS also worsens asthma control in children and nonsmoking adults who have established asthma. The mechanism by which ETS causes these harmful effects is not established but may involve genetic predisposition, impairment of lung development, and altered lung inflammatory responses. Workplace smoking restrictions and reduced smoking in the home may lower the prevalence of asthma, improve asthma control, and reduce the use of medical services in both children and adults who are exposed to ETS.",,Neil C Thomson

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11753120/,Measurement of airway inflammation in asthma,"Chronic airway inflammation is considered responsible for symptoms and disorders of airway function associated with asthma. This process is the target of anti-inflammatory therapy, so a number of standardized, noninvasive techniques have been developed to assess it. More recent approaches include the measurement of exhaled gases and nonvolatile substances in breath condensate. Results from studies using a wide variety of inflammatory markers have shown group differences between patients with asthma and healthy control subjects, but evidence for the diagnostic use of these markers in individual patients is scarce. Similarly, despite many studies demonstrating some correlation between markers of airway inflammation and a measure of disease control, none has yet convincingly shown a place for the use of these markers in an individual with corticosteroid-treated asthma. However, application of these markers continues to further our understanding of the disease process and provides the potential for more appropriate, customized therapy.",,Nicola Wilson
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18373959/,A multi-hit endocrine model of intrinsic adult-onset asthma,"Epidemiological studies indicate that adult-onset asthma is initiated by stress (anxiety and depression), obesity and menopause. Ironically, despite our understanding of the various stressors that promote chronic adult-onset asthma, most of which are known to elevate cortisol production via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, inhaled and systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay for the treatment of chronic asthma. This implicates other endocrine or cellular changes independent of cortisol synthesis in non-allergic adult-onset asthma. The mechanism by which corticosteroids are thought to modulate bronchial tone in relieving asthma is via corticosteroid-responsive genes that increase PGE(2) and cAMP production which promote muscle relaxation. Therefore, any physiological condition that suppresses intracellular PGE(2) and cAMP production would counter cortisol-induced muscle relaxation and potentially trigger non-allergic adult-onset asthma. Stress, obesity and menopause act on three interrelated endocrine pathways, the serotonergic, leptinergic and hypothalamic pathways, all of which operate through receptors to modulate cAMP and Ca(2+) metabolism in smooth muscle cells (SMCs). We propose that the level of SMC cAMP, as determined by overall signaling through corticosteroid receptors, leptin receptors and the GPCRs of the HPG and serotonergic pathways, will regulate bronchial tone (i.e. the 'Multi-Hit Endocrine Model of Adult-Onset Asthma'). Thus, decreases in HPG (menopause) and serotonergic (depression) signaling and increases in leptinergic (obesity) signaling relative to HPA signaling would decrease cellular SMC cAMP and promote muscle contraction. This model can explain the discrepant epidemiological data associating stress, obesity, depression and menopause with adult-onset asthma and is supported by basic and clinical data. Treatment of depressed or menopausal asthmatics with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or hormone replacement therapy, respectively, alleviates bronchoconstriction. Future therapeutic strategies might therefore target the serotonergic, leptinergic and hypothalamic pathways in regulating cellular cAMP production and bronchoconstriction for the treatment of adult-onset asthma.",,Craig S Atwood;Richard L Bowen

The affected dimensions were mobility, breathing, sleeping, usual activities, mental function, discomfort and symptoms, depression, distress, vitality and sexual activity. In the Tobit regression analysis, a poorer 15D score was associated with uncontrolled asthma, lower postbronchodilator FEV1, female sex, depression, treated dyspepsia and poorer 15D score at diagnosis.

The language that patients use to describe their breathlessness may provide important clues about the physiology underlying symptoms in a particular patient. Several physiological derangements may contribute to dyspnea in a given individual. The variability in the severity of breathlessness for any given degree of airflow obstruction may relate to differences in the relative importance of these physiological changes and/or to a range of perceptual abilities in asthmatic patients.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8866597/,Increased bronchial responsiveness to exercise as a risk factor for symptomatic asthma: findings from a longitudinal population study of children and adolescents,"The prevalence of asthma seems to be on the increase and risk factors are not well-established. To investigate the relationship between asymptomatic increased bronchial responsiveness to exercise (BRE) and subsequent development of asthma, we studied a population sample of children and adolescents, aged 7-17 yrs at enrollment, examined twice 6 yrs apart (54 and 68%, respectively, of the original sample participated in the two examinations). Complete information was available for 383 subjects (191 males and 192 females). Case history and questionnaire data were obtained and were used to assess the presence or absence of symptomatic asthma. Exercise testing, performed at enrolment only, consisted of steady running on a 10% sloping treadmill for 6 min in a climate chamber. BRE was recorded as percentage fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) from pre-exercise FEV1, within 15 min after exercise. Twenty subjects (5%) had asthma at enrolment, whereas 58 subjects (15%) had current asthma (i.e. symptoms within the preceding 12 months) at the time of follow-up, of whom 40 were asymptomatic at enrolment (new asthma). In general, increased BRE at enrolment was significantly associated with symptomatic asthma at follow-up. Analysing the data for subjects who were asymptomatic at enrolment (n=363), showed that new asthma at follow-up was not predicted by increased BRE at enrolment, whether BRE was evaluated as a continuous (R2=0.06, p=0.13) or dichotomous (cut-off: BRE =10% decline in FEV1; odds ratio (OR) 0.8 (0.4-1.2); p=0.11) variable. However, the data do not exclude the possibility that asymptomatic subjects with BRE >15% have an increased risk for subsequent development of asthma. The findings of the present study suggest that increased bronchial responsiveness to exercise in asymptomatic children and adolescents is not a strong predictor for subsequent development of symptomatic asthma. Further studies, preferably of larger samples, are needed to confirm these findings.",,C S Ulrik;V Backer

The photographs taken by and commentary from student participants were integrated into public service announcements (PSAs) intended to increase community asthma awareness and catalyze behavior change. This article evaluates the effectiveness of these student-directed PSAs at improving asthma awareness among peers and community members. Pre-PSA, immediate post-PSA, and 4 month post-PSA follow-up assessments were conducted to evaluate changes in community members' asthma knowledge and behavior. The student-directed PSAs were found to significantly increase asthma knowledge among community members, irrespective of age, gender, or race. Increased knowledge persisted through the 4-month post-PSA follow-up. Of the thirty-six participants who were successfully contacted for the follow-up survey, nearly 40 % reported meaningful behavior-change in response to the PSAs. Photovoice and media production techniques were effective in engaging adolescent students--an under-served and often disenfranchised population--in asthma health education through the development and dissemination of PSAs.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19822630/,Leukotriene modifiers in the treatment of asthma in children,"Asthma is one of the most common respiratory disorders in clinical practice, affecting up to 13% of people worldwide. Inflammation is the most important component of asthma and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are recommended as the first line controller treatment for patients of all ages. Treatment with corticosteroids is often unable to fully control asthma symptoms and progression. Recently, leukotrienes have come to the forefront of research as they have been found play a pivotal role in the airway inflammatory process, and specific drugs have been developed to target them. Cysteiny leukotriene antagonists (LTRAs) have recently emerged as important therapeutic options that show a large potential clinical utility. Three specific LTRAs are licensed for clinical use: montelukast, zafirlukast and pranlukast, although montelukast is the only drug approved in the paediatric age range. It is well tolerated (although adverse effects such as headaches, abdominal pain, rashes, angioedema, pulmonary eosinophilia and arthralgia have been reported) and shows many positive effects in asthmatic patients. Current Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines recommend LTRAs as: (1) a second choice treatment to ICS for patients with mild persistent asthma, (2) an add-on therapy to reduce the dose of ICS in patients with moderate or severe asthma, due to the different and complementary mechanisms of action of these agents. LTRAs may be particularly appropriate choices in a number of clinical situations, including the following: patients with concomitant rhinitis; patients with viral-induced wheeze; patients with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) and, in children aged 2-5 years, to reduce the frequency of asthma exacerbations.",,Michele Miraglia del Giudice;Assunta Pezzulo;Carlo Capristo;Emilia Alterio;Serena Caggiano;Diletta de Benedictis;Angelo F Capristo

For many asthmatic children living in urban communities, especially those with greater morbidity, the allergic pathway is important in the etiology of the disease. The stages of developing allergic disease can be divided into the onset of allergic sensitization, development of allergic disease and subsequent exacerbations, and it is useful to consider the relevance of interventions at each of these stages. Indoor allergens and environmental exposures are a major contributor to allergic disease, particularly among lower socioeconomic status, urban, minority communities. These exposures include allergens, environmental tobacco smoke, combustion by-products, and mold, all of which can play an important role in asthma progression as well as morbidity. These exposures are often not found in isolation and thus these concomitant exposures need to be considered when conducting environmental interventions. There have been numerous studies looking at both primary and tertiary prevention strategies and the impact on allergic sensitization and asthma with varied results. While the outcomes of these studies have been mixed, what has emerged is the need for tertiary interventions to be targeted to the individual and to reduce all relevant exposures to which an asthmatic child is exposed and sensitized. In addition, effective intervention strategies must also consider other social determinants of asthma morbidity impacting low socioeconomic, urban communities.",Allergens; Combustion by-products; Environmental tobacco smoke; Interventions; Mold.,Laura Conrad;Matthew S Perzanowski

There are several definitions of severe asthma, which have a common theme of poor control despite high dose inhaled corticosteroid treatment. Depending on the definition chosen, the prevalence of severe childhood asthma may be up to 5% within populations with asthma. Collectively, there is some evidence that the treatments used in severe asthma are beneficial, but a solid evidence-base is lacking for many treatments and some treatments have recognized side effects. Evidence supporting the use of maintenance oral prednisolone and intramuscular triamcinolone is weak. Response to systemic corticosteroids is heterogeneous and recognizing phenotypes or endotypes may identify those most likely to gain maximal benefit from treatment. For children aged 6 to 11 years, the anti-IgE biologic omalizumab is effective and anti-IL-5 agent (mepolizumab) has recently been licenced in Europe (but not the US). Biologics, which are licenced for >11 year olds include omalizumab, mepolizumab, benralizumab, reslizumab, and dupilumab. There is plenty that the clinician can offer to the child and adolescent with severe asthma in 2019, including nontherapeutic and therapeutic interventions.

A simple questionnaire was used asking three questions: - Do you wheeze on breathing? - Do you have attacks of breathlessness during the night? - Do you have asthma? 7,904 people were questioned at the Centre for Preventive Medicine at Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy over a year and 1,062 gave a positive response to at least one question. The replies were sub-divided into 5 groups according to the pattern of response and were then given a further clinical assessment as follows: - A sensitivity test for house dust allergy; - A bronchial sensitivity test to Acetylcholine; - The level of blood eosinophilia; - Presence or absence of a family history of asthma. The results were then compared to a matched group of controls who gave a negative reply to all three questions. The authors concluded that the term asthma should only be used by people who recognize themselves as asthmatics and can identify at least one trigger factor in their symptoms. One frequently finds in such people : a family history of asthma, a positive allergy test to the house dust mite, and eosinophilia. On the other hand those with only one or two symptoms (dyspnoea or wheezing) without recognizing themselves as asthmatics had little evidence of a family history of asthma, a sensitivity to the house dust mite comparable to controls and no eosinophilia; in these people there was a striking relationship to tobacco consumption. The Acetylcholine test shows little discriminative value in an epidemiological study of this nature; asthmatics could not be separated from patients with chronic air-flow obstruction, particularly when due to tobacco. It would be helpful to find a test of bronchial hyperactivity which could be used epidemiology.

The elevated level of FeNO in asthma patients was first reported in 1993, and measurement has been covered by insurance in Japan since April 2013. NO is generated through the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline by the action of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and iNOS is highly expressed in asthmatic airways. FeNO is expiratory flow-ependent, and measurement at 50 mL/s is recommended. As a nitrate-rich diet and the contamination of nasal NO increase, and smoking and spirometry decrease FeNO, these factors should be avoided or taken into account when measuring FeNO. For clinical application, FeNO may be used for the diagnosis or as a guide to treat asthma. Although FeNO correlates well with eosinophilic airway inflammation, it is not present in all asthma patients, and eosinophilic bronchitis or a part of COPD also shows eosinophilic inflammation. Thus, FeNO may be used as an adjunct for asthma diagnosis, and in ATS guideline, it is recommended to use FeNO for the diagnosis of eosinophilic airway inflammation and determining the likelihood of responsiveness to steroids. Several studies attempted to use FeNO to determine the dose of ICS (inhaled corticosteroids) and compared FeNO with traditional guideline-based management. The results were inconsistent, and the Cochrane review found that FeNO-based treatment did not lead to a reduction in the ICS dose or improved asthma outcomes. Nevertheless, a study of a pregnant woman showed reduced exacerbations with a refined algorithm, and further research will shed light on the appropriate application of FeNO measurement for asthma management. In this paper, the mechanism of NO generation, background and method of FeNO measurement, and clinical application will be reviewed and an outline of the official ATS clinical practice guideline will be introduced.",,Hiroyuki Nagase
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16580185/,Asthma and COPD,"The two obstructive airway diseases bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represent major global causes of disability and death, and COPD is estimated to become the third most common cause of death by 2020. The structural and pathophysiologic findings in both diseases appear to be easily differentiated in the extremes of clinical presentation. However, a significant overlap may exist in individual patients regarding features such as airway wall thickening on computer tomography or reversibility and airway hyperresponsiveness in lung function tests. Airway inflammation differs between the two diseases. In bronchial asthma, airway inflammation is characterized in most cases by an increased number of activated T-lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ Th2 cells, and sometimes eosinophils and mast cells. The most notable difference of chronic severe asthma compared with mild to moderate asthma is an increased number of neutrophils. In stable COPD, airway inflammation is characterized by an increased number of T-lymphocytes, particularly CD8+ T cells, macrophages and neutrophils. With the progression of the disease severity, macrophage and neutrophil numbers increase. Although there may be a partial overlap between asthma and COPD in some patients, the differences in functional, structural and pharmacological features clearly demonstrate the consensus that asthma and COPD are different diseases along all their stages of severity.",,Tobias Welte;David A Groneberg

With adequate control of the hyperresponsive airways obtained with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and inhaled beta 2 agonists (IBA), used as both a pre-exercise preventive agent and a reliever if necessary, all asthmatics should benefit from an exercise program. Some have realised this benefit with such success as to become Olympic and world champions in many sports. Exercise programs should be individually tailored, follow established guidelines and result in similar benefits to those obtained by non-asthmatics.

This literature review addresses the current state of research in this area. Age-related changes influence the pathophysiology and role of allergy in elderly asthmatic patients. Specific obstacles encountered in caring for these patients are discussed. Asthma in the elderly and younger population are compared.

However, this research is needed to better devise strategies for the prevention of asthma. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences held a conference in October 2004 to collaboratively discuss a future research agenda in this area. The first three articles in this mini-monograph summarize the discussion on potential putative environmental exposure; they include an overview of asthma and conclusions of the workshop participants with respect to public health actions that could currently be applied to the problem and research needs to better understand and control the induction and incidence of asthma, the potential role of indoor/outdoor air pollutants in the induction of asthma), and biologics in the induction of asthma. Susceptibility is a key concept in the U.S. EPA ""Asthma Research Strategy"" document and is associated with the U.S. EPA framework of protecting vulnerable populations from potentially harmful environmental exposures. Genetics, age, and lifestyle (obesity, diet) are major susceptibility factors in the induction of asthma and can interact with environmental exposures either synergistically or antagonistically. Therefore, in this fourth and last article we consider a number of ""susceptibility factors"" that potentially influence the asthmatic response to environmental exposures and propose a framework for developing research hypotheses regarding the effects of environmental exposures on asthma incidence and induction.",,Karin Yeatts;Peter Sly;Stephanie Shore;Scott Weiss;Fernando Martinez;Andrew Geller;Philip Bromberg;Paul Enright;Hillel Koren;David Weissman;MaryJane Selgrade

Indeed, many medications are inadequately labeled for use in children. In general, the younger the child, the less information there is available to guide clinicians. Because asthma often begins in early childhood, it is incumbent on us to continue to address the primary questions raised in this review and carefully evaluate the medications used to manage asthma in children. Meanwhile, continued efforts should be made in defining effective strategies that reduce the risk of exacerbations.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11887043/,Asthma and gastroesophageal reflux in children,"Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is a factor often neglected in the etiopathogenesis of asthma. The estimated incidence of GER in asthmatic children reaches 50-60% and is higher than in the general population. GER may accompany typical symptoms: hoarseness, sore throat, thoracic pain, cough or wheezing. GER may not only aggravate the course of bronchial obstruction, but may also cause it, or trigger obstruction due to other factors. Asthma and GER coincidence has been acknowledged for many years. The paper presents a current review of studies concerning the relations between asthma and GER and attempts to establish, which is the cause and which is the result. The hypotheses how GER can lead to bronchial obstruction, and how obstruction can aggravate GER, are also presented. GER is believed to be a factor causing obstruction by: 1. an indirect mechanism - reflex theory, 2. a direct mechanism - reflux theory, and 3. a neuropeptide-mediated mechanism. The paper also presents diagnostic methods allowing to detect GER in asthmatics. A review of recent studies concerning the treatment of GER in asthmatics, both with pharmacological and surgical methods, is also included. Beneficial effect of antireflux therapy on the course of asthma has been emphasized. Therefore, antireflux therapy is recommended in all patients with concurrent asthma and GER, irrespective of severity of clinical GER symptoms, even in those with silent GER. The essential drugs used in the treatment of GER are proton pump inhibitors.

Reaching the diagnosis of asthma and its management are more difficult than for other chronic illnesses. For example, asthma is a heterogeneous syndrome with many clinical classifications based on patient symptoms, lung function, and response to therapy. The symptoms and objective measurements of lung function, often used to guide therapy, are largely based on the inflammation of the airways. Because measuring airway dysfunction and inflammation in a typical clinical setting is difficult, it is often not done. Metabolomics is the study of small molecules generated from cellular metabolic activity. It is possible that the metabolic profile of a patient with a chronic illness such as asthma is different from that of a healthy patient or from a patient with another respiratory illness. Furthermore, if this metabolome could be measured, it might also vary with disease severity. The pattern of metabolites becomes the diagnostic representing the disease.

We further discuss emerging evidence that active management of asthma during pregnancy can positively influence and perhaps completely mitigate these poor outcomes. Recent high-quality trials examining best methods for asthma treatment are reviewed and synthesized to offer an evidence-based pathway for comprehensive treatment of asthma in the outpatient setting. Safe and effective medications, as well as nonpharmacologic interventions, for asthma during pregnancy are discussed, and treatment options for related conditions of pregnancy, including depression, rhinitis, and gastroesophageal reflux, are presented. Throughout, we emphasize that an effective treatment strategy relies on a detailed patient evaluation, patient education, objective measurement of asthma control, and frequent and supportive follow-up.

There were no significant differences at the 0.05 level between the groups in age, gender, or length of history of asthma. In response to the question pertaining to asthma triggered when upset or anxious, 51% of 57 patients responded to the ""frequently"" or ""always"" category in the IP compared to 19% of 52 in the non-IP.

A high index of suspicion for alternative diagnoses must be maintained when evaluating a patient who presents with clinical features suggestive of asthma, particularly if the patient presents with atypical symptoms or fails to respond to therapy.",,Christopher S King;Lisa K Moores
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12952275/,Pathogenesis of occupational asthma,"The development of occupational asthma (OA) is likely to result from the complex interaction of environmental and host factors. This article addresses a series of issues relating to the multiple environmental factors that could affect the initiation of OA, including the intrinsic characteristics of causative agents, as well as the influence of the level, mode and route of exposure. Although the clinical and pathological features of OA caused by low molecular weight agents resemble those of immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated asthma, the failure to detect specific IgE antibodies against most of these agents and/or poor association with disease status have resulted in intense speculation about alternative or complementary physiopathological mechanisms leading to airway sensitisation. In this contribution, the roles of specific immunoglobulin E and G antibodies, cell-mediated immunity and inflammatory effector cells are critically reviewed. Recent advances in the characterisation of the molecular interactions between chemical sensitisers and human airway proteins provide promising avenues for elucidating the immunological basis of occupational asthma caused by low molecular weight agents.",,J Sastre;O Vandenplas;H S Park
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16828034/,[Use of induced sputum in the investigation of occupational asthma],"The diagnosis of occupational asthma relies mainly on the demonstration of changes in airway calibre and airway responsiveness after exposure to occupational agents in the laboratory or at the workplace. However, spirometry or peak expiratory flow measurements may be open to misinterpretation when they are not performed optimally. As in non-occupational asthma, airway inflammation is one of the main characteristics of occupational asthma. Induced sputum, a non invasive method to assess airway inflammation, has been successfully used in the management of asthma. This article reviews the studies that have investigated and characterized the changes in sputum cell counts occurring in subjects with occupational asthma after exposure to occupational agents in the laboratory or at the workplace in order to assess the place of induced sputum in the investigation of occupational asthma. It also reviews the use of induced sputum during the follow-up of workers with occupational asthma after removal from exposure. This article also describes a new condition identified thanks to the use of induced sputum : occupational eosinophilic bronchitis. In conclusion, induced sputum is a useful tool in the investigation of occupational asthma. Its use on a regular basis in the investigation of occupational asthma also allows for the possibility of diagnosis of overlooked conditions such as occupational eosinophilic bronchitis. Its role in the surveillance of workers at risk to develop occupational asthma remains to be determined.",,Catherine Lemière;Jean-Luc Malo

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9576147/,Age and the impacts of triggers in childhood asthma,"This study examined the relationships among age (2-20 years) and the impacts of 12 common triggers in episodes of childhood asthma. The triggers were: air pollution, allergy problems, cigarette smoke, stress or worry, anger, excitement, laughter, high/low environmental temperature, high humidity, respiratory infection, nighttime hours, and physical activity. Data were analyzed from families with asthmatic children (n = 119) as part of a larger study of biological and psychosocial factors in asthma and other illnesses. Positive correlations were found for age and the trigger impacts of allergy problems (p = 0.025) and physical activity (p = 0.004); negative correlations were found for age and the trigger impacts of nighttime hours (p = 0.002) and respiratory infection (p = 0.002). Age was also negatively correlated with the frequency of recent respiratory infections (p = 0.000) and positively correlated with the intensity of hay fever episodes (p = 0.047). These findings indicate that as children with asthma get older, their asthma episodes are more likely to be influenced by allergy problems and physical activity, and less likely to be associated with nighttime hours and respiratory infections.",,E P Sarafino;M E Paterson;E L Murphy

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19537836/,History of guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma: from opinion to control,"The Global Initiative on Asthma (GINA) was launched in 1993 in collaboration with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the National Institutes of Health (USA) and the WHO. Its first effort was the production of a consensus report on asthma treatment, which aimed to bridge the gap between the various treatment options and the incorporation and implementation of innovative treatment forms into daily clinical practice. The first report published in 1995, A Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention, has been translated into several languages, widely adopted and provided the foundation for several asthma guidelines worldwide. The GINA and other guidelines were primarily based on consensus of expert opinion in order to employ a severity-based classification system as a guide to treatment. However, in the late 1990s, guidelines underwent a major paradigm shift from opinion- to evidence-based classification as the foundation for asthma management. A second major shift involved the classification of asthma according to the level of disease control as a guide to treatment, which was realized for the first time in the revised 2006 GINA guidelines. Since their first appearance, asthma guidelines have played a leading role in disseminating information about asthma. In addition, they have had a substantial impact on standardizing asthma care around the world, which is likely to continue in the future. This article addresses the history of guideline development and issues related to asthma guidelines, with particular emphasis on the GINA guidelines.",,Claus Kroegel;Hubert Wirtz

Major reactive oxygen species that are formed endogenously include hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, and hypohalite radical; and the major antioxidants that fight against the endogenous and environmental oxidants are superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione. Despite the well-known presence of oxidative stress in asthma, studies that target oxidative burden using a variety of nutritional, pharmacological, and environmental approaches have generally been disappointing. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on oxidative stress and antioxidant imbalance in asthma.

Few studies have investigated whether a delay in asthma diagnosis impacts the use of health care services. This study was designed to assess whether a delay in diagnosis of asthma influences the use of health care services. This was a retrospective cohort study with subjects elicited from a convenience sample of 839 healthy children. The criteria for asthma was met in 276 (33%) subjects; of these subjects 179 (65%) had a delay in the diagnosis of asthma and 97 (35%) had a timely diagnosis. Data on health care services (e.g., flu shot, availability of a peak flow meter, hospitalizations, and urgent care or emergency department visits) and the frequency of systemic steroid treatments were collected from medical records during the first 18 years of life. The frequencies of health service and use of systemic steroids were compared using Poisson and logistic regression models in asthmatic children with and without a delay in asthma diagnosis. Children with a delay in asthma diagnosis were more likely to visit urgent care centers at least once (40.8% versus 21.6%; p < 0.001), compared with those with a timely diagnosis. There were no significant differences in other health care service or systemic steroid use. A delay in the diagnosis of asthma was associated with an increase in urgent care visits suggesting suboptimal care.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20525651/,An integrative systems biology approach to understanding pulmonary diseases,"Chronic inflammatory pulmonary diseases such as COPD and asthma are highly prevalent and associated with a major health burden worldwide. Despite a wealth of biologic and clinical information on normal and pathologic airway structure and function, the primary causes and mechanisms of disease remain to a large extent unknown, preventing the development of more efficient diagnosis and treatment. We propose to overcome these limitations through an integrative systems biology research strategy designed to identify the functional and regulatory pathways that play central roles in respiratory pathophysiology, starting with severe asthma. This approach relies on global genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome data sets collected in cross-sectional patient cohorts with high-throughput measurement platforms and integrated with biologic and clinical data to inform predictive multiscale models ranging from the molecular to the organ levels. Working hypotheses formulated on the mechanisms and pathways involved in various disease states are tested through perturbation experiments using model simulation combined with targeted and global technologies in cellular and animal models. The responses observed are compared with those predicted by the initial models, which are refined to account better for the results. Novel perturbation experiments are designed and tested both computationally and experimentally to arbitrate between competing hypotheses. The process is iterated until the derived knowledge allows a better classification and subphenotyping of severe asthma using complex biomarkers, which will facilitate the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic interventions targeting multiple components of the molecular and cellular pathways involved. This can be tested and validated in prospective clinical trials.",,Charles Auffray;Ian M Adcock;Kian Fan Chung;Ratko Djukanovic;Christophe Pison;Peter J Sterk

Guidelines for treatment of asthma are largely based on disease severity and control, rather than underlying mechanisms. However, identification of biomarkers in the causal pathways of asthma is enabling responders to be differentiated from nonresponders. Initial efforts have focused on biomarkers of the T helper (Th)2 pathway because this is a target of novel therapeutics. A concerted effort is now needed to substratify asthma beyond Th2 pathways, and using appropriate biomarkers, to target only those patients likely to respond to a specific biologic. To achieve this goal, a different type of relationship is needed between academia and industry, and also within industry, to promote collaboration in the precompetitive space.",,Stephen T Holgate

However, few studies have assessed the impact of patient satisfaction with an inhaler on adherence and health outcomes. Objective: To assess the impact of patient satisfaction with an inhaler on adherence and health outcomes in asthma. Methods: In a cross-sectional, observational, multicenter study, 778 patients with moderate or severe asthma and who were treated with maintenance inhalers completed a number of scales and questionnaires: the Feeling of Satisfaction with Inhaler (FSI-10) questionnaire, the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication, the Test of Adherence to Inhalers (TAI), the Morisky-Green questionnaire, and the Asthma Control Test (ACT). Results: The study population was categorized according to a median FSI-10 score as high (49.4%) and low (50.6%) satisfaction with their inhaler. Logistic regression analysis showed that high specific satisfaction with an inhaler was associated with the younger age group (odds ratio [OR] 0.976 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.965-0.987]); male gender (OR 1.725 [95% CI 1.187-2.507]); controlled asthma: ACT score ≥ 20 (OR 1.664 [95% CI 1.133-2.445]); high general satisfaction with treatment (OR 4.861 [95% CI 3.335-7.085]); high adherence to inhaler: TAI score ≥ 46 (OR 1.546 [95% CI 1.025-2.332]); nonsevere asthma (OR 1.056 [95% CI 0.648-1.721]); and no trouble with inhaler use (OR 0.401 [95% CI 0.174-0.922]).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8565409/,Chronobiology and chronotherapy of asthma,"There is no doubt that many pathophysiologic conditions change over a 24-hour period and thus therapy needs to be directed at these changes. In particular, asthma has been one of the better-studied disease processes in regard to circadian changes in pathophysiology. As we continue to learn more about circadian changes, better approaches to treating the disease with the same medications will emerge. It should be remembered that many asthmatics do not perceive their degree of bronchoconstriction. This was brought forth in Turner-Warwick's epidemiologic study in that less than one half of the asthmatic individuals who had problems with their asthma every night describe their asthma as being severe. The majority stated they either had mild or moderate asthma. Therefore, it is important that we use objective criteria such as peak flow meters in determining an individual patient's day-to-night changes in lung function.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3325413/,The inflammatory theory of asthma,"In summary, these observations suggest a model for asthma which is summarized in Table III. Initially, mast cells and possibly other bronchial cells, e.g., alveolar macrophages, are activated either in an IgE-dependent or, in intrinsic asthma, in an IgE-independent fashion. These cells release two sets of mediators which may be either preformed or newly synthesized. One set of mediators is responsible for the immediate bronchospastic response. This bronchospasm is transient, readily reversible, and not associated with either airway inflammation or bronchial hyperreactivity. The second set of mediators, however, promote chemotaxis and activation of neutrophils and eosinophils. The subsequent bronchial inflammation causes damage and desquamation of the respiratory epithelium. The increased exposure of irritant receptors results in hyperreactive airways. In addition, these inflammatory cells induce mast cell degranulation and recurrent bronchospasm. Thus, after the initial exposure to allergen, a vicious cycle of inflammation, hyperreactivity and recurrent mast cell degranulation develops, ultimately leading to the pathological picture of chronic asthma.",,L Borish

Asthma is diagnosed in children, especially those aged over 2 years, who have wheezing episodes that improve after a bronchodilator is given (bronchodilator response test). Children are classified as having either intermittent or persistent asthma and treated according to the severity of the disease with either an inhaled bronchodilator (reliever) or a combination of an inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroid (controller). Treatment is best given by inhalation, and as children under 5 years cannot coordinate their breathing with the multidose inhaler, spacers are required. These can be made locally from plastic bottles. Care givers need to be educated about how to manage asthma and should receive a written management plan on the management of the child's asthma. Children should be examined to see if they are allergic to especially airborne allergens, and if these are present they should be removed from the environment. Adult smoking worsens childhood asthma, and care givers need to be given support with smoking cessation. Regular planned follow-up is needed to ensure that the asthma is well controlled and the lowest dose of inhaled corticosteroid is used. Inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids must become freely available and should be inexpensive in low-income countries in order to treat childhood asthma correctly.",,P M Enarson;D A Enarson;R Gie

Patients with severe asthma (previous hospital admissions and/or prescribed step 4-5 treatment according to British Thoracic Society guidelines) considered by clinicians to be either compliant (C, N = 41) or poorly compliant (PC, N = 92) with aspects of their recommended management (attendance at appointments, taking medication, and monitoring asthma) provided data on symptoms, health service use, medication, self-management practices, physical and psychological comorbidities, and sociodemographic/socioeconomic characteristics. Cross-sectional univariate analyses were used to examine whether the groups differed with respect to self-reported indicators of asthma morbidity and self-management. Logistic regressions were additionally used to explore psychosocial factors independently associated with patients being identified as PC. Compared with C patients, PC patients had significantly poorer self-reported asthma control in terms of medication use, symptoms, time off work, asthma-specific quality of life, primary care visits, emergency attendances, and hospital admissions. This was coupled with poorer self-management practices. Patients identified as PC also had higher levels of physical and psychological comorbidities, were younger, and faced more difficult social and economic circumstances. We identified significant psychological (anxiety) and social (younger age, not working, number of benefits, adverse family circumstances) factors independently associated with patients being identified as PC. Among adults with severe asthma, clinician-assessed poor compliance was useful in distinguishing between two groups that differed significantly in terms of asthma morbidity indicators, self-management practices, and psychosocial characteristics, which have been previously shown to be associated with hospital admissions, near-fatal attacks, and fatal asthma.

The pathogenesis of BA contributes to the origin of infectious processes induced by different microorganisms. In view of the predominance of associations of viruses and bacteria in the etiology and pathogenesis of acute respiratory infections, it is difficult to define in vivo the share and role of these microorganisms which participate in the origin and enhancement of hypersensitivity, hyperreactivity and alterations in beta-adrenoreactivity. Some factors of bacterial pathogenicity promote BA progress. On contact with basophils and mast cells bacteria (both pathogenic ones and ordinary commensals) are capable of liberating histamine and other mediators during colonization of the bronchial tree and origin other infectious process. This mechanism of mediator liberation may contribute to the transformation of pre-asthma to BA or provoke its exacerbation.",,L A Vishniakova

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32872366/,Asthma: New Integrative Treatment Strategies for the Next Decades,"Asthma is a chronic disease whose main anatomical-functional alterations are grouped into obstruction, nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity, inflammation and airway remodeling. Currently, the Global Initiative of Asthma 2020 (GINA 2020) suggests classifying it into intermittent cases, slightly persistent, moderately persistent and severely persistent, thus determining the correct guidelines for its therapy. In general, the drugs used for its management are divided into two groups, those with a potential bronchodilator and the controlling agents of inflammation. However, asthmatic treatments continue to evolve, and notable advances have been made possible in biological therapy with monoclonal antibodies and in the relationship between this disease and oxidative stress. This opens a new path to dietary and herbal strategies and the use of antioxidants as a possible therapy that supports conventional pharmacological treatments and reduces their doses and/or adverse effects. This review compiles information from different published research on risk factors, pathophysiology, classification, diagnosis and the main treatments; likewise, it synthesizes the current evidence of herbal medicine for its control. Studies on integrative medicine (IM) therapies for asthmatic control are critically reviewed. An integrative approach to the prevention and management of asthma warrants consideration in clinical practice. The intention is to encourage health professionals and scientists to expand the horizons of basic and clinical research (preclinical, clinical and integrative medicine) on asthma control.",antioxidants; asthma; diagnosis; oxidative stress; treatment strategies.,Diego A Arteaga-Badillo;Jacqueline Portillo-Reyes;Nancy Vargas-Mendoza;José A Morales-González;Jeannett A Izquierdo-Vega;Manuel Sánchez-Gutiérrez;Isela Álvarez-González;Ángel Morales-González;Eduardo Madrigal-Bujaidar;Eduardo Madrigal-Santillán

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15140417/,Steroid resistance in asthma: a major problem requiring novel solutions or a non-issue?,"Steroid insensitivity in severe asthma is rare but has huge health care costs. Thus, 5% of asthmatic patients account for approximately 50% of total health care costs. Incorrect diagnosis, non-compliance with therapy and psychological problems are all confounding issues, and can account for a failure to respond to steroids in many of these patients. A recent report (ENFUMOSA) has suggested that severe asthma, of which steroid-resistant asthma is a component, consists of at least one, possibly more, distinct disease(s) with differing pathologies. Future studies such as Bio-Air and TENOR could confirm this; therefore, it is not surprising that well-characterised steroid-resistant and steroid-dependent asthma have multiple mechanisms to account for a lack of steroid sensitivity, including defective ligand binding to the steroid receptor, abnormal receptor nuclear translocation and abnormal association with pro-inflammatory nuclear proteins. Distinct treatments might have to be tailored to the individual patient; for example, drugs that enhance receptor nuclear translocation will only be effective in patients in whom this is a problem. Once issues of diagnosis, compliance and psychological disorders have been resolved, true steroid resistance or dependence is unlikely to be an issue for most clinicians, who will rarely, if ever, see these patients. However, management of those few patients with true steroid resistance will require novel therapies tailored to specific subgroups of patients.",,Ian M Adcock;Kazuhiro Ito
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11831444/,The cost of asthma treatment in Spain and rationalizing the expense,"According to Weiss et al. [12], the main providers of asthma care in the United States in 1992 were general and family medicine + internal medicine (46%), pediatrics (19%), allergy (25%), pulmonary medicine (5%), and others (5%). In an overall climate of a shift of referral from primary care to the specialties, specialists will have to provide evidence that their intervention in the control of patients provides truly better clinical and economical outcomes than that of general practitioners. In order to support this hypothesis, we estimated: (1) the development of the costs of medication for asthma in a population of 40 million people (Spain) and (2) the correlation between these costs and the intervention of a specialized attendance. In Spain the annual costs incurring from allergic diseases are estimated to be approximately 1,500 million Euros and, the cost due to asthma alone is about 900-1,200 million Euros. There are two main ways to explain the size of these figures. First, the prevalence of allergic diseases is rising year by year. Second, the relevance of allergology in the control of asthma is often greatly reduced. This has resulted in a reduction in the etiological diagnosis and treatment with specific immunotherapy (SIT). However, SIT is the only specific causal treatment of allergic asthma that is able to modify the natural history of disease or disease progression. So, it is possible to hypothesize that this reduction in a proper etiological diagnosis and treatment could be a cause (among others) of increasing costs.",,A Nieto;E Alvarez-Cuesta;M Boquete;A Mazón;F de la Torre

Ninety eight per cent of the parents were receiving medication for asthma. Fifty one per cent had visited their doctor and 20% had taken more than five days off work in the previous 12 months; 12% had been admitted to hospital during the preceding 10 years. In the children the prevalences of wheeze, shortness of breath, and cough were all about double that found in a general population survey of children of similar age. Atopy was present in 90% of parents, but the prevalence of atopy among the children was not significantly different from the children in the general population. Eczema and hay fever, however, had high prevalences of 40% and 24%, respectively. Responsiveness to methacholine (provocation dose achieving 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second less than 6.4 mumol) was found in 93% of parents and 45% of children, which is compatible with a large increase compared with the general population. All atopic but only 50% of non-atopic children with symptoms of asthma responded to methacholine.

The patterns of early and late reactions were qualitatively very similar regarding variables of pulmonary physiological function, but there were quantitative differences. Patients with dual reactions showed significantly greater changes in FEV1, RV and TGV during the early response than those with isolated early reactions. Maximum mid-expiratory flow rates with the patients breathing air and a mixture of He and O2 were measured before and 6 hr after the challenges. Four of five patients with both an immediate and a late response showed a decrease in the response to helium during the latter phase, suggesting increasing involvement of the small airways. An increase in the slope of the alveolar plateau (phase III) was observed in four of the five patients with dual responses and all five had increased CC%. It was concluded that the changes in pulmonary function occurring during the dual responses were widespread, involving the airways generally and resembling those in the clinically more severe asthma.

In order to investigate this question, 26 farmers with occupational asthma were challenged with an exposure to work-related dusts for up to 60 min. This resulted in highly significant increases in airway resistance (Raw), thoracic gas volume (TGV) and specific airway resistance (sRaw) compared to baseline values. After a mean period of 21 weeks the farmers were subjected to a second challenge, this time wearing a protective respiratory device (RD) with a P2 filter. Significant increases in Raw, TGV and sRaw were again observed, but on average these were 50-80% smaller than the increases seen when RDs were not worn. These differences were found to be statistically significant. This shows that the use of a respiratory device in farmers suffering from occupational asthma reduces the development of bronchial obstruction but does not prevent it. The use of this kind of respiratory device cannot substitute for the proper management of asthma since the devices do not offer complete protection.",,D Müller-Wening;M Neuhauss

It also presents significant individual variability over time. Recently, some important population-based studies that followed children from birth or from early childhood into adulthood have shed new light on how we understand this syndrome. Three phenotypes have been identified in children with asthma: transient wheezing, non-atopic wheezing of the toddler and pre-school-aged child and IgE-mediated wheezing. Transient wheezing is associated with symptoms that are limited to the first 3-5 years of life, decreased lung function, maternal smoking during pregnancy and exposure to other siblings or children at daycare centres. There is no association between transient wheezing and family history of asthma or allergic sensitisation. Children wheezing with respiratory syncytial virus in the first years of life are more likely to be wheezing up to 13 years of age; this is independent of atopy (non-atopic wheezers) and is not related to atopic sensitisation. Wheezing associated with evidence of allergic sensitisation has been identified as the 'classic' asthma phenotype.

Equine pasture asthma, formerly summer pasture RAO, is clinically similar but affects grazing horses during hot, humid conditions in the southeastern United States and United Kingdom. To advance translational relevance of equine pasture asthma to human asthma, histologic features of airway remodeling in human asthma were scored in lung lobes from 15 pasture asthma-affected and 9 control horses of mixed breeds. All noncartilaginous airways were scored using a standardized grading rubric (0-3) in hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Movat's pentachrome-stained sections; 15 airways were chosen randomly from each lobe for analysis. Logistic regression identified disease, age, and lobe effects on probability of histologic outcomes. Airway smooth muscle (odds ratio [OR] = 2.5, P < .001), goblet cell hyperplasia/metaplasia (OR = 37.6, P < .0001), peribronchiolar elastic system fibers (OR = 4.2, P < .001), peribronchiolar fibrosis (OR = 3.8, P = .01), airway occlusion by mucus/inflammation (OR = 4.2, P = .04), and airway adventitial inflammation (OR = 3.0, P = .01) were significantly greater in diseased airways. A novel complex tissue disorganization, designated terminal bronchiolar remodeling, was overrepresented in diseased airways (OR = 3.7, P < .0001). Distribution of terminal bronchiolar remodeling corresponded to putative sites of air trapping in human asthma, at secondary pulmonary lobules. Age (>15 years) was an independent risk factor for increased peribronchiolar fibrosis, elastic system fibers, and terminal bronchiolar remodeling. Remodeling differed significantly between lung lobes, congruent with nonhomogeneous remodeling in human asthma. Equine pasture asthma recapitulates airway remodeling in human asthma in a manner not achieved in induced animal asthma models, endorsing its translational relevance for human asthma investigation.",airway remodeling; animal; disease models; equine asthma; heaves; horses; lungs; summer pasture-associated recurrent airway obstruction (SPARAO); terminal bronchiolar remodeling.,Claudenir R Ferrari;Jim Cooley;Nisma Mujahid;Lais R Costa;Robert W Wills;Melanie E Johnson;Cyprianna E Swiderski
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11503516/,Pathophysiological mechanisms of asthma. Application of cell and molecular biology techniques,"Asthma is a common increasing and relapsing disease that is associated with genetic and environmental factors such as respiratory viruses and allergens. It causes significant morbidity and mortality. The changes occurring in the airways consist of a chronic eosinophilic and lymphocytic inflammation, together with epithelial and structural remodeling and proliferation, and altered matrix proteins, which underlie airway wall narrowing and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR). Several inflammatory mediators released from inflammatory cells such as histamine and cysteinyl-leukotrienes induce bronchoconstriction, mucus production, plasma exudation, and BHR. Increased expression of T-helper 2 (Th2)-derived cytokines such as interleukin-4 and 5 (IL-4, 5) have been observed in the airway mucosa, and these may cause IgE production and terminal differentiation of eosinophils. Chemoattractant cytokines (chemokines) such as eotaxin may be responsible for the chemoattraction of eosinophils to the airways. The initiating events are unclear but may be genetically determined and may be linked to the development of a Th2-skewed allergen-specific immunological memory. The use of molecular biology techniques on tissues obtained from asthmatics is increasing our understanding of the pathophysiology of asthma. With the application of functional genomics and the ability to transfer or delete genes, important pathways underlying the cause if asthma will be unraveled. The important outcome of this is that new preventive and curative treatments may ensue.",,K F Chung;I M Adcock
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31736954/,Ozone Pollution: A Major Health Hazard Worldwide,"Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released into the atmosphere can react in the presence of solar irradiation, leading to ozone formation in the troposphere. Historically, before clean air regulations were implemented to control NOx and VOCs, ozone concentrations were high enough to exert acute effects such as eye and nose irritation, respiratory disease emergencies, and lung function impairment. At or above current regulatory standards, day-to-day variations in ozone concentrations have been positively associated with asthma incidence and daily non-accidental mortality rate. Emerging evidence has shown that both short-term and long-term exposures to ozone, at concentrations below the current regulatory standards, were associated with increased mortality due to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The pathophysiology to support the epidemiologic associations between mortality and morbidity and ozone centers at the chemical and toxicological property of ozone as a strong oxidant, being able to induce oxidative damages to cells and the lining fluids of the airways, and immune-inflammatory responses within and beyond the lung. These new findings add substantially to the existing challenges in controlling ozone pollution. For example, in the United States in 2016, 90% of non-compliance to the national ambient air quality standards was due to ozone whereas only 10% was due to particulate matter and other regulated pollutants. Climate change, through creating atmospheric conditions favoring ozone formation, has been and will continue to increase ozone concentrations in many parts of world. Worldwide, ozone is responsible for several hundreds of thousands of premature deaths and tens of millions of asthma-related emergency room visits annually. To combat ozone pollution globally, more aggressive reductions in fossil fuel consumption are needed to cut NOx and VOCs as well as greenhouse gas emissions. Meanwhile, preventive and therapeutic strategies are needed to alleviate the detrimental effects of ozone especially in more susceptible individuals. Interventional trials in humans are needed to evaluate the efficacy of antioxidants and ozone-scavenging compounds that have shown promising results in animal studies.",air quality standards; cardiovascular health effects; climate change; mitigation strategies; ozone; respiratory health effects.,Junfeng Jim Zhang;Yongjie Wei;Zhangfu Fang

Within the scope of the SIDRIA-2 project, this article describes the main aspects of diagnosis, management and treatment of asthma in children (6/7 years old) and adolescents (13/14 years old). The information was obtained from the SIDRIA questionnaire completed by the parents. The analysis of data demonstrated some relevant differences between the actual management of asthma in the paediatric age in Italy and the suggestions available from the guidelines and the literature. Moreover, some choices in the management of asthma were associated to the socio-economic level of families of children and adolescents, such as a lower use of spirometry and a higher frequency of hospitalization in disadvantaged subjects.",,Marta Bellasio;Riccardo Pistelli;Franca Rusconi;Nicola Caranci;Gabriella Frasca;Manuela De Sario;Michele Rana;Stefania La Grutta;Claudia Galassi;Gruppo Collaborativo SIDRIA-2
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10673468/,The importance of spirometry in COPD and asthma: effect on approach to management,"COPD is characterized by airflow limitation. The diagnosis is suggested by history and physical examination and is confirmed by spirometry (ie, a low FEV(1) level that is unresponsive to bronchodilators). Once diagnosed, there is no widely accepted staging or severity scoring system. COPD presently is graded using a single measurement such as FEV(1), which, unlike the case with asthma, has a limited role in disease management. A more comprehensive staging system is required incorporating, for example, age, arterial blood gases, dyspnea, body mass index, and distance walked, in addition to FEV(1). These criteria should allow for more evidence-based recommendations for management of this condition. Asthma is an inflammatory disease also characterized by airflow limitation. But in contrast with COPD, the airflow limitation is highly reversible either spontaneously or with therapy. Repeated lung function measurements using portable peak flowmeters have resulted in improved outcomes. Therefore, frequent flow determination is recommended in the routine management of asthma. Treatment with anti-inflammatory agents and close monitoring of lung function should help decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with asthma.",,B R Celli

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9416559/,Rhinitis and asthma: nasal provocation test in the diagnosis of asthma,"Our purpose was to determine if the study of rhinitis is useful in the diagnosis of asthma. We formulated the hypothesis that the inflammation of the upper airway reflects the inflammation of the lower airway. It was found that there are allergens that produce rhinitis more frequently than asthma, and vice versa. This can be explained by size. This explanation, however, is questionable as the allergic proteins are extracted from the carrying agent, and through the lymphatic route or the blood, reach the entire human organism. It was also found that with bronchoalveolar lavage in allergic asthma it is possible to obtain the same results for eosinophils as with a nasal wash or using Citospyn. However, the results in the late phase are questionable. In the immediate phase and in the late phase, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) was detected in the blood (in asthma) and in nasal washes (in rhinitis). In the immediate response tryptase was detected from the mast cells. The role of leukotrienes in asthma and rhinitis is well established in the early and late response. The use of leukotriene inhibitors guarantee their importance in the airway. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) has been demonstrated to increase vascular permeability and the use of antagonists were the best nasal feature. The inhalation of histamine caused bronchospasm, while instillation of histamine in the nasal passages increased resistance. With this information it seems that our hypothesis has been confirmed. Rhinitis and BHR together are equivalent to asthma, although the PFER decreases during the course of nasal provocation test (NPT) in nonasthmatic patients. In pure rhinitis patients, however, we find decreases in PFER due to effort. All this suggests that the study of nasal inflammation is still unclear with regard to bronchial inflammation.",,A Olivé Pérez
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22794683/,Chapter 10: Pediatric asthma: principles and treatment,"Approximately one-half of children with asthma present with symptoms before 3 years of age. The typical history describes recurrent episodes of wheezing and/or cough triggered by a viral upper respiratory infection, activity, or changes in weather or seasons. When symptoms occur after a viral respiratory infection, children with asthma often take longer than the usual week to recover fully from their respiratory symptoms. Wheezing and coughing during exercise or during laughing or crying and episodes triggered in the absence of infection suggest asthma. A trial of bronchodilator medication should show symptomatic improvement. The goal of asthma therapy is to keep children ""symptom free"" by preventing chronic symptoms, maintaining lung function, and allowing for normal daily activities. Avoidance of triggers identified by history, such as second-hand cigarette smoke exposure and allergens identified by skin-prick testing, can significantly reduce symptoms. According to the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program 2007 report (Expert Panel Report 3 [EPR-3]. Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma: Summary report 2007. J Allergy Clin Immunol 120:S94-S138, 2007.), if impairment symptoms are present >2 days/week or 2 nights/mo, the disease process is characterized as persistent, and in all age groupings, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are recommended as the preferred daily controller therapy. Other controller medications such as cromolyn must be given three to four times a day and provides less efficacy than ICS. Montelukast is approved for children ≥12 months old and is often used for its ease of daily oral dosing. Long-acting beta(2)-adrenergic agonists should not be used as monotherapy (i.e., should only be used with ICS).",,Rachel G Robison;Rajesh Kumar

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14763365/,General principals of management: education,"Asthma education is an essential part of the treatment of this disease. Health care professionals must establish a partnership with the patient with asthma and the patient's family to devise a plan of care with which the patient voluntarily will comply. The partnership with the patient begins at the first encounter and continues throughout the therapeutic relationship. Each member of the health care team can be instrumental in reinforcing the crucial information the patient must know to be an informed participant in his or her care. Nursing professionals are in a particularly advantageous position to foster this partnership because of their patient-focused outlook and the quality of time spent with patients. When the partnership is based on mutual trust and cooperation, the clinician can direct asthma care that is consistent with current expert guidelines. Educational interventions should be meaningful to the patient, learner centered to incorporate the patient's needs, and sensitive to the patient's cultural influences. The patient and his or her significant social and family support should be actively involved. The clinician should be alert to the patient's readiness to learn and tailor the message to suit the setting in which it is delivered. The patient should receive information that allows his or her participation in goal setting for treatment. Essentials to be included are the significance of the diagnosis, basics about inflammation as the primary cause of symptoms, the difference between controllers and relievers, how to use the medications and monitoring devices, how to reach the provider, and the need for continuous ongoing interaction with the clinician. Goals set in the partnership are objectified in the asthma action plan or guided self-management plan. The success of the treatment can be assessed from the patient's improved asthma control and reduced reliance on emergency treatment. Every health care provider is a potential wealth of patient education. Every patient encounter is an opportunity to reinforce knowledge and proficiency in asthma management.

On admission they were supposed to have or had already been diagnosed to have bronchial asthma. Numerous data from the patients' history were evaluated as well as the results of allergy tests (skin tests, RIST, RAST, eosinophils in the blood and sputum) and parameters of the functional lung diagnostics (blood gas analysis during rest and exercise, spirometry, flow-volume, body plethysmography). It was established that allergy diagnostics is not carried out as required, even though it is necessary in all chronic obstructive lung diseases. Skin tests, inspite of the problems on the standardization of allergens and the average number of positive reactions in healthy volunteers, represent a significant diagnostic method for the determination of the role of allergic reaction in bronchial asthma. It is necessary to combine them with the determining level for specific IgE in serum (RAST), which would, if the other conditions are satisfactory, be a basis for specific immunotherapy. The value of skin tests is greater since a good correlation between them and bronchial sensibility was found established by specific broncho-provocative testing. The correlation between eosinophils in the blood and the sputum with allergic sensibilization in asthma was not confirmed in this work.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22805462/,Do small airway abnormalities characterize asthma phenotypes? In search of proof,"The role of small airway abnormalities in asthma pathogenesis has been extensively studied and debated for several decades. However, whether or not small airway abnormalities play a relevant role in specific phenotypes of asthmatic patients and contribute to clinical presentation is largely unknown. In the present review, we evaluated available data on the role of small airways in severe asthma, with a further focus on asthma in smokers and asthma in the elderly. These phenotypes are characterized by a poor response to treatment and they can represent a model of greater small airway impairment. In severe asthmatics, small airway involvement has been shown through evidence of both distal inflammation and of increased air trapping. The few available data on asthmatics who smoke, and elderly asthmatics, similarly suggests that small airway abnormalities contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. In this perspective, there could be a rationale for specifically assessing small airway impairment in these patients and for clinical studies evaluating whether pharmacological approaches targeting the more peripheral airways result in clinical benefits beyond conventional therapy.",,M Contoli;M Kraft;Q Hamid;J Bousquet;K F Rabe;L M Fabbri;A Papi
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1796014/,Pathogenesis of asthma,"Asthma is the most common chronic lower respiratory tract condition in children. Thus, it is imperative that physicians caring for asthmatic patients understand the pathophysiology of asthma and its implications for optimal therapeutic management. A precise understanding of asthma pathophysiology has been impeded due to the fact that a universally acceptable definition for asthma has been difficult to formulate. Clinicians treating asthmatic patients should be aware that the airway obstruction present in these individuals is the result of multiple interrelated factors. Although bronchial smooth muscle spasm can be effectively treated producing rapid symptomatic relief, other factors contributing to airway obstruction, such as airway inflammation and edema, need to be a major focus of therapeutic strategies for more chronic management. While the concepts of reversibility and hyperresponsiveness have been appreciated for some time, the idea that asthma should be viewed as an inflammatory lung disease (or syndrome) has only recently received appropriate emphasis. In this regard, the late phase asthmatic response has provided a convenient model to study the biochemical and cellular interactions that contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma. Further, these responses will aid in the analysis of the potential beneficial effects of various pharmaceuticals as they undergo development and testing for use in asthmatic patients.",,K K Sheth;R F Lemanske Jr
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28903951/,Managing problematic severe asthma: beyond the guidelines,"This review discusses issues related to managing problematic severe asthma in children and young people. A small minority of children have genuinely severe asthma symptoms which are difficult to control. Children with genuinely severe asthma need investigations and treatments beyond those described within conventional guidelines. However, the majority of children with poor symptom control despite high-intensity treatment achieve improvement in their asthma control once attention has been paid to the basics of asthma management. Basic asthma management requires optimisation of inhaler technique and treatment adherence, avoidance of environmental triggers and self-management education. It is also important that clinicians recognise risk factors that predispose patients to asthma exacerbations and potentially life-threatening attacks. These correctable issues need to be tackled in partnership with children and young people and their families. This requires a coordinated approach between professionals across healthcare settings. Establishing appropriate infrastructure for coordinated asthma care benefits not only those with problematic severe asthma, but also the wider asthma population as similar correctable issues exist for children with asthma of all severities. Investigation and management of genuine severe asthma requires specialist multidisciplinary expertise and a systematic approach to characterising patients' asthma phenotypes and delivering individualised care.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30978325/,Exosomes: A new approach to asthma pathology,"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways with a complex pathophysiology, making the development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools a challenge. Exosomes are extracellular membranous nanovesicles implicated in intercellular communication. Exosome composition and cargo are highly heterogeneous depending on their cellular origin and physiological state. They contain proteins (tetraspanins, heat-shock proteins), nucleic acids (RNA, microRNA), and lipids (ceramides, cholesterol, sphingolipids). Current scientific advances show that exosomes play a pivotal role in the pathology of asthma as well as other inflammatory diseases, and all types of inflammatory cells (neutrophils, dendritic cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils) release exosomes. Also, structural lung cells such as airway epithelial cells and airway smooth muscle cells produce and secrete these nanovesicles. Exosomes influence and modify the functionality of these inflammatory and structural cells, triggering the characteristic processes of asthma disease. Additionally, exosomes are used as biomarkers in several disorders because they are easier to collect from different biofluids, making them a non-invasive method for screening human pathologies. Also, due to their special molecular characteristics, they can be loaded with different molecules and employed as a drug-delivery vehicle.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17983880/,Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR-3): Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma-Summary Report 2007,"Highlights of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program's Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR-3): Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma-Full Report 2007 are presented in this EPR-3 summary report. The updated guidelines emphasize the importance of asthma control. Asthma control is the degree to which the manifestations of asthma are minimized by therapeutic intervention and the goals of therapy are met. Because asthma is highly variable, the level of control must be monitored on a periodic basis to determine whether therapy should be maintained or adjusted (stepped up if necessary, stepped down if possible). On the other hand, asthma severity is the intrinsic intensity of the disease process, most easily and directly measured in a patient not receiving long-term control therapy. For managing asthma, the recommendation is to assess severity to initiate therapy and assess control to adjust therapy. Recommendations for managing asthma include an expanded section on childhood asthma with addition of an age group 5 to 11 years old (earlier guidelines combined this group with adults). The guidelines provide new recommendations on patient education in settings beyond the physician's office, and new advice for controlling environmental factors that can cause asthma symptoms. The concepts of current impairment (frequency and intensity of symptoms, low lung function, and limitations of daily activities) and future risk (likelihood of exacerbations, progressive loss of lung function, or adverse side effects from medications) support a new approach to assessing and monitoring the patient's level of asthma control through use of multiple measures. The guidelines stress that some patients can still be at high risk for frequent exacerbations even if they have few day-to-day effects of asthma.Moreover, EPR-3 confirms the importance of teaching patients skills to self-monitor and manage asthma and to use a written asthma action plan, which should include instructions for daily treatment and ways to recognize and handle worsening asthma. New recommendations encourage expanding educational opportunities to reach patients in a variety of settings, such as pharmacies, schools, community centers, and patients' homes. A new section addresses the need for clinician education programs to improve communication with patients and to use system-wide approaches to integrate the guidelines into health care practice. The guidelines describe new evidence for using multiple approaches to limit exposure to allergens and other substances that can worsen asthma; research shows that single steps are rarely sufficient. EPR-3 also expands the section on common conditions that can affect asthma and notes that management of these conditions may help to improve asthma control. Expert Panel Report 3 continues the use of a stepwise approach to control asthma. When assessing the level of asthma control to determine the need for adjusting therapy, EPR-3 reconfirms the importance of assessing patient adherence to medication, inhaler technique, and environmental control measures before making a step up in therapy. The stepwise approach expands from 4 steps to 6 steps of care. Medications have been repositioned within these 6 steps. Recommendations on medications are updated to reflect the latest evidence on effectiveness and safety. EPR-3 reaffirms that patients with persistent asthma need both long-term control medications to control asthma and prevent exacerbations and quick-relief medication for symptoms, as needed. EPR-3 also reaffirms that inhaled corticosteroids are the most effective long-term control medication across all age groups. New recommendations on treatment options such as leukotriene receptor antagonists and cromolyn for long-term control; long-acting beta-agonists as adjunct therapy with inhaled corticosteroids; omalizumab for severe asthma; and albuterol, levalbuterol, and corticosteroids for acute exacerbations are included.",,National Asthma Education and Prevention Program

Ten normal and 10 age-matched asymptomatic subjects with asthma inhaled, with a standardized single breath maneuver, a dry aerosol (mass median aerodynamic diameter, 1.5 micron; geometric SD, 2.1) generated from solutions of methacholine at concentrations ranging from 0.078 mg/ml to 80 mg/ml in buffered saline, mixed with a fixed concentration of the fluorescent tracer quinine. The mass of methacholine deposited was calculated from the fluorescence of the inspired and expired aerosol trapped on an absolute filter before inspiration and during expiration. Specific airway conductance (SGaw) was measured before and after the inhalation of increasing concentration of methacholine, and the provocative deposited mass corresponding to a 35% decrease in SGaw was calculated. Baseline aerosol deposition (quinine-labeled buffered saline) ranged from 63% to 94% and was similar in normal subjects (mean 85%) and asymptomatic subjects with asthma (mean 84%). There was a correlation between the decrease in SGaw and methacholine mass deposited at first dose in the normal subjects (p less than 0.001) but not in asymptomatic subjects with asthma. Mean provocative methacholine mass corresponding to a 35% decrease in SGaw was 86 micrograms (range 2 to 157 micrograms) in asymptomatic subjects with asthma and 1361 micrograms (range 157 to 3434 micrograms) in normal subjects (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,E Donna;I Danta;C S Kim;A Wanner
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31420279/,Opening the Window of Immune Opportunity: Treating Childhood Asthma,"Asthma is an increasingly common childhood disease and although most patients can control their symptoms with medication, a proportion experience life-threatening symptoms. The advent of novel biologic therapies represents a giant leap forward for asthma treatment, but efficacy is rarely tested in children. Recent mechanistic work in mice suggests that early life is a key period for immune development and, therefore, allergen sensitization. Although children with severe asthma experience significant comorbidities and are at increased risk for serious diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as adults, no specific investigation into tailored treatment for young children with severe asthma exists. Here, we propose how new information regarding early life immunity could be used to inform modified treatments for children.",,Clare M Lloyd;Sejal Saglani

Treatment is complex, due to disease heterogeneity, comorbidities and complexity in care pathways. New approaches and treatments improve health outcomes for people with severe asthma. However, emerging multidimensional and targeted treatment strategies require a reorganisation of asthma care. Consensus is required on how reorganisation should occur and what areas require further research. The Centre of Excellence in Severe Asthma convened three forums between 2015 and 2018, hosting experts from Australia, New Zealand and the UK. The forums were complemented by a survey of clinicians involved in the management of people with severe asthma. We sought to: (i) identify areas of consensus among experts; (ii) define activities and resources required for the implementation of findings into practice; and (iii) identify specific priority areas for future research. Discussions identified areas of unmet need including assessment and diagnosis of severe asthma, models of care and treatment pathways, add-on treatment approaches and patient perspectives. We recommend development of education and training activities, clinical resources and standards of care documents, increased stakeholder engagement and public awareness campaigns and improved access to infrastructure and funding. Further, we propose specific future research to inform clinical decision-making and develop novel therapies.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19387036/,Asthma therapies revisited: what have we learned?,"Asthma is a heterogenous disorder related to numerous biologic, immunologic, and physiologic components that generate multiple clinical phenotypes. Further, genetic and environmental factors interact in ways that produce variability in both disease onset and severity and differential expression based on both the age and sex of the patient. Thus, the natural history of asthma is complex in terms of disease expression, remission, relapse, and progression. As such, therapy for asthma is complicated and has been approached from the standpoints of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. Presently, asthma cannot be cured but can be controlled in most patients, an indication that most of the success clinical research strategies have realized has been in the area of tertiary prevention. Since for many adult patients with asthma their disease had its roots in early life, much recent research has focused on events during early childhood that can be linked to subsequent asthma development with the hopes of creating appropriate interventions to alter its natural history of expression. These research approaches can be categorized into three questions. Who is the right patient to treat? When is the right time to begin treatment? And finally, what is the appropriate treatment to prescribe?",,Robert F Lemanske Jr
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26596632/,Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap: asthmatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or chronic obstructive asthma?,"Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are different disease entities. They are both clinical diagnoses, with diagnostic tools to discriminate between one another. However, especially in older patients (>55 years) it seems more difficult to differentiate between asthma and COPD. This has led to the definition of a new phenotype called asthma COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS). However, our understanding of ACOS is at a very preliminary stage, as most research has involved subjects with existing diagnoses of asthma or COPD from studies with different definitions for ACOS. This has led to different and sometimes opposing results between studies on several features of ACOS, also depending on the comparison with COPD alone, asthma alone or both, which are summarized in this review.We suggest not using the term ACOS for a patient with features of both asthma and COPD, but to describe a patient with chronic obstructive airway disease as completely as possible, with regard to characteristics that determine treatment response (e.g. eosinophilic inflammation) and prognosis (such as smoking status, exacerbation rate, fixed airflow limitation, hyperresponsiveness, comorbidities). This will provide a far more clinically relevant diagnosis, and would aid in research on treatment in more homogenous groups of patients with chronic airways obstruction. More research is certainly needed to develop more evidence-based definitions for this patient group and to evaluate biomarkers, which will help to further classify these patients, treat them more adequately and unravel the underlying pathophysiological mechanism.",asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome; phenotype.,Annelies Slats;Christian Taube
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12125917/,Allergic rhinitis and its impact on asthma: an evidence-based treatment strategy for allergic rhinitis,"The overall pathogenic view of respiratory allergy has deeply changed and evolved during the last ten years. Much emphasis has been laid to the relationship between rhinitis and asthma, which is between the upper and the lower respiratory airways. This strict link has been evidenced through clinical observations and epidemiological studies and also on the basis of immunological observations and outcomes of therapy. Furthermore, the frequent co-existence of rhinitis and asthma (up to 80 percent of asthmatic patients have co-existing allergic rhinitis, while up to 40 percent of allergic rhinitis patients have asthma, the coexistence of sinusitis and asthma, the presence of rhinitis as a risk factor for developing asthma, further emphasize this link and together lead to the operative definition of Allergic Rhinobronchitis or, United Airways Disease (UAD). The strict link existing between upper and lower respiratory tract can be also regarded from the viewpoint of therapeutical outcomes. The more detailed knowledge of the intricate mechanisms sustaining allergic inflammation in the respiratory tract (i.e. antigen presentation, cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules) has clarified the functional relationships between nose and lung. Thus allergic rhinitis or asthma is not a disease confined to a specific target organ, but rather a disorder of the whole respiratory tract, with a range of clinical manifestations, leading to relevant diagnostic and therapeutic implications as indicated in the WHO Initiative ARIA, the first evidence-based guideline emphasizing the impact of allergic rhinitis on asthma and where a step-wise treatment strategy targeting both the upper and lower airway effectively has been proposed. Moreover, the use of novel potential therapies that target both rhinitis and asthma like antileukotrienes or anti-IgE are indeed a future strategy.",,Ruby Pawankar
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10849139/,Asthma and dualism,"The rejection of Cartesian dualism can be taken to imply that the mind is implicated in health and illness to a greater degree than conventional medicine would suggest. Surprisingly, however, there appears to be a train of thought in antidualist nursing theory which takes the opposite view. This paper looks closely at an interesting example of antidualist thinking - an article in which Benner and her colleagues comment on the ways in which people with asthma make sense of their condition - and concludes that it places unduly stringent and arbitrary limits on the mind's role. It then asks how antidualism can lead to such a dogmatic rejection of the idea that states of the body are clinically influenced by states of mind. The answer to this question is that Benner assimilates very different philosophical theories into the same 'tradition'. On this occasion, she has combined Descartes, Kant and the Platonist ascetics into a single package, misleadingly labelled 'Cartesianism', and this move accounts for her unexpected views on the relation between mind and body in asthma.",,J Paley

With the prospect of acting on different pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease, the idea of precision medicine was developed, in which a single molecule is able to modify a specific triggering mechanism. Thus, it seemed limiting to stop at the distinction of patients phenotypes and the concept of endotypes became more relevant in the therapeutic approach.Areas covered: This review deepened the topic of precision medicine through the transition from phenotyping to endotyping. We performed a review of the literature, preferring articles quoted in Medline and published in journals with an impact factor. Results showed that it is fundamental to take into consideration the role of biomarkers and the related therapies currently available for precision medicine.Expert opinion: The possible overlap of patients in different phenotypes requires a more precise classification, which considers endotypization. With the development of biological drugs able to modify and modulate some pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease, the theoretical concept of endotyping becomes practical, allowing the clinician to choose the specific mechanism to 'attack' in order to control the disease.",Precision medicine; biological drugs; biomarkers; endotype; monoclonal antibodies; personalized medicine; phenotype; severe asthma.,Diego Bagnasco;Giovanni Passalacqua;Marco Caminati;Enrico Heffler;Francesco Menzella;Laura De Ferrari;Anna Maria Riccio;Chiara Folli;Giorgio Walter Canonica

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8494197/,Nocturnal asthma: circadian rhythms and therapeutic interventions,"The pathophysiology of nocturnal asthma is closely associated with chronobiology, the science of biologic processes that have time-related rhythms. The 24-h cycle (circadian rhythm) is especially important in understanding the changes in pulmonary function that occur in sleeping asthmatics. Nocturnal asthma can be seen as representing an exaggerated amplitude of normal circadian patterns, including increased airway responsiveness and decreased lung function at night and in the early morning. Circadian changes in epinephrine, AMP, histamine and other inflammatory mediators, cortisol, vagal tone, body temperature, and lower airway secretions are potential mechanisms that favor nocturnal bronchoconstriction. Circadian variation in pulmonary function, as well as the effect of therapeutic interventions, can be readily demonstrated by having patients record peak expiratory flow rate values at different times of the day and night, using a peak flow meter. The treatment of nocturnal asthma requires a chronopharmacologic approach, in which more intense therapy is targeted to coincide with the time that the disease is the worst. Chronopharmacology includes the strategic use of longer-acting beta-agonists, theophylline, corticosteroids, and anticholinergics. Understanding the kinetics of the different drug preparations is necessary for most effective timing of dose. Future treatment of nocturnal asthma will continue to be guided by increased understanding of circadian and sleep-related events.",,R J Martin

Incidence estimation, early information to the patient, identification of responsible workplaces were the main objectives of the programme. A network of 18 clinical centers (allergologists, chest physicians, occupational physicians) from whole the Piedmont region provides information on newly diagnosed cases to a surveillance center that receives and analyzes reports and disseminates surveillance results to clinicians and occupational health and safety services, responsible for intervention. Between 1 March 1996 and 31 December 1997 67 new cases were reported, which corresponds to an incidence rate of 24 (C.I. 95%: 18-30) per million workers per year. The incidence was higher among bakers (540 per million), among workers employed in the leather and shoe industry (214 per million), in health care services (205 per million), in the pharmaceutical industry (199 per million) and among hairdressers (196 per million). The agents to which workers were exposed at the time of diagnosis were generally well recognised (latex 51%; flour 27%). Procedures and results of the PRiOR programme are comparable with those from surveillance systems operating in other countries. Nevertheless, continued efforts are needed to increase the proportion of collaborating physicians, to standardize the use of tests for diagnosis and to improve the communication between clinical centers and occupational health and safety services. Like most surveillance systems based on similar methods, PRiOR underestimates the true incidence of work-related asthma in the Piedmont Region.

It is important to consider the possibility of comorbid conditions that aggravate, complicate or simulate the symptoms of the disease in the face of a patient with asthma and poor response to treatment. Among subjects with asthma, some conditions stand out as the most frequent: chronic rhinitis or rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, obesity, and cardiovascular disorders. Comorbidities reduce the chances of optimal asthma control. It is essential to assess and manage properly these complex situations, choosing wisely preventive strategies and treatment options to avoid adverse events and optimize outcomes. Medications for asthma have the potential to worsen cardiovascular conditions, while beta-adrenergic receptor blockers and angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibitors used for cardiovascular conditions, can worsen asthma. Handling properly these cases will save lives and resources. However, there are multiple gaps in knowledge requiring investigation in this field to inform integrated care pathways and policies. It is likely information may be obtained from real life studies and electronic medical databases. Communications between the providers and patients may be facilitated by electronic technology, opening a large window for guided self-management.",Asthma; Chronical diseases; Comorbidities; Management; Multimorbidities; Polypharmacy.,Luane Marques de Mello;Álvaro A Cruz
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26037949/,The role of the small airways in the pathophysiology of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), represent a major social and economic burden for worldwide health systems. During recent years, increasing attention has been directed to the role of small airways in respiratory diseases, and their exact contribution to the pathophysiology of asthma and COPD continues to be clarified. Indeed, it has been suggested that small airways play a distinct role in specific disease phenotypes. Besides providing information on small airways structure and diagnostic procedures, this review therefore aims to present updated and evidence-based findings on the role of small airways in the pathophysiology of asthma and COPD. Most of the available information derives from either pathological studies or review articles and there are few data on the natural history of small airways disease in the onset or progression of asthma and COPD. Comparisons between studies on the role of small airways are hard to draw because both asthma and COPD are highly heterogeneous conditions. Most studies have been performed in small population samples, and different techniques to characterize aspects of small airways function have been employed in order to assess inflammation and remodelling. Most methods of assessing small airways dysfunction have been largely confined to research purposes, but some data are encouraging, supporting the utilization of certain techniques into daily clinical practice, particularly for early-stage diseases, when subjects are often asymptomatic and routine pulmonary function tests may be within normal ranges. In this context further clinical trials and real-life feedback on large populations are desirable.",COPD; asthma; pathophysiology; phenotype; small airways.,Matteo Bonini;Omar S Usmani

We analyzed the relation between family history and these types of asthma using cross-sectional data from a school-based study of 5,046 Southern California children. Parental and/or sibling history of asthma and allergy were generally more strongly associated with early-onset persistent asthma compared with early-onset transient or late-onset asthma. For children with two asthmatic parents relative to those with none, the prevalence ratio for early-onset persistent asthma was 12.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 7.91-18.7] compared with 7.51 (95% CI = 2.62-21.5) for early-onset transient asthma and 5.38 (95% CI = 3.40-8.50) for late-onset asthma. Maternal smoking in pregnancy was predominantly related to the risk of early-onset persistent asthma in the presence of parental history of allergy and asthma, and the joint effects were more than additive (interaction contrast ratio = 3.10, 95% CI = 1.45-4.75). Our results confirm earlier data that parental history of asthma and allergy is most strongly associated with early-onset persistent asthma and suggest that among genetically predisposed children, an early-life environmental exposure, maternal smoking during pregnancy, favors the development of early-onset asthma that persists into later early childhood.",,S J London;W James Gauderman;E Avol;E B Rappaport;J M Peters

China released its first children's asthma action plan in 2017 to improve asthma control. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of the Chinese Children's Asthma Action Plan (CCAAP) in the management of children with asthma. Methods: Children with persistent asthma (6-14 years old) at 10 tertiary hospitals were randomized to receive either CCAAP instructions (intervention group, n = 87) or no plan (control group, n = 86) in addition to the usual asthma care, including education, stepwise asthma therapy, and regular outpatient follow-up. Children were followed up by using a serial measurement of outcomes over the course of 3 months. Results: CCAAP instructions did not have a significant effect on any of outcomes compared with the intervention group: (1) variables related to asthma exacerbation, including the number of patients (p = 0.09), symptomatic days (p = 0.658), severity, medication (courses of reliever, p = 0.696; combined rhinitis medication, p = 0.081; combined oral antibiotics, p = 0.852), missed work days (p = 0.538) or school days (p = 0.441), and economic costs (p = 0.898); (2) asthma control (p = 0.180); or (3) pulmonary function parameters during the follow-up period. Both groups showed significant improvement in asthma control (both p < 0.001) and pulmonary function (p < 0.017) from baseline to the 3-month follow-up.

However, based on the results of fragmentary but varied analyses, the study of this disease in relation to the working careers of asthmatic subjects underlines the importance of the repercussions at the very start of professional life (choice of profession, recruitement in a company). The study of absenteeism and inaptitude reveals to what degree these consequences are related to the seriousness of the disease and to the asthmatic person's social sphere.

The nomenclature has now better defined categories of OA caused by sensitizing agents and irritants, the latter best typified by the reactive airways dysfunction syndrome. Selecting the most appropriate diagnostic testing and management is driven by assessing whether a sensitizer is involved, and if so, identifying whether the sensitizing agent is a high-molecular-weight agent such as a protein or a low-molecular-weight reactive chemical such as an isocyanate. Increased understanding of the pathogenesis of OA from reactive chemical sensitizers is leading to development of better diagnostic testing and also an understanding of why testing for sensitization to such agents can be problematic. Risk factors for OA including possible genetic factors are being delineated better. Recently published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of occupational asthma are summarized; these reflect an increasingly robust evidence basis for recommendations. The utility of diagnostic tests for OA is being better defined by evidence, including sputum analysis performed in relation to work exposure with suspected sensitizers.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10212851/,Bacterial infection as an important triggering factor in bronchial asthma,"It is very surprising that in recent decades, the bacterial infection factor has been so overlooked in the causal treatment of bronchial asthma. Emphasis is put in the viral infection, but the bacterial infection usually associated with it is ignored. In several publications, we have insisted on the importance of the bacterial infection factor in the etiopathogenesis of bronchial asthma. It is alarming that even in the international consensus on its treatment this aspect is overlooked. In the first decades of this century, great importance had already been put on bacterial infection in the triggering of bronchospasm. In this review, we insist on this role of bacterial infection, which comes as a result of our extensive experience in this area, and the fact that in the last 10 years many authors have proven its responsibility at a bronchial mucosa level. In due time, we may be able to prove that the bacterial antigens can potentiate the action of inhalant allergens. Some authors have even proven that the action of these bacterial antigens even more energetically increases the number of intraepithelial dendritic cells in the bronchial mucosa after inhalation of bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Bystander respiratory bacterial infections can also directly modulate T helper 1 and 2 selection parallel to the immune response to inhalant allergens. Recent studies have also proven that in respiratory infection, bacterial antigens hold the main responsibility in the inflammatory and bronchospastic response in the etiopathogenesis of bronchial asthma. Therefore, a consequent treatment of the infection is required, by means of wide spectrum antibiotics, as well as prescription of bacterial immunotherapy, as we have emphasized on other occasions. In conclusion, we must try to cure asthmatic patients and not to maintain them with inhalers and unnecessary corticosteroid therapy, since increasing reactions to corticosteroids are witnessed every day.",,A K Oehling

Although the overriding consideration in the development of these parameters is to improve the level of care for patients, and by doing so to decrease asthma morbidity and mortality, recent guidelines have also emphasized cost factors, especially those that are now being developed by managed care organizations. Practice parameters can also reduce malpractice liability, and studies have even shown a reduction in hospital admissions by instituting relatively simple measures of patient behavior.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30666508/,Inner-City Asthma in Children,"Asthma in inner-city children is often severe and difficult to control.

Higher exposure to household pests, such as cockroaches and mice, pollutants and tobacco smoke exposure, poverty, material hardship, poor-quality housing, differences in health care quality, medication compliance, and heath care access also contribute to increased asthma morbidity in this population. Since 1991, the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases established research networks: the National Cooperative Inner-City Asthma Study (NCICAS), the Inner-City Asthma Study (ICAS), and the Inner-City Asthma Consortium (ICAC), to improve care for this at risk population. The most striking finding of the NCICAS is the link between asthma morbidity and the high incidence of allergen sensitization and exposure, particularly cockroach. The follow-up ICAS confirmed that reductions in household cockroach and dust mite were associated with reduction in the inner-city asthma morbidity. The ICAC studies have identified that omalizumab lowered fall inner-city asthma exacerbation rate; however, the relationship between inner-city asthma vs immune system dysfunction, respiratory tract infections, prenatal environment, and inner-city environment is still being investigated. Although challenging, certain interventions for inner-city asthma children have shown promising results. These interventions include family-based interventions such as partnering families with asthma-trained social workers, providing guidelines driven asthma care as well as assured access to controller medication, home-based interventions aim at elimination of indoor allergens and tobacco smoke exposure, school-based asthma programs, and computer/web-based asthma programs.",Asthma; Asthma Research Networks; Asthma morbidity; Asthma risk factors; Children; Inner-city; Severe asthma.,Pavadee Poowuttikul;Shweta Saini;Divya Seth

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8752496/,[Classification of bronchial asthma according to steroid and immunosuppressive treatment],"In long-term management of bronchial asthma, severity is classified according to the need for steroid treatment. In mild asthma, no chronic steroid treatment is needed; bronchodilators alone can relieve symptoms. In patients with moderate asthma, continuous inhaled steroids are necessary. In severe asthma, both oral and inhaled steroids are necessary. Patients resistant to steroids are included among those with severe asthma. Patients who need 10 mg or more of prednisolone per day to control their asthma are classified as steroid resistant. However, steroid resistance has also been defined in terms of the reversibility of the forced expiratory volume 1 second (FEV1) after 1 to 2 weeks of oral steroids. The mechanism of steroid resistance remains to be clarified; functional derangement and a reduction in the number of steroid receptors on lymphocytes have been postulated as mechanisms. Turner-Warwick classified asthmatics according to the way that peak flow is affected by therapy. In her classification, patients with ""brittle"" asthma are likely to be steroid resistant and those with ""irreversible"" asthma are likely to be steroid resistant and those with ""irreversible"" asthma are likely to be steroid dependent. This classification implies that response to steroid therapy may be predicted from measurements of peak expiratory flow. Therefore, although the response to steroid therapy may not be useful in classifying the pathogenesis of asthma, it is one of the most important ways to classify the severity of asthma.",,Y Nagasaka;S Nakajima

Forty-seven children with mild to moderate asthma were allocated to a FeNO group (n = 22) and to a control group (n = 25). In the FeNO group therapy was based on symptoms, beta-agonist use, lung function, and FeNO whereas in the control group therapy was based on symptoms, beta-agonist use and lung function only. Patients performed five visits in 6 weeks intervals. Frequency of respiratory symptoms, beta-agonist use, FEV(1)% predicted and the frequency of exacerbations were similar between groups. Patients in the FeNO group received higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (control group: median (interquartile range): 241 microg (26-607 microg); FeNo group: 316 microg (200-500 microg) and had significantly higher MEF(50)% predicted (control group: median (interquartile range): 68.5% (55.8-83.1%); FeNO group: 83.2% (62.9%-98.3%). At a cut-off point of 22.9 ppb FeNO the best predictive value for exacerbations with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 60% was found. Significant relationships were observed between FeNO and dose of ICS (beta = -8.77; P < 0.002), beta-agonist use 2 weeks prior to a visit (beta = 0.11; P < 0.05), asthma symptoms (beta = 0.02; P < 0.0001), and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (beta = 0.04; P = 0.02).

For predicting uncontrolled asthma, score cut-off points of 19 were used for C-ACT and ACT. According to GINA guidelines, asthma was uncontrolled in 71 (51%) children and completely controlled in 19 (14%) children. The area under the curve in the receiver operating characteristic curves for C-ACT and ACT versus GINA guidelines were 0.89 and 0.92, respectively. Cut-off points of 19 for C-ACT and ACT resulted in a sensitivity of 33% and 66% in predicting uncontrolled asthma, respectively.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12063511/,The natural history of asthma and early intervention,"The understanding of the natural history of asthma has changed significantly during the last 4 decades, with the view that asthma is a disease of chronic inflammation and varying degrees of severity replacing that of it being a disease of reversible airway obstruction. Treatment has progressed in accordance with the growing knowledge about the pathophysiologic mechanisms of asthma. Nevertheless, much remains unknown, especially about how to treat asthma effectively. Pharmacogenetics, an emerging field in which the knowledge of the genetic basis of a disease is applied to its treatment, may ultimately lead investigators to define many unanswered questions about asthma therapy. Asthma occurs early in childhood, but the ideal time for intervention and the most effective treatment strategy are yet unknown for young patients. The lack of response to a therapy may indicate the course of the disease as much as a lack of treatment efficacy. It may be that including such variables as airway hyperresponsiveness in treatment goals will not only become routine but will result in improved long-term asthma treatment as well. The progress in defining asthma and targeting treatment toward specific pathophysiologic mechanisms should lead to better-defined optimal strategies for treating asthma in children.",,Stanley J Szefler

In turn, acceptance of therapy guidelines essentially depends on both the structure and the presentation of the contents. GUIDELINES FOR THE TREATMENT OF ASTHMA were first issued in 1994 by the Deutsche Atemwegsliga. Since then, almost 4 years have passed, and our knowledge of the pathogenesis of asthma and drug efficacy has improved significantly. In addition, new classes of antiasthmatic drugs will be soon available. These developments make it necessary to adapt the guidelines to current knowledge.",,C Kroegel

A thorough clinical history is essential to the diagnosis of asthma. Additional tests are used only to confirm the clinical impression and to provide objective evidence supporting therapeutic recommendations. Multidisciplinary management includes an evaluation of psychosocial factors and patient information. Drugs should be selected according to the severity of the condition: beta-2-agonists for intermittent mild wheezing; cromolyn sodium for moderate to severe asthma; xanthines, ipratropium bromide, and oral corticosteroids in more persistent and severe forms. The child and parents should be told that a normal, physically active life is quite possible if the disease is correctly controlled.

Recent evidence has demonstrated that all these cells require calcium-dependent reactions for their activation, which suggests that mobilization of calcium from extracellular and intraorganelle storage depots to the cytoplasmic matrix may be one possible underlying mechanism for asthma. Numerous agents have been developed to prevent this flow of calcium to the intracellular cytoplasmic matrix. Although their exact mechanism of action is not always clear, it has been shown that they can be effective in preventing muscle spasm and release of chemical mediators from mast cells following antigen and exercise challenges. Studies indicate that one calcium channel blocking agent, ketitofen, is effective as a prophylactic agent in the treatment of mild to moderate asthma.

There is currently no unifying hypothesis to explain these trends or any associated risk factors. Environmental factors that may lead to asthma include air pollution; genetic factors, the hygiene hypothesis, and lifestyle differences also play potentially causative roles.

In fact, these episodes are highly prevalent even in patients with well-controlled disease. Published literature suggests that asthma worsenings likely represent a window of opportunity during which patients could intervene early to prevent exacerbations or further deterioration of asthma symptoms. However, current evidence suggests that most patients fail to respond or to self-manage appropriately during these periods.To address the issue of asthma worsenings, an interdisciplinary committee of respirologists, allergists, family physicians, pharmacists and certified asthma educators from across Canada developed a practical definition of asthma worsenings and provided approaches to the prevention and management of these episodes based on current literature. To date, combination inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta-agonist therapy, particularly single inhaler maintenance and reliever therapy, appears to be an effective strategy for preventing asthma worsenings and exacerbations. Addressing the potential barriers to appropriate patient self-management of asthma worsenings, such as failure to adequately identify and respond to worsenings, low expectations for controlling asthma, low health literacy and poor patient-health care professional communication, are also critical to the successful prevention and management of these episodes. Finally, an interdisciplinary team approach involving patients and their families, certified asthma educators, primary care physicians, pharmacists and specialists is likely to have the greatest impact on the identification, prevention and management of asthma worsenings.",,Meyer Balter;Pierre Ernst;Wade Watson;Harold Kim;Lisa Cicutto;Marie-France Beauchesne;Andrew J Cave;Alan Kaplan;Donna Hogg;Andrew McIvor;Tom Smiley;Michel Rouleau;J Mark FitzGerald;Asthma Worsenings Working Group

In both Toronto and Auckland, the number of emergency visits for asthma had increased significantly in the past decade (P less than .015 but the rate of rise was significantly higher in Auckland (P less than .05). In Auckland, 27% of asthmatics were admitted whereas in Toronto significantly fewer (16%) were admitted (P less than .0005). Objective measures of pulmonary function were documented more frequently by emergency room physicians in New Zealand than in Canada (90% versus 48%; P less than .0005). Pulmonary function measurement was primarily by peak flow meter in Auckland and most commonly by spirometer in Toronto so that pulmonary function measurements could not be compared directly between centers. In both centers, however, admitted patients had significantly lower pulmonary function indices than discharged patients. In New Zealand, mean peak flow was 38% of the predicted value among all asthmatics assessed; in Toronto, mean FEV1 was 47% of predicted.

Criteria for corticosteroid-dependent asthma and potentially fatal asthma have been described. We report six patients with potentially fatal asthma whose disease became even more life threatening because of psychological, psychosocial, environmental, financial issues, or a combination of these factors. Two of these patients died of asthma. The single common denominator is that owing to a variety of factors these patients are noncompliant with medications, office visits, telephone instructions, or other points of management. Thus the term ""malignant"" in the context used in this report is to emphasize to patients and physicians that the asthma is unmanageable, not because of the asthma as a disease itself, but because the noncompliance of the patient makes the disease malignant. Patient education and confrontation regarding noncompliance did not reduce major asthma episodes. The patients place themselves at higher risk of death from asthma by not letting the physician help control their asthma. This poses a great dilemma to the physician, who must have the patients' health as the highest priority.

To determine whether nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) influences airway smooth muscle in response to exogenous stimuli, we examined the effect of NCPAP on aerosolized methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction in 16 stable asthmatic patients. The dose-response curve for each subject was measured by a log transformation and linear regression analysis as well as a formula fitted to the data points to obtain values for a (slope) and b (position). The PD20FEV1 significantly increased in patients receiving 8 cmH2O of NCPAP by one doubling dose compared with that in patients using sham pressure. NCPAP shifted the dose-response curves to be flatter, deviated upwards and to the right. The coefficient a, indicating bronchial reactivity, was significantly lower in patients receiving NCPAP. The coefficient b, indicating the bronchial sensitive threshold, was higher after applying NCPAP. In contrast, coefficients a and b did not change in subjects with sham pressure. NCPAP also significantly enhanced the bronchodilator effect of inhaled salbutamol in response to methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction. In summary, we have shown that NCPAP therapy improves bronchial smooth reactivity with an increase in PD20FEV1 and a reduction in the bronchial reactivity and bronchial sensitivity. Therefore, NCPAP may provide an adjuvant therapy in patients with acute bronchial asthma.",,H C Lin;C H Wang;C T Yang;T J Huang;C T Yu;W B Shieh;H P Kuo

Efforts to overcome barriers to treatment caused by noncompliance are critical to successful care. This report reviews five patients with malignant potentially fatal asthma in remission, in whom noncompliance played the major role in preventing control of asthma. Through patient confrontation and the monitoring of serum concentrations of prednisone and its metabolite prednisolone, noncompliance may be addressed. Psychiatric referral may also be of benefit, if accepted by the patient and family. Use of injectable methylprednisolone may be a necessary alternative to prevent life-threatening complications of asthma. In all patients, keeping medical regimens as simple as possible is advocated, with the use of the lowest doses of medication necessary to maintain the control of symptoms, and the prevention of morbidity and mortality.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20816181/,Environmental epigenetics of asthma: an update,"Asthma, a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airway, is influenced by interplay between genetic and environmental factors now known to be mediated by epigenetics. Aberrant DNA methylation, altered histone modifications, specific microRNA expression, and other chromatin alterations orchestrate a complex early-life reprogramming of immune T-cell response, dendritic cell function, macrophage activation, and a breach of airway epithelial barrier that dictates asthma risk and severity in later life. Adult-onset asthma is under analogous regulation. The sharp increase in asthma prevalence over the past 2 or 3 decades and the large variations among populations of similar racial/ethnic background but different environmental exposures favors a strong contribution of environmental factors. This review addresses the fundamental question of whether environmental influences on asthma risk, severity, and steroid resistance are partly due to differential epigenetic modulations. Current knowledge on the epigenetic effects of tobacco smoke, microbial allergens, oxidants, airborne particulate matter, diesel exhaust particles, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dietary methyl donors and other nutritional factors, and dust mites is discussed. Exciting findings have been generated by rapid technological advances and well-designed experimental and population studies.

Although federally sponsored national surveys provide estimates of asthma prevalence, these surveys are not designed to characterize the burden of asthma by self-reported disease activity. We sought to characterize asthma burden in the United States. This study was based on a cross-sectional random-digit-dial household telephone survey designed to identify adult patients and parents of children with current asthma. Global asthma burden was comprised of three components: short-term symptom burden (4-week recall), long-term symptom burden (past year), and functional impact (activity limitation). Using this construct, only 10.7% of individuals were classified as having a global asthma burden consistent with mild intermittent disease, and 77.3% had moderate to severe persistent disease. These results suggest that a majority of the United States population with asthma experiences persistent rather than intermittent asthma burden. In addition, the discordance in type and distribution of asthma symptoms reported by individual subjects suggests that the exact estimate of the burden of asthma is related to how the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program classification is operationalized. Inquiry into recent day or nighttime symptoms alone underestimates the burden of asthma and may lead to inadequate treatment of asthma based on national guideline recommendations.",,Anne L Fuhlbrigge;Robert J Adams;Theresa W Guilbert;Evie Grant;Paula Lozano;Susan L Janson;Fernando Martinez;Kevin B Weiss;Scott T Weiss

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26430184/,Drug therapies in severe asthma - the era of stratified medicine,"Difficult-to-treat asthma affects up to 20% of patients with asthma and is associated with significant healthcare cost. It is an umbrella term that defines a heterogeneous clinical problem including incorrect diagnosis, comorbid conditions and treatment non-adherence; when these are effectively addressed, good symptom control is frequently achieved. However, in 3-5% of adults with difficult-to-treat asthma, the problem is severe disease that is unresponsive to currently available treatments. Current treatment guidelines advise the 'stepwise' increase of corticosteroids, but it is now recognised that many aspects of asthma are not corticosteroid responsive, and that this 'one size fits all' approach does not deliver clinical benefit in many patients and can also lead to side effects. The future of management of severe asthma will involve optimisation with currently available treatments, particularly corticosteroids, including addressing non-adherence and defining an 'optimised' corticosteroid dose, allied with the use of 'add-on' target-specific novel treatments.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34246434/,Prevention and Treatment of Asthma Exacerbations in Adults,"Asthma exacerbations are major contributors to disease morbidity in patients of all ages. To develop strategies that reduce the disease burden from exacerbations, it is helpful to review current concepts about the risk factors for asthma attacks and current approaches for prevention and treatment. Multiple factors contribute as risks and to the development of asthma exacerbations, including allergic and infectious processes. Viral respiratory infections, primarily from rhinoviruses, are the dominant exacerbating cause for most asthma patients. Allergic sensitization and allergen exposure contribute directly and enhance susceptibility for respiratory viral infections. Respiratory viruses infect airway epithelium to promote underlying type 2 inflammation with eosinophils, the predominant cellular component of increased inflammation. Deficiencies of antiviral interferon responses and generation have been identified that increase susceptibility to viral infections in asthma. Exacerbation treatment focuses on reducing airflow obstruction and suppressing inflammation, followed by improving long-term asthma control. Increasing concern exists regarding the side effects associated with frequent systemic corticosteroid use. A major advance has been the selective use of biologics to prevent exacerbations, primarily in patients with existing type 2 inflammation. Future research to prevent exacerbations is being directed toward antiviral activity and a more encompassing regulation of underlying airway inflammation.",Allergy; Asthma; Exacerbations; Rhinovirus; Type 2 inflammation.,Andrew Menzies-Gow;William W Busse;Mario Castro;David J Jackson

A number of definitions have emerged to characterize the clinical features of severe asthma, but a central feature of this phenotype is the need for high doses of medications, especially corticosteroids, in attempts to achieve disease control. The prevalence of severe asthma is also undergoing reevaluation from the usual estimate of 10% to larger numbers on the basis of medication needs and the lack of disease control achieved. At present, the underlying mechanisms of severe asthma are not established but likely reflect a heterogeneous pattern, rather than a single unifying process. Guideline-directed treatment for severe asthma has limits with usual approaches centered on high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting β-agonists, and trials with omalizumab, the monoclonal antibody to IgE. With the development of approaches to recognize asthma phenotypes with distinct pathogenesis and hence unique therapeutic targets, it is hoped that a personalized strategy in treatment directed toward disease-specific features will improve outcomes for this high-risk, severely affected population of patients.",Asthma; anti-IgE; bronchodilators; corticosteroids; immunomodulators.,Matthew C Bell;William W Busse

First, obese patients are at increased risk of asthma or asthma‑like symptoms. Second, asthma accompanied by obesity is more severe and more difficult to treat. A specific phenotype called obesity‑associated asthma has been also described, which is late‑onset, rather severe, non-type 2‑driven disease, present mostly in women. In addition, obesity can coincide with asthma also in children, and, although obesity generally skews the Th1/Th2 balance towards Th1, it can also accompany type 2‑driven asthma.

To address this problem, we measured TLC (TLC-XR) from posteroanterior and lateral chest roentgenograms obtained during exacerbations (E) of asthma and after recovery (R) using planimetry in 12 asthmatic subjects. At recovery, TLC was also measured by plethysmography or by helium dilution for comparison with the radiographic measurement. The plethysmographic measurements were made with a panting frequency less than 1 Hz to allow for airway obstruction. A chest radiologist also used independent radiologic measurements of hyperinflation (lung height, diaphragmatic arc height, rib counts) to assess lung volumes. Mean FEV1 during E was 1.43 +/- 0.38 L, and significant improvement occurred at R (FEV1 = 2.81 +/- 0.58 L, p less than 0.05). Of the independent radiologic variables measured, only an increase in lung height distinguished the two sets of radiographs. Mean TLC-XR (E) (6.01 +/- 1.62 L) was significantly greater than mean TLC-XR (R) (5.44 +/- 1.17 L, p less than 0.05). TLC measured radiographically at recovery was strongly correlated (r = 0.94) with TLC measured by plethysmography or helium dilution.
