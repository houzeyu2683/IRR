https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3771850/,Spotting sinister spots. A challenge to dermatologists to examine every new patient at increased risk for signs of early melanoma,"Preventing death from malignant melanoma is the most pressing issue in preventive dermatology in the United States because the mortality rate has increased markedly. Dermatologists, as the physicians best suited by training to identify early malignant melanoma, need to take the lead in developing a national project of educating physicians, patients, and the public to recognize the clinical features of early malignant melanoma and to appreciate that prompt excision results in a high rate of cure. The immediate challenge is to commit ourselves to examining every new patient and to conducting periodic ""skin scans"" of every patient at increased risk for melanoma. Just as the Papanicolaou screening test has markedly reduced cervical cancer mortality rates, commitment to early identification and excision of melanomas can mean a comparable triumph for preventive dermatology and will help us meet the challenge of our Australian colleagues to make melanoma a word, not a death sentence.",,J B Howell,melanoma

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28859850/,"IL-4/5 signalling plays an important role during Litomosoides sigmodontis infection, influencing both immune system regulation and tissue pathology in the thoracic cavity","Approximately 100 million people suffer from filarial diseases including lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis), onchocerciasis (river blindness) and loiasis. These diseases are amongst the most devastating of the neglected tropical diseases in terms of social and economic impact. Moreover, many infection-induced immune mechanisms in the host, their relationship to disease-related symptoms and the development of pathology within the site of infection remain unclear. To improve on current drug therapies or vaccines, further studies are necessary to decipher the mechanisms behind filaria-driven immune responses and pathology development, and thus the rodent model of Litomosoides sigmodontis can be used to unravel host-filaria interactions. Interestingly, BALB/c mice develop a patent state (release of microfilariae, the transmission life-stage, into the periphery) when exposed to L. sigmodontis. Thus, using this model, we determined levels of host inflammation and pathology development during a L. sigmodontis infection in vivo for the first known time. Our study reveals that after 30days p.i., inflammation and pathology began to develop in infected wild type BALB/c mice between the lung and diaphragm, close to the site of infection - the thoracic cavity. Interestingly, infected IL-4Rα/IL-5-/- BALB/c mice had accentuated inflammation of the pleural lung and pleural diaphragm, and higher parasite burdens. Corresponding to the pleural inflammation, levels of IP-10, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MIP-2 and RANTES were significantly elevated in the thoracic cavity fluid of infected IL-4Rα/IL-5-/- mice compared with wild type controls. Moreover, upon L. sigmodontis antigen stimulation, IFN-γ and IL-17A secretions by cells isolated from draining lymph nodes of IL-4Rα/IL-5-/- mice were significantly elevated, whereas secretion of IL-5, IL-13 and IL-10 was reduced. Elevated filaria-specific IFN-γ secretion was also observed in spleen-derived CD4+ T cell co-cultures from IL-4Rα/IL-5-/- mice. In summary, this study unravels the essential role of IL-4/IL-5 signalling in controlling immunity against filarial infections and demonstrates the requirement of this pathway for the host to control ensuing pathology and inflammation.",Diaphragm; IL-4Rα/IL-5(−/−); Immune regulation; Litomosoides sigmodontis; Lung; Pathology; Thoracic cavity.,Manuel Ritter;Ruth S Tamadaho;Judith Feid;Wenzel Vogel;Katharina Wiszniewsky;Sven Perner;Achim Hoerauf;Laura E Layland,chest
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28218741/,Identification of microRNAs associated with invasive and aggressive phenotype in cutaneous melanoma by next-generation sequencing,"A comprehensive repertoire of human microRNAs (miRNAs) that could be involved in early melanoma invasion into the dermis remains unknown. To this end, we sequenced small RNAs (18-30 nucleotides) isolated from an annotated series of invasive melanomas (average invasive depth, 2.0 mm), common melanocytic nevi, and matched normal skin (n=28). Our previously established bioinformatics pipeline identified 765 distinct mature known miRNAs and defined a set of top 40 list that clearly segregated melanomas into thin (0.75 mm) and thick (2.7 mm) groups. Among the top, miR-21-5p, let-7b-5p, let-7a-5p, miR-424-5p, miR-423-5p, miR-21-3p, miR-199b-5p, miR-182-5p, and miR-205-5p were differentially expressed between thin and thick melanomas. In a validation cohort (n=167), measured expression of miR-21-5p and miR-424-5p, not previously reported in melanoma, were significantly increased in invasive compared with in situ melanomas (P<0.0001). Increased miR-21-5p levels were significantly associated with invasive depth (P=0.038), tumor mitotic index (P=0.038), lymphovascular invasion (P=0.0036), and AJCC stage (P=0.038). In contrast, let-7b levels were significantly decreased in invasive and in situ melanomas compared with common and dysplastic nevi (P<0.0001). Decreased let-7b levels were significantly associated with invasive depth (P=0.011), Clark's level (P=0.013), ulceration (P=0.0043), and AJCC stage (P=0.011). These results define a distinct set of miRNAs associated with invasive and aggressive melanoma phenotype.",,Sankhiros Babapoor;Rong Wu;James Kozubek;Donna Auidi;Jane M Grant-Kels;Soheil S Dadras,melanoma
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33575241/,Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 Detection With Nasopharyngeal Swabs,"Background: SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects have been proven contagious in the symptomatic, pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic phase. The identification of these patients is crucial in order to prevent virus circulation. No reliable data on the sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are available because of the lack of a shared reference standard to identify SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The aim of our study was to collect data on patients with a known diagnosis of COVID-19 who underwent serial testing to assess NPS sensitivity. Methods: The study was a multi-center, observational, retrospective clinical study with consecutive enrollment. We enrolled patients who met all of the following inclusion criteria: clinical recovery, documented SARS-CoV-2 infection (≥1 positive rRT-PCR result) and ≥1 positive NPS among the first two follow-up swabs. A positive NPS not preceded by a negative nasopharyngeal swab collected 24-48 h earlier was considered a true positive. A negative NPS followed by a positive NPS collected 24-48 h later was regarded as a false negative. The primary outcome was to define sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection with NPS. Results: Three hundred and ninety three NPS were evaluated in 233 patients; the sensitivity was 77% (95% CI, 73 to 81%). Sensitivity of the first follow-up NPS (n = 233) was 79% (95% CI, 73 to 84%) with no significant variations over time. We found no statistically significant differences in the sensitivity of the first follow-up NPS according to time since symptom onset, age, sex, number of comorbidities, and onset symptoms. Conclusions: NPS utility in the diagnostic algorithm of COVID-19 should be reconsidered.",COVID-19; diagnosis; false negative (FN); sensitivity; swab analysis.,Bianca Clerici;Antonio Muscatello;Francesca Bai;Donatella Pavanello;Michela Orlandi;Giulia C Marchetti;Valeria Castelli;Giovanni Casazza;Giorgio Costantino;Gian Marco Podda,covid-19

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33649778/,Current molecular and clinical insights into uveal melanoma (Review),"Uveal melanoma (UM) represents the most prominent primary eye cancer in adults. With an incidence of approximately 5 cases per million individuals annually in the United States, UM could be considered a relatively rare cancer. The 90‑95% of UM cases arise from the choroid. Diagnosis is based mainly on a clinical examination and ancillary tests, with ocular ultrasonography being of greatest value. Differential diagnosis can prove challenging in the case of indeterminate choroidal lesions and, sometimes, monitoring for documented growth may be the proper approach. Fine needle aspiration biopsy tends to be performed with a prognostic purpose, often in combination with radiotherapy. Gene expression profiling has allowed for the grading of UMs into two classes, which feature different metastatic risks. Patients with UM require a specialized multidisciplinary management. Primary tumor treatment can be either enucleation or globe preserving. Usually, enucleation is reserved for larger tumors, while radiotherapy is preferred for small/medium melanomas. The prognosis is unfavorable due to the high mortality rate and high tendency to metastasize. Following the development of metastatic disease, the mortality rate increases to 80% within one year, due to both the absence of an effective treatment and the aggressiveness of the condition. Novel molecular studies have allowed for a better understanding of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms involved in UM biological activity, which differs compared to skin melanomas. The most commonly mutated genes are GNAQ, GNA11 and BAP1. Research in this field could help to identify effective diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as novel therapeutic targets.",uveal melanoma; staging; treatment; diagnosis; prognosis; biomarkers; epigenetics.,Matteo Fallico;Giuseppina Raciti;Antonio Longo;Michele Reibaldi;Vincenza Bonfiglio;Andrea Russo;Rosario Caltabiano;Giuseppe Gattuso;Luca Falzone;Teresio Avitabile,melanoma
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33318230/,Central Diabetes Insipidus in a Preterm Neonate Unresponsive to Intranasal Desmopressin,"Central or neurogenic diabetes insipidus (DI) is uncommon in the pediatric age group and rarely occurs in neonates. It should be suspected in any neonate presenting with excessive urine output and hypernatremia that persists despite increased fluid administration. Diabetes insipidus may be secondary to asphyxia, intraventricular hemorrhage, infection, and structural abnormalities or may be idiopathic or genetic. Diagnosis includes a careful history, laboratory testing, and magnetic resonance imaging. Management of neonatal DI involves a careful balance between fluid intake and pharmacologic treatment. In this article we report a case of an extremely low birth weight infant presenting with central DI possibly caused by abnormality of the pituitary gland. Persistent hypernatremia was the initial presentation. Increased fluids were given initially but were only partially helpful. Eventually subcutaneous desmopressin (DDAVP) was required. The infant was unresponsive to intranasal DDAVP and required subcutaneous DDAVP upon discharge.",DDAVP; central diabetes insipidus; cranial diabetes insipidus; desmopressin; hypernatremia; vasopressin.,Abrar Hussain;R John Baier;Ayman Abou Mehrem;Hanifi Soylu;Debbie Fraser;Yasser Elsayed,diabetes

Blood pressure (BP) levels, treatment and control status and medical follow-up were assessed. Subjects were classified as either known hypertensives or newly identified hypertensives. There was a moderate increase in blood pressure control over the two-year period in known hypertensives. Approximately half of newly identified hypertensives remained untreated, uncontrolled; half became ex-hypertensives. One third of the ex-hypertensives, however, still had high-normal diastolic readings (85-89 mm Hg). Newly identified hypertensives reported less frequent medical visits and fewer non-pharmacological recommendations from their physicians than known hypertensives.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1687447/,Hypertension in African Americans: evaluation and treatment issues,"The evaluation and treatment of hypertension in the African-American patient with an elevated blood pressure presents a diagnostic challenge. We are less able to rely on young age and resistance to treatment as indications for more extensive evaluation of secondary causes of hypertension; thus, greater reliance on history, physical examination, and clinical judgment is required if we are to identify potentially treatable causes. The treatment of hypertension in the African-American patient also presents a therapeutic challenge. Thiazide diuretics remain the drugs of first choice for treating hypertension in the African-American hypertensive. The calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are attractive alternatives to thiazides in patients uncontrolled by or intolerant of thiazides or who have specific indications for these agents (eg, angina, severe diastolic dysfunction). Beta-blockers should not be denied to African-American hypertensives if indications for their use exist. Although beta-blockers may be less effective as monotherapy, 50% of African-American hypertensives can be so controlled. Resistance to beta-blockers may be eliminated by administering them with a diuretic. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), like CCBs, are well tolerated, but also lack long-term primary prevention data. As is the case with beta-blockers, ACEIs are less effective in African-American hypertensives when used as monotherapy. ACEIs have particular value in therapy for African-American hypertensives with concomitant congestive heart failure and may protect against progression of diabetic nephropathy. Finally, all hypertensives, especially African-American hypertensives, should have access to treatment prior to the development of end organ damage. The cost of early intervention is minimal compared with the economic consequences of neglect.",,S H Kailani;J T Wright Jr,hypertension

Chitosomes were prepared by directly hydrating the thin lipid film using chitosan solution as hydration medium, instead of using it as a coating agent. Developed chitosomes demonstrated spherical morphology, positive surface charge (~30 mV) and ~60% encapsulation efficiency. The calorimetric studies and X-ray diffraction pattern of Met-loaded chitosomes confirmed the successful encapsulation of Met inside the chitosome vesicles. Optimized chitosome formulation showed ~70% drug release in 72 h, displaying prolonged and controlled release of drug. Results demonstrated that Met encapsulated chitosomes possessed enhanced cellular internalization and improved cytotoxic potential. Our findings also supported inhibitory activity of chitosomes against metastatic property of pleural mesothelioma cells. The in-vitro tumor simulation studies further established anti-tumor activity of Met encapsulated chitosomes as supported by reduction in tumor volume and presence of minimal viable cells in tumor mass.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2664010/,Differential expression of ras oncogene products among the types of human melanomas and melanocytic nevi,"Ras oncogene expression of malignant melanoma and melanocytic nevus have been immunohistochemically analyzed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues from 26 melanomas and 24 melanocytic nevi with a monoclonal antibody that was generated against Harvey sarcoma virus-derived ras oncogene products (p21ras). We found distinct differences of p21ras expressions by the type of melanoma. Nodular melanoma, epithelioid cell type melanoma, and deeply invading melanoma revealed higher reactivity with anti-p21ras monoclonal antibody than the other types. The reactivity of melanomas appeared to correlate with the degree of malignancy of the melanoma. It was also demonstrated, however, that part of melanocytic nevi reacted with anti-p21ras monoclonal antibody with a relatively strong intensity. Melanocytic nevi with junctional activity and nevus cells located in the epidermis in compound nevi did not show the positive reaction in contrast to dermally located nevus cells that had relatively strong reactivity. The different p21ras expression among the type of tumors may represent the state of tumor cells differentiation with greater expression with more immaturity in the melanocyte lineage. p21ras expression does not appear to represent a marker of malignant transformation.",,H Yasuda;H Kobayashi;A Ohkawara;N Kuzumaki,melanoma

Impedance cardiography, which assesses cardiac function by measuring the opposition to an alternating electric current in the thorax, indicates the amount of fluid in the thorax. It is used externally by employing electrodes on the thorax but can also be used internally by electrodes within a cardiac pacemaker. Recent studies have suggested that one of its direct measurements, thoracic impedance, may identify patients at risk for decompensation of heart failure, but because these measurements inconsistently correlate with pulmonary artery catheter measurements and study sample sizes are small, further research is required before its use can be recommended.",,Lynn Folan;Marjorie Funk,chest

Herein, we describe a case of a patient infected with human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) who was falsely diagnosed with COVID-19 using the Ampdirect™ 2019-nCoV detection kit (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) and SARS-CoV-2 Detection Kit (TOYOBO co., ltd.), and was admitted to a COVID-19 hospital ward. We suspected a cross-reaction between HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2; however, the reported genome sequences of HCoV-NL63 and N1/N2 primers for SARS-CoV-2 do not correspond. Thus, the PCR result was supposed to be a false positive possibly due to contamination or human error. Although the issue of a false-negative result has been the focus of much attention to prevent the spread of the disease, a false positive is fraught with problems as well. Physicians should recognize that unnecessary isolation violates human rights and a careful diagnosis is indispensable when the results of laboratory testing for COVID-19 are unclear. Generally, in cases such as a duplicate PCR test was partially positive, either N1 or N2 alone was positive, PCR testing for two or more target regions resulted in a positive only for single region, a high cycle threshold >35 was obtained, a false positive should be suspected. Especially, when these conditions coincide, we should recognize the high likelihood of a false positive.",Coronavirus disease 2019; Human coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.,Yuki Otsuka;Hideharu Hagiya;Yasuhiro Nakano;Daisuke Omura;Kou Hasegawa;Haruto Yamada;Koji Iio;Tomoyuki Honda;Fumio Otsuka,covid-19

Three separate groups of patients with mediastinal adenopathy were identified. Patients with disease limited to the mediastinum had a favorable prognosis, and treatment with mantle followed by para-aortic irradiation has resulted in 85% relapse-free survival and 100% overall survival at 8 years. Surgically staged patients with large diameter mediastinal adenopathy (greater than 0.33 of the thoracic diameter) have a high relapse rate with radiation therapy alone. The use of combined modality therapy has reduced the risk of relapse in these patients, but the survival remains higher whether MOPP is used initially or at relapse.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14724537/,[Molecular markers associated to prognosis of melanoma],"Melanoma prognosis is based on histological criteria such as tumor thickness (measured by Breslow index), level of invasion (Clarck's level), presence of ulceration and number of mitoses per mm2. However, these parameters do not provide a precise prognosis in all cases: thin melanomas may develop metastases and thick melanomas may remain focalized for many years. For these reasons, the search for other prognostic factors is still ongoing. Many molecules play a part in the invasiveness and metastatic dissemination of melanoma have now been identified. Expression of these molecules has been studied in primary melanoma and correlated with prognosis. An increase in the number of cells positive for Ki67 (detected by Mib1), cycline A, cycline D, p35, MMp-2, beta1 and beta3 integrins, osteonectin, the presence of an intense inflammatory infiltrate and capillary invasion are considered as factors of poor prognosis as well as the decrease in p16, p27, Melan A and nm23. The significance of CD44 modifications is still controversial. Only a small number of these different proteins has a prognostic value independent of tumor thickness.

Although the increasing incidence of melanoma is currently attributable to ""thin"" lesions, the incidence rates of ""thick"" melanomas have not declined. We want to identify the clinical and demographic characteristics of patients that are associated with diagnosis of thick (> 3 mm) cutaneous melanoma and whether they had changed from mid-1980s to late-1990s. Cutaneous malignant melanomas incidence in 1985-87 and in 1995-97 were retrieved from the Tuscany Cancer Registry, central Italy. Only cases with Breslow-thickness information (182/260 in 1985-87 and 387/490 in 1995-97) were included. Thickness was categorised in < = 1 mm, 1-3 mm and > 3 mm. Thickness was evaluated for each period of time according to gender, age, histological type, site and residence. For cases diagnosed in 1995-97 the effect of such variables in predicting the risk of a thick tumour (vs. a thin one) was analysed in a logistic model. In 1985-87 patients with thick melanoma were more likely to be - with a statistically significant difference - males (38.1 % of thick tumours) than females (19.4 %), over 70 (57.7 % of thick tumour), with nodular melanoma (62.1 %) and residents far from the city of Florence (30.3 %); no differences were evidenced according to site. From 1985-87 to 1995-97 there was a global shift towards thinner melanomas. In 1995-97 nodular type and old age were the only variables significantly associated with thick melanomas when other factors were taken into account in a multivariate analysis.

Melanomas are classified into two types: melanotic and amelanotic. Prior research suggests that human amelanotic melanomas are more aggressive than their melanotic counterparts. This study evaluates the behavior of canine melanotic and amelanotic oral cavity melanomas and quantifies cell proliferation and the expression of connexins. Twenty-five melanomas (16 melanotic and 9 amelanotic) were collected from dogs during clinical procedures at the Veterinary Hospital of the School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science of the University of São Paulo, Brazil. After diagnosis, dogs were followed until death or euthanasia. Histopathology confirmed the gross melanotic or amelanotic characteristics and tumors were classified according to the WHO. HMB45 or Melan A immunostainings were performed to confirm the diagnosis of amelanotic melanomas. Cell proliferation was quantified both by counting mitotic figures and PCNA positive nuclei. Expressions of connexins 26 and 43 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR and Western blot. Dogs bearing amelanotic melanomas presented a shorter lifespan in comparison to those with melanotic melanomas. Cell proliferation was significantly higher in amelanotic melanomas. Expressions of Connexins 26 and 43 were significantly reduced in amelanotic melanomas. The results presented here suggest that oral cavity melanotic and amelanotic melanomas differ regarding their behavior, cell proliferation and connexin expression in dogs, indicating a higher aggressiveness of amelanotic variants.",,Tarso Felipe Teixeira;Luciana Boffoni Gentile;Tereza Cristina da Silva;Gregory Mennecier;Lucas Martins Chaible;Bruno Cogliati;Marco Antonio Leon Roman;Marco Antonio Gioso;Maria Lucia Zaidan Dagli,melanoma

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12431131/,"Diabetes insipidus in children: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management","In diabetes insipidus, the amount of water ingested and the quantity and concentration of urine produced needs to be carefully regulated if fluid volume and osmolality are to be maintained within the normal range. One of the principal mechanisms controlling urine output is vasopressin which is released from the posterior pituitary gland and enhances water reabsorption from the renal collecting duct. In diabetes insipidus, the excessive production of dilute urine, and the causes of this clinical picture can be divided into three main groups: the first is primary polydipsia where the amount of fluid ingested is inappropriately large; the second group is cranial diabetes insipidus where the production of vasopressin is abnormally low; and, the third group is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus where the kidney response to vasopressin is impaired. The history and examination may suggest an underlying explanation for diabetes insipidus but a range of baseline and more extensive investigations may be required before a diagnosis can be reached. These investigations are not without risk, and the results need to be interpreted carefully because children do not always segregate neatly into a particular diagnostic category on the basis of one test alone. Children with cranial diabetes insipidus typically respond to arginine vasopressin or its manufactured analogue, desmopressin, with an increase in urine osmolality and an associated reduction in urine output. Such children usually require neuroimaging to look for evidence of evolving CNS pathology, such as an intracranial tumour. Vasopressin ""replacement"" with desmopressin is the treatment of choice in patients with cranial diabetes insipidus although extreme caution is required when treating babies or small children because of the danger of fluid overload. Abnormal production of other pituitary hormones in children with CNS disease can also influence fluid balance. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be due to abnormal electrolyte concentrations, therefore these should be measured as part of the initial assessment. In a small number of children the defect is a primary abnormality of the vasopressin receptor or one of the water channel proteins (aquaporins) involved in water transport. The treatment of these patients is difficult and typically involves therapy with a diuretic such as chlorothiazide, as well as indomethacin. These agents enhance urine osmolality by their effect on circulating volume and renal solute and water handling. The fluid intake of most young children with primary polydipsia can be safely reduced to a more appropriate level.",,Tim Cheetham;Peter H Baylis,diabetes

For this reason, the extent and consequence of patient and professional delay in diagnosis and treatment was investigated in 233 patients with histologically proven primary cutaneous melanomas seen at the Department of Dermatology and Allergology at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany, between January 1999 and January 2001. Personal interviews were conducted by two physicians to obtain information on patients' knowledge of melanoma symptoms, sun behaviour, delay in seeking medical attention, professional delay and related factors. The main component of delay was patient related. Nearly one-third (29.2%) of all patients reported a delay interval of more than 12 months from the onset of an observed change in a pigmented lesion or first detection of a pigmented lesion to the first visit to a physician. The delay interval from the first visit to a physician to surgical treatment was shorter (< 1 month) in most of our patients (74.7%). The predominant symptoms of melanoma detected by patients were a change in colour and an increase in size or elevation. Most patients had obtained knowledge about cutaneous melanomas from television and magazines. A delay in diagnosis and a history of many sunburns and outdoor leisure time activities were not associated with a greater tumour thickness. However, fairer skin types, lower education levels and lack of knowledge about cutaneous melanoma were associated with a greater tumour thickness. Further efforts are necessary to improve public and medical education about early detection and prompt surgical treatment, which is known to be the most effective treatment modality for cutaneous melanomas.",,M H Schmid-Wendtner;J Baumert;J Stange;M Volkenandt,melanoma

In a race to contain the infection, researchers and healthcare officials have developed several assays to help diagnose individuals with COVID-19. To help laboratories decide what assay to bring into testing lines, factors such as assay availability, cost, throughput, and TAT should be considered. Here we validated a modified version of the CDC assay and used it as a reference to evaluate the performance of the NeuMoDxTM SARS-CoV-2 and DiaSorin SimplexaTM Covid-19 Direct assays. In silico analysis and clinical sample testing showed that the primers/probes designed by the CDC were specific to the SARS-CoV-2 as they accurately detected all reactive samples with an assay LoD of 200 copies/mL. The performance of the three assays were analyzed using 159 nasopharyngeal swabs specimen tested within 1-5 days after routine testing. A 100 % agreement was observed between the commercial assays and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. A deeper look at the Ct values showed no significant difference between NeuMoDx and the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay, whereas DiaSorin had lower overall Ct values than the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay. NeuMoDx and DiaSorin workflows were much easier to perform. NeuMoDx has the highest throughput and shortest TAT, whereas although the modified CDC SARS-CoV-2 assay has comparable throughput to DiaSorin, it has the longest hands-on time and highest TAT.",COVID-19; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2.,Amorce Lima;Vicki Healer;Elaine Vendrone;Suzane Silbert,covid-19
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3059645/,Carotid artery wall properties in normotensive and borderline hypertensive subjects of various ages,"The vessel wall properties of the common carotid artery were studied noninvasively in normotensive and borderline hypertensive male volunteers of various ages with the use of a multi-gate pulsed Doppler system. In the younger age group (20-35 y) both distensibility and cross-sectional compliance were significantly less in the borderline hypertensive group. In the older borderline hypertensive subjects (50-69 y) distensibility (p less than 0.05) and cross-sectional compliance (p = 0.06) were also less than in the control subjects. The reduced distensibility and cross-sectional compliance likely result from a decrease in arterial wall elasticity because the relative increase in common carotid artery diameter during systole is diminished in borderline hypertensives, despite the fact that their pulse pressure is similar to or higher than that in control subjects. The less pronounced differences in vessel wall properties between borderline hypertensive and normotensive volunteers in the older age group may be a consequence of the changes in these properties with age, partly masking the alterations due to borderline hypertension. Since the stiffer behavior of the common carotid artery in borderline hypertensives is associated with relatively slight changes in blood pressure, the question can be raised whether the alterations in arterial wall properties are really a result of the elevated arterial blood pressure; these alterations might develop independent of the blood pressure elevation.",,T Van Merode;P J Hick;A P Hoeks;K H Rahn;R S Reneman,hypertension

Diagnostic tests for covid-19 fall into two main categories: molecular tests that detect viral RNA, and serological tests that detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a molecular test, has become the gold standard for diagnosis of covid-19; however, this test has many limitations that include potential false negative results, changes in diagnostic accuracy over the disease course, and precarious availability of test materials. Serological tests have generated substantial interest as an alternative or complement to RT-PCR and other Nucleic acid tests in the diagnosis of acute infection, as some might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of care. A clear advantage of these tests over RT-PCR is that they can identify individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, even if they never underwent testing while acutely ill. Many serological tests for covid-19 have become available in a short period, including some marketed for use as rapid, point-of-care tests.

In order to determine the duration of infectivity and its correlation with reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) results and time since initial positive PCR test in this population, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 cell infectivity in nasopharyngeal samples longitudinally obtained from asymptomatic carriers who disembarked from a cruise ship during a COVID-19 outbreak. Of 166 nasopharyngeal samples collected from 39 asymptomatic carriers every 48 h until two consecutive negative PCR test results were obtained, SARS-CoV-2 was successfully isolated from 9 PCR-positive samples which were obtained from 7 persons (18%; 7/39). Viable viruses were isolated predominantly within 7 days after the initial positive PCR test, except for one person who shed viable virus until day 15. The median crossing point (Cp) value of RT-PCR of culture-positive samples was 24.6 (interquartile range [IQR], 20.4 to 25.8; range, 17.9 to 30.3), and Cp values were significantly associated with isolation of viable virus (odds ratio, 0.496; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.329 to 0.747; P value, 0.001), which was consistent with existing data for symptomatic patients. Genome sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 samples consecutively obtained from a person who shed viable virus for 15 days identified the emergence of two novel single nucleotide variants (C8626T transition and C18452T transition) in the sample collected on day 15, with the latter corresponding to an amino acid substitution in nonstructural protein 14. The impact of these mutations on prolonged viable-virus shedding is unclear. These findings underscore the potential role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission.IMPORTANCE A growing number of studies suggest the potential role of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers as a major driver of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, virological assessment of asymptomatic infection has largely been limited to reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), which can be persistently positive without necessarily indicating the presence of viable virus (e.g., replication-competent virus). Here, we evaluated the infectivity of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers by detecting SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effects on Vero cells using longitudinally obtained nasopharyngeal samples from asymptomatic carriers. We show that asymptomatic carriers can shed viable virus until 7 days after the initial positive PCR test, with one outlier shedding until day 15. The crossing point (Cp) value of RT-PCR was the leading predictive factor for virus viability. These findings provide additional insights into the role of asymptomatic carriers as a source of transmission and highlight the importance of universal source control measures, along with isolation policy for asymptomatic carriers.",COVID-19; COVID-19 nucleic acid testing; SARS-CoV-2; asymptomatic infections; carrier state; cell culture techniques; cytopathogenic effect; infectivity; virus shedding; whole-genome sequencing.,Takayuki Murata;Aki Sakurai;Masahiro Suzuki;Satoshi Komoto;Tomihiko Ide;Takuma Ishihara;Yohei Doi,covid-19

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9411584/,[Arterial hypertension and exercise],"Both dynamic and static exercise increase blood pressure in normotensive and hypertensive patients, but the change varies among these two main forms of exercise. The validity of the blood pressure response to acute exercise as a predictor for the future development of hypertension in normotensives, or of the degree of target organ damage in hypertensives is still not clear. This acute response could be an independent predictor of mortality or cardiovascular events in the normotensives. The postexercise hypotension could work as a beneficial mechanism to reduce the reduce the rise in pressure that occurs with time. While epidemiological studies suggest an inverse relationship between physical activity or fitness and blood pressure, longitudinal studies seem to confirm the hypotensive effect of dynamic aerobic training. Though possibly in a lesser degree, strength training has also been proved to be effective. Among the responsible mechanisms, a decrease in sympathetic nerve activity is most likely involved. Hypertension seems to be also associated with a lower maximal capacity, that could be even more adversely affected by the action of certain antihypertensive drugs such as diuretics or beta-blockers. All of these aspects have led to the acceptance of physical exercise among the non-pharmacological measures for the treatment of hypertension.",,L Serratosa Fernández;A Fernández Vaquero,hypertension

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33130151/,End-point RT-PCR: A potential alternative for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is considered the ""gold standard"" for the direct diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, routine diagnosis by RT-qPCR is a limitation for many laboratories, mainly due to the infrastructure and/or disproportionate relationship between demand and supply of inputs. In this context, and to increase the diagnostic coverage of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we describe an alternative, sensitive and specific one-step end-point RT-PCR for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene. The performance of the RT-PCR was evaluated in 43 clinical samples, of which 10 and 33 were previously identified as negative and positive, respectively, by RT-qPCR. Among the positive samples, 15 and 18 were from asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, respectively. Here, 32/33 of the positive samples in the RT-qPCR, including from asymptomatic individuals, were found positive in the RT-PCR (Ct 15.94-34.92). The analytical sensitivity of the assay was about 7.15-9 copies of vRNA/μL, and nonspecific amplifications were not observed in SARS-CoV-2 negative samples. Importantly, the RT-PCR reactions were performed in a 10 μL final volume. Finally, considering specificity, analytical sensitivity and cost reduction, we believe that the RT-PCR platform described here may be a viable option for the diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infections in laboratories in which RT-qPCR is not available.",COVID-19; E gene; Molecular diagnosis; RT-PCR; SARS-CoV-2.,José Valter Joaquim Silva Júnior;Ingryd Merchioratto;Pablo Sebastian Britto de Oliveira;Thaísa Regina Rocha Lopes;Patrícia Chaves Brites;Elehu Moura de Oliveira;Rudi Weiblen;Eduardo Furtado Flores,covid-19

We conducted a case-control study in Samsun, Turkey, to examine the association between ACE genotype, ACE serum activity, and blood pressure. Serum ACE activity was measured and ACE I/D polymorphism performed in 165 hypertensive and 143 normotensive subjects. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR primers were flanking the polymorphic region in intron 16 of the ACE gene. The distribution of the DD, ID, and II ACE genotypes was 65, 77, and 23 in hypertensive patients and 42, 82, and 19 in normotensive subjects (P > .05). The estimated frequency of the insertion allele was 0.37 in hypertensive and 0.42 in normotensive subjects. Nevertheless, sensitivity analysis, based on positive family history and severity of hypertension, suggested that significant associations existed between more homogeneous groups of hypertensives and normotensives (P < .05). ACE genotype influenced ACE activity and the highest level was in DD genotype, being the lowest in II genotype.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8896306/,Automated blood pressure measurement (ABPM) in the elderly,"Application and feasibility of automated ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) in the elderly are comparable to younger age groups. Major side-effects are sleep disturbances and pain during cuff-inflation. The main indications for ABPM are diagnosis and control of treatment in hypertensive patients. Further indications are the diagnosis of syncope or hypotensive disorders and the diagnostic work-up of symptoms like vertigo, dizziness and dyspnea. In hypertensives, ABPM can easily assess the ""white coat"" effect and cases of ""white coat"" hypertension (prevalence in the elderly 15-25%). The prognostic implications of ""white coat"" hypertensions remain to be determined. Recording of the total 24-h blood pressure profile with analysis of circadian blood pressure changes, the day-night difference and the early morning surge raises the possibility to assess age-specific patterns. The drop in blood pressure at night (during sleep) is usually decreased and less frequently observed in elderly hypertensives. Possible explanations include decreased daytime activity, an altered sleep pattern in the elderly and secondary forms of hypertension. So-called ""non-dippers"", with no adequate drop in night-time blood pressure, show a significant increase in cardiovascular complications. Control of treatment via ABPM can assess non-responders and cases of overtreatment, and permits a fairly objective analysis of side-effects. Episodes of transient myocardial ischemia and possible trigger mechanisms can be assessed by simultaneous application of ABPM and Holter monitoring. The insufficient control of hypertension in the majority of elderly patients and the current lower target blood pressures in the elderly call for new methods to improve the level and quality of antihypertensive treatment.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8538921/,Urinary and plasma endothelin 1 in essential hypertension and in hypertension secondary to renoparenchymal disease,"An alteration in renal metabolism of endothelin may contribute to hypertension in the SHR and it has been shown that the excretion rate of endothelin is reduced in patients with essential hypertension. We measured plasma and urinary endothelin 1 (ET-1) in 20 untreated essential hypertensives with normal renal function, in eight normotensive healthy subjects, and in 13 hypertensive patients with primary renoparenchymal disease. Plasma ET-1 was higher (P < 0.01) in essential hypertensives (median 1.69, interquartile range 1.2-3.3 pg/ml) than in normal subjects (0.84, 0.37-1.10 pg/ml) but significantly less (P < 0.01) than in hypertensives with renoparenchymal disease (3.57, 1.45-9.52 pg/ml). ET-1 levels slightly correlated with diastolic pressure in essential hypertensives (r = 0.43, P < 0.05) and tended to be correlated with systolic pressure in hypertensives with renal disease (r = 0.47, P = 0.08). ET-1 excretion in essential hypertensives (137, 99-154 ng/24 h) and in normal subjects (120, 62-150 ng/24 h) was significantly lower than in renal hypertensives (191, 123-241 ng/24 h). The ET clearance/GFR ratio (ClET/GFR) was markedly reduced (30%, 21-67%) in essential hypertensives and substantially raised in renal hypertensives (164%, 86-314%) in comparison with normal subjects (83%, 35-94%). Since the ClET/GFR ratio should be 100% if all filtered ET-1 is excreted, the data indicate that ET-1 is synthesized at a reduced rate and/or broken down at an enhanced rate by the kidney in essential hypertension and confirm that there is a high ET-1 generation rate in remnant nephrons in hypertension secondary to renal disease.",,C Zoccali;D Leonardis;S Parlongo;F Mallamaci;M Postorino,hypertension

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34272205/,The evolution of rapid antigen detection systems and their application for COVID-19 and other serious respiratory infectious diseases,"Making the correct diagnosis of a patient seeking medical attention is the ultimate goal of a practicing physician, irrespective of whether the cause of the patient's condition is infectious or non-infectious. Antigen detection tests can be used to aid in the diagnosis of various infectious-related disorders including COVID-19 where it has become especially important due to the serious nature of this disease and its worldwide prevalence. These tests closely mimic one of the earliest prototypes - the urine pregnancy test - and as a result they have gained wide acceptance based on their overall simplicity, low cost and relative accuracy. In some situations, especially as a screening test, they can be used instead of the more technically demanding and complex molecular and serologic assays that are still useful and helpful under many different circumstances. Antigen detection systems are based on finding a particular immunogenic component, typically a protein or polysaccharide molecule, that is both unique and an integral part of the pathogen or other biological entity. Because these tests generally provide only qualitative results, they often need to be supplemented with other and sometimes more sophisticated laboratory-based diagnostic procedures to corroborate the initial test result. In this review, we first describe general background information on antigen-detection methods, including any unique aspects of their overall design, and then follow with an extensive description on the merits and limitations of these tests for detecting COVID-19 and, to a lesser extent, for other serious respiratory diseases caused by three common bacterial pathogens - Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila.",Antigen-detection; COVID-19; Legionella pneumophila; SARS-Cov-2; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Streptococcus pyogenes.,Charles S Pavia;Maria M Plummer,covid-19

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21444835/,Clinical features of 8295 patients with resistant hypertension classified on the basis of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring,"We aimed to estimate the prevalence of resistant hypertension through both office and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in a large cohort of treated hypertensive patients from the Spanish Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring Registry. In addition, we also compared clinical features of patients with true or white-coat-resistant hypertension. In December 2009, we identified 68 045 treated patients with complete information for this analysis. Among them, 8295 (12.2% of the database) had resistant hypertension (office blood pressure ≥140 and/or 90 mm Hg while being treated with ≥3 antihypertensive drugs, 1 of them being a diuretic). After ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, 62.5% of patients were classified as true resistant hypertensives, the remaining 37.5% having white-coat resistance. The former group was younger, more frequently men, with a longer duration of hypertension and a worse cardiovascular risk profile. The group included larger proportions of smokers, diabetics, target organ damage (including left ventricular hypertrophy, impaired renal function, and microalbuminuria), and documented cardiovascular disease. Moreover, true resistant hypertensives exhibited in a greater proportion a riser pattern (22% versus 18%; P<0.001). In conclusion, this study first reports the prevalence of resistant hypertension in a large cohort of patients in usual daily practice. Resistant hypertension is present in 12% of the treated hypertensive population, but among them more than one third have normal ambulatory blood pressure. A worse risk profile is associated with true resistant hypertension, but this association is weak, thus making it necessary to assess ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for a correct diagnosis and management.",,Alejandro de la Sierra;Julián Segura;José R Banegas;Manuel Gorostidi;Juan J de la Cruz;Pedro Armario;Anna Oliveras;Luis M Ruilope,hypertension

Fourteen laboratories from 7 European countries tested a panel of 23 MAbs for immunohistological staining reactivity for malignant and non-malignant lesions involving the melanocytic lineage. A standardized immunoperoxidase procedure was used and the results were evaluated using a standard protocol and data evaluation form developed in collaboration with the EORTC Data Center. According to this analysis, the antibodies in the panel could be classified into 3 main groups. The first group of MAbs includes those antibodies which stained the majority (greater than 80%) of all primary tumors, irrespective of their Breslow thickness and the majority of metastatic lesions. In addition, these MAbs stained a high percentage of cells within a given lesion. Several antibodies of Group I were likewise reactive with the majority of naevoblasts and with normal melanocytes. The second group of MAbs included antibodies reacting only with a limited number of primary melanomas and metastatic lesions. Antibodies of Group II reacted only weakly, if at all, with normal melanocytes or naevocytes. The percentage of cells within a malignant lesion stained by these MAbs was always rather low. The MAb group III detected surface structures whose expression appeared to be related to tumor progression; they did not react or reacted only weakly with naevi, and they all reacted with a small number of early primary melanomas (less than 0.75 mm). The number of lesions stained increased with increasing Breslow thickness. Our study suggests that the application of a panel of well defined MAbs might be of diagnostic and prognostic value in evaluating malignant melanoma.",,S Carrel;J F Doré;D J Ruiter;M Prade;F J Lejeune;U R Kleeberg;P Rümke;E B Bröcker,melanoma

The main primary brain insult was severe head injury in 12, anoxic ischemic brain damage in four, encephalitis in two, Reye's syndrome in one. Sixteen children died, and three survived. The time from insult to onset of polyuria varied from several hours to one month, and was significantly shorter in head trauma patients, 1.8 +/- 0.9 vs. 9.3 +/- 1.9 days for patients with anoxic ischemic brain damage (p less than 0.03). Twelve of the 19 patients met the criteria for brain death at onset of DI. Treatment by appropriate fluids and vasopressin resulted in resolution of polyuria and increase in urine osmolality. Ten patients developed DI while being treated with dopamine for hemodynamic support. In two of these patients, the cessation of dopamine was time-related to the resolution of DI. Our results indicate that as many as 15% of children with DI (with 95% confidence) following severe brain injury may survive.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30192302/,Melanoma diagnosis: predictive value of macroscopic changes observed by the patient,"About half of the melanomas are detected by patients but the mean thickness of such melanomas is higher than when diagnosed by physicians. Symptoms and signs described by patients are dynamic changes and pruritus, the appearance of a new lesion having been rarely investigated. These observations are documented for melanomas but not for benign naevi. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which both melanomas and suspected excised naevi were included. The main objectives were to (a) analyse the value of the anamnestic predictors for melanoma versus non-melanoma and (b) calculate the influence of age on the most significant anamnestic predictors. In order to reach these objectives, we prospectively collected data on symptoms (pruritus, anxiety) and signs (de novo appearance, dynamic changes and bleeding) described by patients undergoing the excision of lesions clinically diagnosed as melanocytic and considered as suspicious by 46 Belgian dermatologists. Among 1865 lesions, dynamic changes and de novo appearance were significant predictors for melanoma versus non-melanoma diagnosis in all patients and patients older than 50, respectively. More precisely, dynamic changes and de novo appearance occurred to be strong predictors for melanoma diagnosis in patients greater than 41.5 and greater than 44.5 years, respectively. Pruritus was not significant for melanoma diagnosis. As a conclusion, when mid-age or older patients observe melanocytic lesions as recently changed or newly appeared, such lesions should be considered more carefully than when observed by young patients.",,Isabelle Tromme;Laurine Sacré;Fatima Hammouch;Pauline Richez;Jean-Marie Degryse;Niko Speybroeck,melanoma

Malignant melanomas develop from melanocytes, which are derived from the neural crest. Neural crest cells express the embryonic muscarinic system during migration. Using the monoclonal antibody M35, we now show that normal melanocytes carry no muscarinic receptors, whereas malignant melanoma cells express them again. In primary melanomas and metastatic melanomas, we identified muscarinic receptors in solid strands or groups of atypical cells. In all primary malignant melanomas studied we found inhomogeneous distributions of M35-immunoreactivity subdividing the tumors into three different zones. In the tumor center, groups or single cells often showed only little or even no immunofluorescence. In contrast, pericentrally we detected strong immunostaining in the conglomerations of atypical melanocytes. In the peripheral infiltration zone, intensely fluorescent cells in clusters or single, were spreading into the normal tissue, leading to a more patchy staining pattern. Melanocytes of nevi also possess muscarinic receptors, showing similar distribution patterns as in the melanoma.

Contact tracing and surveillance are important to locate cases in the community, including asymptomatic individuals. Diagnosis of COVID-19 depends on the detection of viral RNA, viral antigen, or indirectly, viral antibodies. Molecular diagnosis, using real time, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the common standard method; however, it is not widely available in Indonesia and requires a high standard laboratory. Rapid, point-of-care antibody testing has been widely used as an alternative; however, interpretation of the results is not simple and now it is no longer used by the Indonesian government as a screening test for people travelling between locations. Thus, the rapid antigen detection test (Ag-RDT) is used by the Indonesian government as a screening test for travellers. As a result, many people buy the kit online and perform self-Ag-RDT at home. This raises the question of how safe and accurate it is to perform self-Ag-RDT at home. Before a test is applied, it is suggested to research its sensitivity and specificity, as compared to gold standard, and its limitations. In this article, laboratory diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is discussed, with an emphasis on Ag-RDT and the recommendation to use it properly in daily practice.",COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; antigen testing.,Tonny Loho;Djoko Widodo,covid-19
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31404607/,Unraveling the crosstalk between melanoma and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment,"Cutaneous melanoma is the most common skin cancer with an incidence that has been rapidly increasing in the past decades. Melanomas are among the most immunogenic tumors and, as such, have the greatest potential to respond favorably to immunotherapy. However, like many cancers, melanomas acquire various suppressive mechanisms, which generally act in concert, to escape innate and adaptive immune detection and destruction. Intense research into the cellular and molecular events associated with melanomagenesis, which ultimately lead to immune suppression, has resulted in the discovery of new therapeutic targets and synergistic combinations of immunotherapy, targeted therapy and chemotherapy. Tremendous effort to determine efficacy of single and combination therapies in pre-clinical and clinical phase I-III trials has led to FDA-approval of several immunotherapeutic agents that could potentially be beneficial for aggressive, highly refractory, advanced and metastatic melanomas. The increasing availability of approved combination therapies for melanoma and more rapid assessment of patient tumors has increased the feasibility of personalized treatment to overcome patient and tumor heterogeneity and to achieve greater clinical benefit. Here, we review the evolution of the immune system during melanomagenesis, mechanisms exploited by melanoma to suppress anti-tumor immunity and methods that have been developed to restore immunity. We emphasize that an effective therapeutic strategy will require coordinate activation of tumor-specific immunity as well as increased recognition and accessibility of melanoma cells in primary tumors and distal metastases. This review integrates available knowledge on melanoma-specific immunity, molecular signaling pathways and molecular targeting strategies that could be utilized to envision therapeutics with broader application and greater efficacy for early stage and advanced metastatic melanoma.",Checkpoint inhibition; Cutaneous melanoma; Cytokine therapy; DC; Immune escape; Immunotherapy; Innate and adaptive immunity; MDSC; Metabolites; Metastasis; NK; Suppression; T cells; Treg; Tumor microenvironment; Vaccination; microRNA.,Monica Marzagalli;Nancy D Ebelt;Edwin R Manuel,melanoma

Prevalence and control of hypertension","In recent years there has been a marked improvement in the level of hypertension control nationally in both blacks and whites. Information is still lacking, however, on the level of hypertension control in Mexican Americans. The authors carried out a cardiovascular risk factor survey on a random sample of Mexican Americans living in two low income census tracts in Laredo, Texas. The percentages of hypertensive women who had been previously diagnosed, were under treatment, and were ""under control"" compared favorably with national figures for blacks and whites. Corresponding percentages for men indicated that their level of diagnosis, treatment and ""control"" still lagged behind the national figures. The prevalence of hypertension in Laredo Project participants was intermediate between those observed in national studies for blacks and whites. This finding did not clearly emerge when comparisons were based on either blood pressure distributions or prevalence of elevated diastolic pressures. These results indicate that, because of the increasing number of ""controlled"" hypertensives in the population, comparisons between populations and across time can no longer be based exclusively on blood pressure measurements, but must include cases of ""controlled"" hypertension.",,M P Stern;S P Gaskill;C R Allen Jr;V Garza;J L Gonzales;R H Waldrop,hypertension

The management of postoperative polyuria and polydipsia can be challenging and fluid balance needs to be closely monitored. The classical triphasic pattern of endogenous vasopressin secretion--an initial phase of symptomatic diabetes insipidus occurring 24 hours after surgery; a second phase of inappropriate vasopressin secretion potentially causing hyponatraemia; and a third phase with a return to diabetes insipidus occurring up to 2 weeks later--is often complicated by cerebral salt wasting and thirst disorders. Inadequate adrenal replacement therapy and anticonvulsant agent treatment may increase the risk of life-threatening hyponatraemia in the course of desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment.

We assessed the surplus value of performing the SN procedure in melanoma patients who underwent regional nodal surgery. The SN procedure was performed in 348 patients with melanomas who were referred to our institute between 1993 and 1999. The localisations of the melanomas with the corresponding SNs were meticulously recorded on drawings of the human body and grouped according to the conventional descriptions. Predictability of lymph drainage was defined as the percentage of melanomas whose draining pattern was to the ipsilateral nearest basin, without simultaneous drainage to other basins or to an interval node. In all patients the SN procedure visualised at least one SN. We found 410 lymphatic basins in 347 patients. These basins included basins that could not have been predicted by the conventional clinical descriptions, such as multiple basins and contralateral drainage sites. For the head/neck region, SNs could be found in any of the basins described in the literature. The trunk's drainage predictability depended strongly on the melanoma localisation, ranging from 0% in the midline to 92% in one of the upper quadrants. The lower extremities had a high predictability of almost 100%, and predictability of drainage for the upper extremities ranged from 77% to 100%. In total, 34% of the patients had a cutaneous lymphatic drainage that was unpredictable, either totally or partially.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33622845/,Interpreting COVID-19 Test Results in Clinical Settings: It Depends!,"Tests for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are intended for a disparate and shifting range of purposes: (1) diagnosing patients who present with symptoms to inform individual treatment decisions; (2) organizational uses such as ""cohorting"" potentially infected patients and staff to protect others; and (3) contact tracing, surveillance, and other public health purposes. Often lost when testing is encouraged is that testing does not by itself confer health benefits. Rather, testing is useful to the extent it forms a critical link to subsequent medical or public health interventions. Such interventions might be individual level, like better diagnosis, treatment, isolation, or quarantine of contacts. They might aid surveillance to understand levels and trends of disease within a defined population that enables informed decisions to implement or relax social distancing measures. In this article, we describe the range of available COVID-19 tests; their accuracy and timing considerations; and the specific clinical, organizational, and public health considerations that warrant different testing strategies. Three representative clinical scenarios illustrate the importance of appropriate test use and interpretation. The reason a patient seeks testing is often a strong indicator of the pretest probability of infection, and thus how to interpret test results. In addition, the level of population spread of the virus and the timing of testing play critical roles in the positive or negative predictive value of the test.

Intracellular Mg2+ measurements were performed in lymphocytes of 18 untreated normotensive and 19 untreated essential hypertensive patients. Mg2+ content was referred to lymphocytic protein, which was determined according to Bradford's method. Mg2+ measurements were performed by atomic absorption spectroscopy using a Video 12 apparatus from Thermo Electron Instrumentation Laboratory, Andover, MA, USA. The results show that in patients with essential hypertension, total intralymphocytic Mg2+ content is significantly lower (0.07 +/- 0.05 mmol/g lymphocytic protein, mean +/- s.d.) as compared to controls (0.11 +/- 0.04 mmol/g lymphocytic protein, mean +/- s.d., P < 0.05). Free intracellular Mg2+ content was measured in lymphocytes by the fluorescent indicator mag-fura-II, showing no significant difference in normotensives and hypertensives (0.30 +/- 0.16 vs 0.38 +/- 0.17 mmol/l). In platelets free intracellular Mg2+ concentrations were not found of significant difference in normotensive and hypertensive patients (0.52 +/- 0.23 vs 0.47 +/- 0.27 mmol/l) using mag-fura-II. In plasma Mg2+ concentrations there was no significant difference in the normotensive and hypertensive group (0.92 +/- 0.07 vs 0.88 to 0.07 mmol/l). There was no correlation between plasma, free or total cellular magnesium concentrations in each group. Furthermore this method also seems suitable for routine measurements of total intracellular Mg2+ concentrations in even larger groups of patients in comparison with fluorescent indicator measurements like mag-fura-II. Lowered total intracellular Mg2+ concentrations in a subgroup of primary hypertension may contribute to the development of this disorder, perhaps due to different buffering systems.",,K Kisters;M Tepel;C Spieker;K H Dietl;M Barenbrock;K H Rahn;W Zidek,hypertension
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22579793/,Use of a molecular approach for the definitive diagnosis of proliferative larval mesocestoidiasis in a cat,"A 9 year-old male, neutered cat with a history of a sudden onset of lethargy, anorexia and respiratory distress was presented in a veterinary practice in Lucca, Italy. A clinical examination revealed that the cat was severely dehydrated, and had pale mucous membranes and tachypnoea. No pain or discomfort was detected at the time of physical examination. The cat was administered fluids, antibiotics and supportive therapy, but died overnight. The owner of the cat requested for a post mortem examination to be conducted. At necropsy, acephalic structures, consistent with proliferative tapeworm (cestode) larvae, were detected in the thoracic cavity on pleural surfaces. As these larvae could not be identified to genus or species by microscopy, a PCR-based sequencing-phylogenetic approach was used. Part of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene was PCR-amplified from genomic DNAs from five individual larvae and sequenced; all five sequences obtained were identical. This consensus sequence was aligned (over 355 nucleotide positions) with homologous sequences representing a range of cestodes (including Echinococcus granulosus, Echinococcus multilocularis, Hymenolepis microstoma, Mesocestoides spp. and Taenia saginata) from previously published studies and then subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The sequence representing the larval cestode from the affected cat grouped, with strong statistical support, with those representing Mesocestoides corti and Mesocestoides lineatus. Therefore, a definitive diagnosis of pleural proliferative larval mesocestoidiasis could be made.

The pleural drainage system requires effective drainage, suction, and water-sealing. Another key point of chest tube management is that a water seal is considered to be superior to suction for most air leaks. Nowadays, the most common pleural drainage device attached to the chest tube is the three-bottle system. An electronic chest drainage system has been developed that is effective in standardizing the postoperative management of chest tubes. More liberal use of digital drainage devices in the postoperative management of the pleural space is warranted. The removal of chest tubes is a common procedure occurring almost daily in hospitals throughout the world. Extraction of the tube is usually done at the end of full inspiration or at the end of full expiration.

Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, a known consequence of hypertension, is associated with an excess mortality independent of other known cardiovascular risk factors. Recently, LV hypertrophy accompanying hypertension has been associated with ominous ventricular arrhythmias. However, it does not necessarily follow that regression of LV hypertrophy will reduce this increased mortality. Diastolic dysfunction, manifested by reduced ventricular distensibility of the hypertrophying left ventricle, appears to be an early characteristic of the hypertensive heart since echocardiographic techniques have demonstrated diastolic filling abnormalities in untreated essential hypertensives even before significant LV hypertrophy appears. Not all antihypertensive agents diminish LV mass and improve diastolic dysfunction. Certain sympatholytic agents, calcium antagonists, beta-adrenergic blockers, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors appear to diminish LV hypertrophy. However, future studies are needed to determine if these agents that appear to reverse findings of LV hypertrophy and improve diastolic dysfunction will also reduce risk of coronary artery disease and related events.",,D J DiPette;E D Frohlich,hypertension

When prone and upright renograms were compared, 24% of the hypertensives demonstrated bilateral orthostatic renal dysfunction. Exercise caused the hippurate transport disturbance to increase.

Some of the metabolic, endocrinologic, adrenergic, and hemodynamic changes associated with this condition are reversed, in part, by weight reduction, which coincidentally decreases blood pressure (BP) in obese hypertensive patients. However, a major problem for obese hypertensives is dietary noncompliance. Consequently, a pharmacologic approach to obesity-related hypertension that meets the specific requirements of this complex pathological condition should be recommended when the initial nonpharmacological approach falls. Diuretics and beta-adrenergic blocking agents have been shown to be effective in decreasing BP in obese hypertensives, but they also decrease insulin sensitivity and increase cholesterol and lipoprotein concentrations.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34004465/,Diagnosis by forensic autopsy of cannula malposition resulting in fatal tension pneumothorax after attempted percutaneous tracheostomy: A short communication,"Percutaneous tracheostomy is commonly performed in the emergency department or intensive care unit to secure the airways of patients. This procedure is associated with a low incidence of complications; however, some of them, such as iatrogenic pneumothorax, can be fatal. Pneumothorax after percutaneous tracheostomy is most often caused by perforation of the tracheal wall or malposition of the cannula. A woman in her 80s was referred to the emergency department owing to persistent and prolonged coughing. Having speculated that she had acute epiglottitis, and having failed to achieve oral tracheal intubation, the physician performed a percutaneous tracheostomy to secure her airway. However, progressive percutaneous emphysema developed immediately thereafter, and the patient died shortly. Postmortem computed tomography showed bilateral pneumothorax. Forensic autopsy revealed that the tracheostomy cannula had failed to reach the trachea and was erroneously inserted into the right thoracic cavity via peritracheal route. Thus, it was determined that the patient's death was attributable to tension pneumothorax caused by cannula malposition during attempted tracheostomy.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29753503/,Novel esophageal reconstruction technique via transmediastinal route from posterior to anterior mediastinum after esophagectomy,"Background: The incidence of metachronous esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) after head and neck cancer (HNC) and in elderly patients has increased. Both elderly ESCC patients and ESCC patients after HNC surgery are at potential risk for dysphagia, and for the latter, surgery in the neck is difficult. An intrathoracic anastomosis that bypasses the cervical procedure is preferable to preserve swallowing function and reduce surgical risk. In gastrectomized patients, because the stomach cannot be used as a substitute, securing graft blood supply is critical, but microvascular anastomosis cannot be easily added in procedures for intrathoracic posterior mediastinal reconstruction. Thus, we have developed a novel technique for esophageal reconstruction in gastrectomized patients who are elderly or who had undergone HNC surgery, enabling concomitant intrathoracic anastomosis and microvascular anastomosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness and safety of this technique.",esophageal reconstruction; intrathoracic anastomosis; microvascular anastomosis.,Takushi Yasuda;Osamu Shiraishi;Mitsuru Iwama;Tomoki Makino;Hiroaki Kato;Yutaka Kimura,chest
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26825037/,Endothelin-1 in the tumor microenvironment correlates with melanoma invasion,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a vasoactive peptide that also plays a role in the tanning response of the skin. Animal and cell culture studies have also implicated ET-1 in melanoma progression, but no association studies have been performed to link ET-1 expression and melanoma in humans. Here, we present the first in-vivo study of ET-1 expression in pigmented lesions in humans: an ET-1 immunohistochemical screen of melanocytic nevi, melanoma in situ lesions, invasive melanomas, metastatic melanomas, and blue nevi was performed. Twenty-six percent of melanocytic nevi and 44% of melanoma in situ lesions demonstrate ET-1 expression in the perilesional microenvironment, whereas expression in nevus or melanoma cells was rare to absent. In striking contrast, 100% of moderately to highly pigmented invasive melanomas contained numerous ET-1-positive cells in the tumor microenvironment, with 79% containing ET-1-positive melanoma cells, confirmed by co-staining with melanoma tumor marker HMB45. Hypopigmented invasive melanomas had reduced ET-1 expression, suggesting a correlation between ET-1 expression and pigmented melanomas. ET-1-positive perilesional cells were CD68-positive, indicating macrophage origin. Sixty-two percent of highly pigmented metastatic melanomas demonstrated ET-1 expression in melanoma cells, in contrast to 28.2% of hypopigmented specimens. Eighty-nine percent of benign nevi, known as blue nevi, which have a dermal localization, were associated with numerous ET-1-positive macrophages in the perilesional microenvironment, but no ET-1 expression was detected in the melanocytes. We conclude that ET-1 expression in the microenvironment increases with advancing stages of melanocyte transformation, implicating a critical role for ET-1 in melanoma progression, and the importance of the tumor microenvironment in the melanoma phenotype.",,Luis Chiriboga;Shane Meehan;Iman Osman;Michael Glick;Gelo de la Cruz;Brittny S Howell;George Friedman-Jiménez;Robert J Schneider;Sumayah Jamal,melanoma

The aim of this study was to confirm, using two other techniques, whether hypertension is associated with hypoalgesia in humans. In 77 untreated essential hypertensive outpatients, 37 normotensive outpatients and 27 normotensive volunteers subjective cutaneous sensitivity was assessed by an electrical stimulator. Thirty-three measurements were repeated after one month. In addition, in eight normotensive volunteers and eight hypertensives the thresholds of the polysynaptic components R2 and R3 of the blink reflex to electrical stimulation of the supraorbitalis nerve were evaluated. Tooth pulp stimulation was done in 85 of the subjects who measured cutaneous sensitivity and in all of the blink reflex study. Cutaneous perceptive, pain and tolerance thresholds were significantly higher in the hypertensives compared with both normotensive groups, with no significant difference between these two. The results were identical when age and sex-matched subgroups were compared and a high reproducibility was found for all three parameters. Similar findings were obtained for the tooth pulp thresholds and highly statistically significant correlations were found between cutaneous and tooth pulp sensitivity and between these indices and blood pressure. The thresholds of R2 and R3 were also significantly higher in the hypertensives and a significant correlation was found between R3 threshold and diastolic pressure.

Each group was also evaluated, separating those with low plasma renin activity from the total sample. The sample group was made up of 75 young males; 31 hypertensives (mean age 22.7 +/- 2.5 years), 28 normotensives with hypertensive heredity (normotensives F+) (mean age 22.2 +/- 1.9 years) and 16 normotensives (mean age 22.0 +/- 2.1 years). An inverse correlation between ANF and PRA was shown in all groups. In hypertensives, ANF was inversely correlated with uKK (r = -0.664, P less than .0001). Plasma ANF (P less than .012) and DLS (P less than .0001) were higher in hypertensives than in normotensives, while uKK excretion was lower (P less than .0001). Plasma levels of DLS were higher in F+ normotensives than in normotensives (P less than .003).

The left kidney was removed at the age of 25, 35, 50 and 80 days (UNX 25, UNX 35, UNX 50, UNX 80), and 0.6% NaCl solution or water was offered as drinking fluid. In UNX DI rats drinking saline the mean value of blood pressure (BP) exceeded 150 torr. The highest values of BP were observed in DI UNX 25 females while no hypertension occurred in rats UNX 80. There was no correlation between individual values of BP and saline consumption in DI females with hypertension. However, individual BP values correlated with the urinary Na+/K+ ratio measured in the course of 24 h of water deprivation, due to age-dependent sodium excretion the values of which were highest in the UNX 25 group. Hydronephrosis was present in all DI rats with manifest hypertension. In hypertensive animals, BP values, Na+/K+ ratio and the frequency of hydronephrosis exhibited the same age dependence.

The present study was performed to investigate the effects of NPWT on the volume of the intra-thoracic organs, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in a porcine sternotomy wound model. Six pigs underwent median sternotomy followed by NPWT at -75, -125 and -175 mmHg. Six pigs were not sternotomised. MR images covering the thorax and heart were acquired. The volumes of the thoracic cavity, lungs, wound fluid and heart were then determined. The volumes of the thoracic cavity and intra-thoracic organs increased after sternotomy and decreased upon NPWT application. The total heart volume variation, which is inversely related to cardiac pumping efficiency, was higher after sternotomy and decreased during NPWT. NPWT did not result in the evacuation of wound fluid from the bottom of the wound. NPWT largely closes and restores the thoracic cavity.

Emphasis has been placed on using the same method of transplantation, keeping strict records on all passages, and applying the same investigative techniques, in order to trace tumor behavior over long periods of time. This tumor family consists of five variants linked by common origin, but which differ with respect to differentiation level, malignancy, intermediary metabolism, chromosome number, and cell surface properties. Once established, these melanomas possessed a considerable degree of phenotypic stability over decades of passaging. One tumor line in this family is emphasized. The Ab amelanotic melanoma lost its differentiated functions (the ability to synthetize melanin) a quarter of a century ago, and since then has remained dedifferentiated in serial passage in hamsters. After transfer to primary cell culture, the Ab melanoma cells differentiate readily and lose much of their proliferative potential. This process is reversible by reimplantation of the cells into a hamster.

Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome are the major complications of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection can activate innate and adaptive immune responses and result in massive inflammatory responses later in the disease. These uncontrolled inflammatory responses may lead to local and systemic tissue damage. In patients with severe COVID-19, eosinopenia and lymphopenia with a severe reduction in the frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells are a common feature. COVID-19 severity hinges on the development of cytokine storm characterized by elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, IgG-, IgM- and IgA-specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in most patients, along with the viral RNA, forming the basis for assays that aid in patient diagnosis. Elucidating the immunopathological outcomes due to COVID-19 could provide potential targets for immunotherapy and are important for choosing the best clinical management by consultants. Currently, along with standard supportive care, therapeutic approaches to COVID-19 treatment involve the use of antiviral agents that interfere with the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle to prevent further viral replication and utilizing immunomodulators to dampen the immune system in order to prevent cytokine storm and tissue damage. While current therapeutic options vary in efficacy, there are several molecules that were either shown to be effective against other viruses such as HIV or show promise in vitro that could be added to the growing arsenal of agents used to control COVID-19 severity and spread.",COVID-19; acute respiratory distress syndrome; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; hyperinflammation; immunopathology.,Abubakar Umar Anka;Mohammed Ibrahim Tahir;Sharafudeen Dahiru Abubakar;Mohamed Alsabbagh;Zeineb Zian;Haleh Hamedifar;Araz Sabzevari;Gholamreza Azizi,covid-19

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7912651/,"[Arterial hypertension, stress, and beta-blockers]","There is strong circumstantial evidence supporting the hypothesis that essential arterial hypertension is associated at least initially, with an augmented sympathetic activity. The link between the sympathetic nervous system and the hypertensive state is further supported by the clinical evidence furnished by the efficacy of drugs interfering with sympathetic control. In this lecture we address the role of behavioral and mental factors, globally indicated with the word ""stress"", that may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of the hypertensive condition. At the core of this approach, there is the view that, operationally, mental stress could be conveniently substituted by some quantification of the sympathetic activity (in its continuous balance with vagal modulation). In our laboratory we employ the normalized power of the low frequency (LF, 0.1 Hz) component of the autospectra of RR interval variability as an index of sympathetic drive. In hypertensives at rest there is a prevalence of LF (as compared to the HF, high frequency, component, which is a marker of vagal activity). Additionally the responsiveness to both physical and mental stimuli is diminished. After chronic beta-adrenergic blockade, the spectral profile, and its responsiveness, returns toward normal. Furthermore the gain of baroreflex mechanisms (obtained with cross spectral analysis of RR interval and systolic arterial pressure variability) is also increased by atenolol treatment. We conclude that this approach may permit a better quantification of the role played by behavioral and mental factors in essential hypertension, and help to define individualized treatments.",,M Pagani,hypertension

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6581123/,Essential hypertension: improved differentiation by the temperature dependence of Li efflux in erythrocytes,"Kinetic and thermodynamic properties of red cell lithium (Li) efflux were examined in patients with essential hypertension; the maximal rate of Li efflux as affected by temperature was measured at the range of 12 degrees to 42 degrees C. Fifty-two patients with essential hypertension and 22 normotensives were studied. The mean Li efflux, both into sodium (Na) medium and Li-Na countertransport, was higher in hypertensive than in normotensive persons, but the distinction between the two groups was limited by extended scatter and overlap. The distinction could be markedly improved by determining the effect of temperature on Li efflux. While all the normotensives exhibited Arrhenius plots of Li efflux with a change in slope (""break"") around 30 degrees C, the corresponding ""break"" for most (75%) of the hypertensives was about 20 degrees C. Consideration of both the rate and the temperature dependence of Li efflux further improved the differentiation of hypertensive patients. Analysis of normotensive offspring of hypertensives and of patients with secondary hypertension indicates that the temperature dependence of Li efflux may serve as a genetic marker for essential hypertension.",,R Levy;E Paran;A Keynan;A Livne,hypertension

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33720905/,A majority of uninfected adults show preexisting antibody reactivity against SARS-CoV-2,"Preexisting cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 occurs in the absence of prior viral exposure. However, this has been difficult to quantify at the population level due to a lack of reliably defined seroreactivity thresholds. Using an orthogonal antibody testing approach, we estimated that about 0.6% of nontriaged adults from the greater Vancouver, Canada, area between May 17 and June 19, 2020, showed clear evidence of a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, after adjusting for false-positive and false-negative test results. Using a highly sensitive multiplex assay and positive/negative thresholds established in infants in whom maternal antibodies have waned, we determined that more than 90% of uninfected adults showed antibody reactivity against the spike protein, receptor-binding domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD), or the nucleocapsid (N) protein from SARS-CoV-2. This seroreactivity was evenly distributed across age and sex, correlated with circulating coronaviruses' reactivity, and was partially outcompeted by soluble circulating coronaviruses' spike. Using a custom SARS-CoV-2 peptide mapping array, we found that this antibody reactivity broadly mapped to spike and to conserved nonstructural viral proteins. We conclude that most adults display preexisting antibody cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2, which further supports investigation of how this may impact the clinical severity of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses.",Adaptive immunity; COVID-19; Immunology.,Abdelilah Majdoubi;Christina Michalski;Sarah E O'Connell;Sarah Dada;Sandeep Narpala;Jean Gelinas;Disha Mehta;Claire Cheung;Dirk Fh Winkler;Manjula Basappa;Aaron C Liu;Matthias Görges;Vilte E Barakauskas;Mike Irvine;Jennifer Mehalko;Dominic Esposito;Inna Sekirov;Agatha N Jassem;David M Goldfarb;Steven Pelech;Daniel C Douek;Adrian B McDermott;Pascal M Lavoie,covid-19

During different sodium intakes (normal = 120 mEq/day, low = 40 mEq/day and high = 240 mEq/day) fractional lithium excretion was evaluated in essential hypertensive patients (n. 19) and control subjects (n. 5). Our data showed that FeLi was higher in hypertensives than in controls. Dividing hypertensives on the basis of blood-pressure sensitivity, salt resistant patients showed lower FeLi levels as compared to salt sensitive ones. Our findings indicate that proximal tubular sodium reabsorption is decreased in essential hypertension; this behavior is particularly evident in salt sensitive patients, suggesting that factors affecting proximal tubular function are activated in these patients in order to reduce the impairment of renal excretory capability.",,R L Luparini;A Montini;R Satira;C Ferri;C Giarrizzo;M Pennacchia;G Germanõ;A Santucci,hypertension
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/736121/,Renal excretion of prostaglandins E2 and F2alpha in diabetes insipidus rats,"On the assumption that the antagonism between prostaglandin E2 and vasopressin might represent a negative feedback system, we evaluated the hypothesis that vasopressin stimulates, in vivo, the renal production of prostaglandins. For these studies we used Brattleboro homozygous rats with diabetes insipidus and Long-Evans rats for controls, Brattleboro homozygotes show a substantial reduction in the renal excretion of prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2alpha. Homozygotes excreted 39 +/- 5 ng/24 h prostaglandin E2 and 40 +/- 4 ng/24 h prostaglandin F2alpha, compared to 217 +/- 40 and 221 +/- 18 ng/24 h, respectively, in control rats (P less than 0.001). Therapy of homozygotes with vasopressin tannate in oil resulted in a prompt increase in the urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2alpha. 1-Desamino-D-arginine vasopressin, a nonpressor analogue of vasopressin, also enhanced the renal production of prostaglandin E2. We conclude that vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) stimulates renal production and excretion of prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2alpha in vivo. It is possible that this increment of prostaglandin synthesis serves a negative feedback function by modulating the action of vasopressin on the renal tubule.",,M J Dunn;H P Greely;H Valtin;L B Kintner;R Beeuwkes 3rd,diabetes

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32931361/,Prospects for mucosal vaccine: shutting the door on SARS-CoV-2,"The sudden emergence of a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019 from China and its rapid global spread has posed an international health emergency. The rapid development of an effective vaccine is imperative to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. A number of concurrent efforts to find an effective therapeutic agent or vaccine for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) are being undertaken globally. Oral and nasal mucosal surfaces serve as the primary portal of entry for pathogens like coronaviruses in the human body. As evidenced by studies on similar coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), mucosal vaccination can provide a safe and effective means for the induction of long-lasting systemic and mucosal immunity to confer protection against SARS-CoV-2. This article summarizes the approaches to an effective mucosal vaccine formulation which can be a rewarding approach to combat the unprecedented threat posed by this emerging global pandemic.",Coronavirus; Covid-19; SARS-CoV-2; mucosal vaccine; vaccine.,Rajat Mudgal;Sanketkumar Nehul;Shailly Tomar,covid-19
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33905620/,"Simple, Inexpensive RNA Isolation and One-Step RT-qPCR Methods for SARS-CoV-2 Detection and General Use","The most common method for RNA detection involves reverse transcription followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. Commercial one-step master mixes-which include both a reverse transcriptase and a thermostable polymerase and thus allow performing both the RT and qPCR steps consecutively in a sealed well-are key reagents for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing; yet, these are typically expensive and have been affected by supply shortages in periods of high demand. As an alternative, we describe here how to express and purify Taq polymerase and M-MLV reverse transcriptase and assemble a homemade one-step RT-qPCR master mix. This mix can be easily assembled from scratch in any laboratory equipped for protein purification. We also describe two simple alternative methods to prepare clinical swab samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by RT-qPCR: heat-inactivation for direct addition, and concentration of RNA by isopropanol precipitation. Finally, we describe how to perform RT-qPCR using the homemade master mix, how to prepare in vitro-transcribed RNA standards, and how to use a fluorescence imager for endpoint detection of RT-PCR amplification in the absence of a qPCR machine In addition to being useful for diagnostics, these versatile protocols may be adapted for nucleic acid quantification in basic research. © 2021 The Authors.
