The diaphragmatic muscle was cut by an electric knife along the line of 1 to 2 cm from the chest wall from anterior and lateral to posterior. The diaphragm including the tendon center is dissected from the peritoneum. The peritoneum should be preserved. If the peritoneum is opened, it should be repaired by sutures. The pericardium is opened at the apex. The pericardium incision is extended from the apex to cranial side. And then, it is cut from the apex to posterior with the diaphragm. And next, the incision of the cranial side edge is extended to posterior. The lower pulmonary vein, upper pulmonary vein, and pulmonary artery are exposed. They are encircled and divided in the pericardium by autosutures. A Goretex sheet with 1 mm thickness is used to reconstruct the diaphragm. \u001b[33mNine sutures were placed in advance for the Goretex, and pulled out from the chest cavity through upper and lower sides of the 10th or 9th rib.\u001b[0m The sutures were tied outside the rib cage. \u001b[33mFor mediastinal side, the Goretex was sutured to the residual diaphragm.\u001b[0m \u001b[33mA Goretex sheet with 0.1 mm thickness is used to reconstruct the pericardium by interrupted sutures.\u001b[0m Because the contralateral lung is overinflated, the reconstruction should not be tight.

      "The paraventricular nucleus of the rat hypothalamus has been shown to project to the medulla and spinal cord. The proportion of oxytocin-neurophysin (OTNP) axons to vasopressin-neurophysin (VPNP) axons in these structures is unknown. A major difficulty in resolving this problem in previous immunocytochemical studies was the lack of a specific antiserum to each rat neurophysin. \u001b[33mIn this study two approaches have been used: (1) comparison of immunostaining for neurophysin in normal versus homozygous Brattleboro rats with diabetes insipidus (HODI) which lack VPNP, and (2) application of an antiserum to both rat neurophysins absorbed with HODI rat hypothalamic-pituitary extracts which contain only OTNP.\u001b[0m The latter would result in an antiserum specific for VPNP. \u001b[33mOur results indicate that the axons which constitute the caudal projections from the paraventricular nucleus are predominately oxytocinergic, the vasopressinergic innervation being limited to the nucleus tractus solitarius, the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, and the substantia gelatinosa.\u001b[0m A similar number of reactive fibers were seen in the medulla and spinal cord of normal and HODI rats. No positive perikarya were observed caudal to the hypothalamus. \u001b[33mFibers in the medulla appeared to terminate in the nucleus of the solitary tract and in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve.\u001b[0m Positive fibers throughout the cord were present in the substantia gelatinosa and in the intermediolateral grey. The possible role(s) of these projections in integrating autonomic functions and afferent information with neuroendocrine regulation is discussed.\n",
