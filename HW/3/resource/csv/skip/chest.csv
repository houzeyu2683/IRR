https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27048219/,Management of chest drainage tubes after lung surgery,"Since chest tubes have been routinely used to drain the pleural space, particularly after lung surgery, the management of chest tubes is considered to be essential for the thoracic surgeon. The pleural drainage system requires effective drainage, suction, and water-sealing. Another key point of chest tube management is that a water seal is considered to be superior to suction for most air leaks. Nowadays, the most common pleural drainage device attached to the chest tube is the three-bottle system. An electronic chest drainage system has been developed that is effective in standardizing the postoperative management of chest tubes. More liberal use of digital drainage devices in the postoperative management of the pleural space is warranted. The removal of chest tubes is a common procedure occurring almost daily in hospitals throughout the world. Extraction of the tube is usually done at the end of full inspiration or at the end of full expiration. The tube removal technique is not as important as how it is done and the preparation for the procedure. The management of chest tubes must be based on careful observation, the patient's characteristics, and the operative procedures that had been performed.",Chest tube; Device; Drainage; Management; Thoracic surgery.,Yukitoshi Satoh
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30675928/,What is the real cardiac anatomy?,"The heart is a remarkably complex organ. Teaching its details to medical students and clinical trainees can be very difficult. Despite the complexity, accurate recognition of these details is a pre-requisite for the subsequent understanding of clinical cardiologists and cardiac surgeons. A recent publication promoted the benefits of virtual reconstructions in facilitating the initial understanding achieved by medical students. If such teaching is to achieve its greatest value, the datasets used to provide the virtual images should themselves be anatomically accurate. They should also take note of a basic rule of human anatomy, namely that components of all organs should be described as they are normally situated within the body. It is almost universal at present for textbooks of anatomy to illustrate the heart as if removed from the body and positioned on its apex, the so-called Valentine situation. In the years prior to the emergence of interventional techniques to treat cardiac diseases, this approach was of limited significance. Nowadays, therapeutic interventions are commonplace worldwide. Advances in three-dimensional imaging technology, furthermore, now mean that the separate components of the heart can readily be segmented, and then shown in attitudinally appropriate fashion. In this review, we demonstrate how such virtual dissection of computed tomographic datasets in attitudinally appropriate fashion reveals the true details of cardiac anatomy. The virtual approach to teaching the arrangement of the cardiac components has much to commend it. If it is to be used, nonetheless, the anatomical details on which the reconstructions are based must be accurate. Clin. Anat. 32:288-309, 2019. © 2019 The Authors.

Although rare, the migration of the colonoscope may represent life-threatening events, requiring emergency treatment. We, herein, describe the case of an elective colonoscopy complicated by an irretrievable colonoscope that migrated, through a previous traumatic diaphragmatic hernia, in the chest cavity. This hernia was likely a chronic complication of a previous abdominal trauma. Several attempts to retrieve the scope were unsuccessful. After further investigations and collegial discussion, a left thoracotomy was performed, with the aim to retrieve the colonoscope and to reduce the hernia.",colonoscopy; thoracotomy; traumatic diaphragmatic hernia.,Muhammad Usman Shah;Ahmed Eissa;Vincenzo Caruso;Sudhir Bhusari
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27283911/,Action of the diaphragm on the rib cage,"When the diaphragm contracts, pleural pressure falls, exerting a caudal and inward force on the entire rib cage. However, the diaphragm also exerts forces in the cranial and outward direction on the lower ribs. One of these forces, the ""insertional force,"" is applied by the muscle at its attachments to the lower ribs. The second, the ""appositional force,"" is due to the transmission of abdominal pressure to the lower rib cage in the zone of apposition. In the control condition at functional residual capacity, the effects of these two forces on the lower ribs are nearly equal and outweigh the effect of pleural pressure, whereas for the upper ribs, the effect of pleural pressure is greater. The balance between these effects, however, may be altered. When the abdomen is given a mechanical support, the insertional and appositional forces are increased, so that the muscle produces a larger expansion of the lower rib cage and, with it, a smaller retraction of the upper rib cage. In contrast, at higher lung volumes the zone of apposition is decreased, and pleural pressure is the dominant force on the lower ribs as well. Consequently, although the force exerted by the diaphragm on these ribs remains inspiratory, rib displacement is reversed into a caudal-inward displacement. This mechanism likely explains the inspiratory retraction of the lateral walls of the lower rib cage observed in many subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Hoover's sign). These observations support the use of a three-compartment, rather than a two-compartment, model to describe chest wall mechanics.",Hoover's sign; diaphragm insertional force; mechanics of breathing; zone of apposition.,André De Troyer;Theodore A Wilson

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32749075/,PleThora: Pleural effusion and thoracic cavity segmentations in diseased lungs for benchmarking chest CT processing pipelines,"This manuscript describes a dataset of thoracic cavity segmentations and discrete pleural effusion segmentations we have annotated on 402 computed tomography (CT) scans acquired from patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The segmentation of these anatomic regions precedes fundamental tasks in image analysis pipelines such as lung structure segmentation, lesion detection, and radiomics feature extraction. Bilateral thoracic cavity volumes and pleural effusion volumes were manually segmented on CT scans acquired from The Cancer Imaging Archive ""NSCLC Radiomics"" data collection. Four hundred and two thoracic segmentations were first generated automatically by a U-Net based algorithm trained on chest CTs without cancer, manually corrected by a medical student to include the complete thoracic cavity (normal, pathologic, and atelectatic lung parenchyma, lung hilum, pleural effusion, fibrosis, nodules, tumor, and other anatomic anomalies), and revised by a radiation oncologist or a radiologist. Seventy-eight pleural effusions were manually segmented by a medical student and revised by a radiologist or radiation oncologist. Interobserver agreement between the radiation oncologist and radiologist corrections was acceptable. All expert-vetted segmentations are publicly available in NIfTI format through The Cancer Imaging Archive at https://doi.org/10.7937/tcia.2020.6c7y-gq39. Tabular data detailing clinical and technical metadata linked to segmentation cases are also available. Thoracic cavity segmentations will be valuable for developing image analysis pipelines on pathologic lungs - where current automated algorithms struggle most. In conjunction with gross tumor volume segmentations already available from ""NSCLC Radiomics,"" pleural effusion segmentations may be valuable for investigating radiomics profile differences between effusion and primary tumor or training algorithms to discriminate between them.",computer-aided decision support systems; image processing; image segmentation techniques; informatics in imaging; quantitative imaging.,Kendall J Kiser;Sara Ahmed;Sonja Stieb;Abdallah S R Mohamed;Hesham Elhalawani;Peter Y S Park;Nathan S Doyle;Brandon J Wang;Arko Barman;Zhao Li;W Jim Zheng;Clifton D Fuller;Luca Giancardo

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29860552/,Accessory liver within the thoracic cavity,"Ectopic intrathoracic liver tissue is extremely rare. Studies are mainly limited to case reports. In the vast majority of reported cases, a diagnosis of intrathoracic liver tissue was made either after a thoracic surgery or during a postmortem examination. However, once included in differential diagnosis, surgical intervention or biopsy procedures may be avoided with optimal diagnostic approach. In the present study, we conducted a literature review and proposed a new classification method for accessory liver within the thoracic cavity. This approach may provide a better understanding of underlying pathophysiology and aid in determination of optimal diagnostic modality and clinical management of such cases. According to our literature review, type II ectopic liver is the most common subtype followed by types I and III. All types can be definitively diagnosed with imaging modalities. On the other hand, it is important to prevent patients, particularly children, from unnecessary radiation exposure during performance of sophisticated diagnostic imaging modalities. Ultrasound is a safe, low-cost and accessible imaging modality that has not been previously reported in diagnosis of this entity. With addition of Color Doppler Imaging, ultrasound may allow for diagnosis with high precision in types I and II, as demonstrated in the present study. Based on long-term follow-up of a case reported here, this study also illustrates the natural course of this entity via non-operative management.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25957746/,Thoracic cavity definition for 3D PET/CT analysis and visualization,"X-ray computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) serve as the standard imaging modalities for lung-cancer management. CT gives anatomical details on diagnostic regions of interest (ROIs), while PET gives highly specific functional information. During the lung-cancer management process, a patient receives a co-registered whole-body PET/CT scan pair and a dedicated high-resolution chest CT scan. With these data, multimodal PET/CT ROI information can be gleaned to facilitate disease management. Effective image segmentation of the thoracic cavity, however, is needed to focus attention on the central chest. We present an automatic method for thoracic cavity segmentation from 3D CT scans. We then demonstrate how the method facilitates 3D ROI localization and visualization in patient multimodal imaging studies. Our segmentation method draws upon digital topological and morphological operations, active-contour analysis, and key organ landmarks. Using a large patient database, the method showed high agreement to ground-truth regions, with a mean coverage=99.2% and leakage=0.52%. Furthermore, it enabled extremely fast computation. For PET/CT lesion analysis, the segmentation method reduced ROI search space by 97.7% for a whole-body scan, or nearly 3 times greater than that achieved by a lung mask. Despite this reduction, we achieved 100% true-positive ROI detection, while also reducing the false-positive (FP) detection rate by >5 times over that achieved with a lung mask. Finally, the method greatly improved PET/CT visualization by eliminating false PET-avid obscurations arising from the heart, bones, and liver. In particular, PET MIP views and fused PET/CT renderings depicted unprecedented clarity of the lesions and neighboring anatomical structures truly relevant to lung-cancer assessment.",CT imaging; Chest; Image segmentation; Lung cancer; Multimodal imaging; PET/CT; Pulmonary imaging; Thoracic region segmentation; Visualization.,Ronnarit Cheirsilp;Rebecca Bascom;Thomas W Allen;William E Higgins
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31772147/,Cavity Formation is a Prognostic Indicator for Pathologic Stage I Invasive Lung Adenocarcinoma of ≥3 cm in Size,"BACKGROUND We investigated the correlation between cavity formation, prognosis, and tumor stage for pathologic stage I invasive lung adenocarcinomas (IADCs) ≤3 cm in size. MATERIAL AND METHODS 2106 candidates with pathologic stage I IADC were identified from Shanghai Chest Hospital between 2009 and 2014. There were 227 patients who were diagnosed as having cavity formation and another 1879 patients who were not (the non-cavitary lung cancer group). Kaplan-Meier analysis curves were conducted to compare the overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) between these 2 groups. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to discover the independent risk factors of OS and RFS. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was done to determine the cutoff value of cavity size for predicting prognosis. Furthermore, subgroup analysis was stratified by the size of tumor and the 8th classification of T category. RESULTS Compared with non-cavitary lung cancer group, patients with cavity formation were found to have a higher prevalence of male patients (P=0.015), older age patients (P=0.039), larger size tumors (P=0.004), and worse cancer relapse (P<0.001). Survival analysis found that patients with cavitary IADC had significantly shorter RFS than those with non-cavitary IADC (P=0.001). Further, subgroup analysis confirmed a significantly worse RFS in cavitary IADC group both in stage T1a (P=0.002) and T1b (P<0.001), but not for stage T1c (P=0.962) and T2a (P=0.364). Moreover, cavity formation was still less of a significant predictor of RFS in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 1.810, 95% confidence level [CI] 1.229-2.665, P=0.003). The ROC curve showed that the best cutoff value of maximum diameter of the cavity for judging RFS was 5 mm (sensitivity: 0.500; specificity: 0.783). At the same time, multiple cavities were more likely to lead to recurrence (sensitivity: 0.605; specificity: 0.439). CONCLUSIONS Cavitary adenocarcinoma was a worse prognostic indicator compared with non-cavitary adenocarcinoma, especially for cavity >5 mm and multiple cavities. Thus, for stage T1a and T1b, cavitary and non-cavitary IADC should be considered separately.",,Chunji Chen;Shijie Fu;Qiming Ni;Wang Yiyang;Xufeng Pan;Jiao Jing;Heng Zhao;Wang Rui
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20447048/,Anti-adhesive membrane for pleural cavity,"An anti-adhesive membrane containing a large amount of glycerin was developed for lung surgery and was tested in the pleural cavity of six dogs. The test membranes were put between the lung and the chest wound of the pleural cavity wall to separate them. In five of the animals, no adhesion was observed after 3 weeks in the area where the membrane had been inserted, but the area without the membrane showed firm adhesion between the lung and the pleural cavity wall. A sixth animal observed for 3 months also showed no adhesion. Seprafilm, which is the product of choice for peritoneal surgeries, was used as a control in six dogs. Seprafilm could not prevent adhesion in the pleural cavity of all six animals after 3 weeks observation. The new test membrane contained glycerin, which gathered and dispersed abundant water. Together with this, growth factors are also dispersed, resulting in dilution of excessive growth factors at the wound sites. In general, fibroblasts do not migrate in an extremely hydrous gel matrix. Migration of fibroblasts into the membrane is minimized, resulting in the prevention of formation of adhesion tissue composed of fibroblasts and collagen fibers. From the results, we assume that water can prevent adhesion after surgery.",,Yasuharu Noishiki;Noriyuki Shintani

Over the course of light delivery, detectors at each of eight different sites recorded exposure to variable fluence rate. Nevertheless, the treatment-averaged fluence rate was similar among sites, ranging from a median of 40-61 mW cm-2 during periods of light exposure to a detector. St O2 at each tissue site varied by subject, but posterior mediastinum and posterior sulcus were the most consistently well oxygenated (median St O2 >90%; interquartile ranges ~85-95%). PDT effect on St O2 was characterized as the St O2 ratio (post-PDT St O2 /pre-PDT St O2 ). High St O2 pre-PDT was significantly associated with oxygen depletion (St O2 ratio < 1), although the extent of oxygen depletion was mild (median St O2 ratio of 0.8). Overall, PDT of the thoracic cavity resulted in moderate treatment-averaged fluence rate that was consistent among treated tissue sites, despite instantaneous exposure to high fluence rate. Mild oxygen depletion after PDT was experienced at tissue sites with high pre-PDT St O2 , which may suggest the presence of a treatment effect.",,Pamela J Dupre;Yi Hong Ong;Joseph Friedberg;Sunil Singhal;Shirron Carter;Charles B Simone 2nd;Jarod C Finlay;Timothy C Zhu;Keith A Cengel;Theresa M Busch

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23009260/,Pleural function and lymphatics,"The pleural space plays an important role in respiratory function as the negative intrapleural pressure regimen ensures lung expansion and in the mean time maintains the tight mechanical coupling between the lung and the chest wall. The efficiency of the lung-chest wall coupling depends upon pleural liquid volume, which in turn reflects the balance between the filtration of fluid into and its egress out of the cavity. While filtration occurs through a single mechanism passively driving fluid from the interstitium of the parietal pleura into the cavity, several mechanisms may co-operate to remove pleural fluid. Among these, the pleural lymphatic system emerges as the most important one in quantitative terms and the only one able to cope with variable pleural fluid volume and drainage requirements. In this review, we present a detailed account of the actual knowledge on: (a) the complex morphology of the pleural lymphatic system, (b) the mechanism supporting pleural lymph formation and propulsion, (c) the dependence of pleural lymphatic function upon local tissue mechanics and (d) the effect of lymphatic inefficiency in the development of clinically severe pleural and, more in general, respiratory pathologies.",,D Negrini;A Moriondo

Materials and methods: Ninety-eight patients who underwent lung resection were included in the study over a period of 12 months. The ΔP prior to chest tube removal in patients who developed a residual pneumothorax after chest tube removal was compared with that of patients who did not develop this complication. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to identify cutoff values of ΔP for the prediction of residual pneumothorax. Logistic regression analysis was used to formulate a prediction model for the occurrence of residual pneumothorax based on ΔP. Results: Thirteen patients who developed a residual pneumothorax were compared with 85 patients without this complication. The ΔP in the residual pneumothorax group was significantly higher (10.8 versus 4.2 cm H2O, p < 0.01). The ΔP in patients who required intervention was also significantly higher (14.8 versus 4.2 cm H2O, p < 0.01). A ΔP cutoff value of 8 cm H2O was predictive of the occurrence of residual pneumothorax (sensitivity 85.6%, specificity 84.6%) and a value of 12 cm H2O was predictive of intervention (sensitivity 84%, specificity 85%). Increasing ΔP was an independent predictor of the occurrence of residual pneumothorax (p = 0.008) on the multivariate logistic regression model. Conclusion: Patients with wide ΔP before chest drain removal may be complicated with residual pneumothorax.",chest tube removal; pleural pressures; residual pneumothorax.,Vasileios K Kouritas;Charalambos Zissis;Ion Bellenis

A 53 years old woman who had been diagnosed with intractable epilepsy, mental retardation and Chilaiditi syndrome was admitted to our hospital because of dyspnea and difficulty in conversation. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a mediastinal cystic lesion which expanded to the right chest cavity and occupied most of the right chest cavity.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29084801/,Microfluidic chest cavities reveal that transmural pressure controls the rate of lung development,"Mechanical forces are increasingly recognized to regulate morphogenesis, but how this is accomplished in the context of the multiple tissue types present within a developing organ remains unclear. Here, we use bioengineered 'microfluidic chest cavities' to precisely control the mechanical environment of the fetal lung. We show that transmural pressure controls airway branching morphogenesis, the frequency of airway smooth muscle contraction, and the rate of developmental maturation of the lungs, as assessed by transcriptional analyses. Time-lapse imaging reveals that branching events are synchronized across distant locations within the lung, and are preceded by long-duration waves of airway smooth muscle contraction. Higher transmural pressure decreases the interval between systemic smooth muscle contractions and increases the rate of morphogenesis of the airway epithelium. These data reveal that the mechanical properties of the microenvironment instruct crosstalk between different tissues to control the development of the embryonic lung.",Clock; Mechanical stress; Morphodynamics; Morphogenesis.,Celeste M Nelson;Jason P Gleghorn;Mei-Fong Pang;Jacob M Jaslove;Katharine Goodwin;Victor D Varner;Erin Miller;Derek C Radisky;Howard A Stone

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23523230/,[Pleural lymphatics and effusions],"The pleural lymphatic system has a great absorption capacity. Its most known function is fluid resorption. The pleura which cover the lungs (visceral pleura), the mediastinum, diaphragm and thoracic wall (parietal pleura) are formed by a mesothelial cell layer (mesothelium). This permeable layer is in direct contact with the vascular endothelium. The mesothelium is based over a connective tissue (interstitium) containing the blood and lymphatic vessels. The primary lymphatic vessels drain interstitium but are also in direct contact with pleural space by the stoma or openings, situated in the lower parts of parietal pleura, i.e: diaphragm, over lower ribs and mediastinum but not existing in the adjacent visceral pleura. In addition, a part of interstitial pulmonary fluid entered in the pleural cavity by passing the visceral pleura would be absorbed by these openings. The resorption process is active and directly related to the function of smooth muscles of lymphatic vessels. Besides resorption, we must emphasize that this ""pumping"" activity is permanent and the origin of negative pressure (the pleural void) in pleural cavity, a unique property. The other resorbed elements are molecules, bacterial and cellular debris, cells, red blood and cancer cells.",,P Mordant;A Arame;A Legras;F Le Pimpec Barthes;M Riquet

The operative procedures for anterior mediastinal lesions have been changed in a couple of decades from open surgery under median sternotomy to complete thoracoscopic mediastinal surgery with sternal lifting or carbon dioxide insufflation. Carbon dioxide insufflation of the thoracic cavity or the mediastinum is now prevailing to improve the surgical field and facilitate the operative procedures. Surgical indications for complete thoracoscopic mediastinal surgery include benign cystic lesions generally regardless of their size and non-invasive anterior mediastinal tumors usually less than 50~60 mm in the greatest dimension. There are currently three surgical approaches in the complete thoracoscopic surgery for the anterior mediastinal lesions. One is the unilateral or bilateral transthoracic approach. The second is the combination of the subxiphoid and the transthoracic approach. The last is the subxiphoid approach. The selection of the surgical approach depends on the surgeon's preference and experiences. When carbon dioxide insufflation is applied during the operation, following complications may occur;hypercapnia, gas embolism, subcutaneous emphysema, endotracheal tube dislocation due to the mediastinal sift, and hypotention. Special safety considerations are necessary during the complete thoracoscopic mediastinal surgery with carbon dioxide insufflation.",,Sumiko Maeda

Although fluid retention is a common adverse event associated with dasatinib, chylothorax is exceptionally rare. The pathological mechanism, clinical manifestation and management of dasatinib-induced chylothorax are completely unclear. A 71-year-old man treated with dasatinib for CML was admitted for progressive dyspnea. Computed tomography (CT) showed a pleural effusion that was more prominent on the right thoracic cavity. Thoracentesis showed thick milky pleural fluid, which was then confirmed as chylothorax by chylum qualitative tests and triglyceride measurements. Radionuclide lymphoscintigraphy yielded an obstruction at the end segment of the thoracic duct, but no leakage points were found. After excluding common causes, drug-induced chylothorax was presumed. Then, dasatinib was withdrawn, and 1 week later, chylothorax resolved. To further elucidate the relationship between the medication and chylothorax, dasatinib was resumed tentatively for 2 days. As expected, pleural effusion recurred soon. Based on these clinical manifestations, the diagnosis of dasatinib-induced chylothorax was identified. The patient was suggested to stop dasatinib and use an alternative drug as recommended by the haematologist. Pleural effusion is the common adverse reaction of dasatinib, but chylothorax is rare. Only six cases of dasatinib-induced chylothorax have been reported, and our patient is the seventh case. Once a patient with dasatinib treatment develops chylothorax, dasatinib should be considered one of the possible causes.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28789867/,Malignant pleural mesothelioma segmentation for photodynamic therapy planning,"Medical imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) combined with computer-aided diagnostic processing have already become important part of clinical routine specially for pleural diseases. The segmentation of the thoracic cavity represents an extremely important task in medical imaging for different reasons. Multiple features can be extracted by analyzing the thoracic cavity space and these features are signs of pleural diseases including the malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) which is the main focus of our research. This paper presents a method that detects the MPM in the thoracic cavity and plans the photodynamic therapy in the preoperative phase. This is achieved by using a texture analysis of the MPM region combined with a thoracic cavity segmentation method. The algorithm to segment the thoracic cavity consists of multiple stages. First, the rib cage structure is segmented using various image processing techniques. We used the segmented rib cage to detect feature points which represent the thoracic cavity boundaries. Next, the proposed method segments the structures of the inner thoracic cage and fits 2D closed curves to the detected pleural cavity features in each slice. The missing bone structures are interpolated using a prior knowledge from manual segmentation performed by an expert. Next, the tumor region is segmented inside the thoracic cavity using a texture analysis approach. Finally, the contact surface between the tumor region and the thoracic cavity curves is reconstructed in order to plan the photodynamic therapy. Using the adjusted output of the thoracic cavity segmentation method and the MPM segmentation method, we evaluated the contact surface generated from these two steps by comparing it to the ground truth. For this evaluation, we used 10 CT scans with pathologically confirmed MPM at stages 1 and 2. We obtained a high similarity rate between the manually planned surface and our proposed method. The average value of Jaccard index was about 0.79 and we obtained a value of 0.88 using the Dice index.",Computed tomography; Malignant pleural mesothelioma; Mesothelioma texture analysis; Photodynamic therapy; Thoracic cavity segmentation.,Wael Brahim;Makram Mestiri;Nacim Betrouni;Kamel Hamrouni

These tumors can be quite large at presentation with involvement of the chest wall, sympathetic chain, spine, and aortic arch. The tumors can also extend into the thoracic inlet and encircle the brachial plexus. Depending on the diagnosis, treatment may involve chemotherapy with subsequent surgery or require primary resection. Optimal exposure to resect large apical tumors with thoracic inlet extension is a surgical challenge. To date, several surgical techniques have been described to resect these tumors - including both anterior and posterior thoracic approaches. Each of these techniques can be limited by inadequate exposure of the mass. We describe an alternative approach to surgical resection of these masses that employs an extended sternotomy with a lateral neck incision.

Prospective, experimental study-animals: seven healthy adult horses, 4 females and 3 males. Left hemithorax thoracotomy was carried out to create an open pneumothorax for 60 minutes. Pleural pressure (Ppl) was directly obtained at the midpoint of the left eighth intercostal space before thoracotomy. Esophageal pressure (Pes), arterial blood gas analysis, left ventricular function, and ultrasonographic assessment of pneumothorax extent/resolution were performed at the baseline, and 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after thoracotomy, and on the first, second, third, fifth, and seventh days postoperatively. Intra-abdominal pressure was only recorded while the pneumothorax was present. There was moderate correlation (Spearman's rs = 0.404; R2 = 0.8; P < .00001; Bland-Altman bias = -2.59; s.d. = 2.11) between Pes and Ppl. Esophageal pressure increased (P < .05) after open pneumothorax until the fifth day postoperatively. Partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood reduced (P < .05) until the third day postoperatively when it returned to the baseline. No significant variations in PaCO2, pH in arterial blood, and in left ventricular function were appreciated. The extent of the pneumothorax was assessed by thoracic ultrasonography. Esophageal pressure, in association with blood gas analysis and thoracic ultrasonography, could be used to aid diagnosis of pneumothorax in horses. Horses tolerate open pneumothorax, with minimum cardiovascular impairment, even without aspiration of free air from within pleural space to restore thoracic wall integrity.",Arterial blood gas analysis; Equine; Esophageal pressure; Thoracic trauma; Thoracic ultrasonography.,Paulo A Canola;Carlos A A Valadão;Júlio C Canola;Fabíola N Flôres;Maristela C S Lopes

At age 68 years, a capsulated huge mass developed in the left pleural cavity, which was diagnosed as chronic expanding hematoma. Two years and 8 months after detection, the lesion began to invade the chest wall, and 10 months later, the patient died of active bleeding and direct compression of the heart by the lesion. At autopsy, the left thoracic cavity was occupied by a cystic and hemorrhagic mass infiltrating into the surrounding structures. In addition, scattered tumorous nodules were observed in the right lung. Histologically, angiosarcoma with irregularly anastomosing vessels lined with atypical endothelial cells was noted in the chronic expanding hematoma.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17685144/,[Thoracic drainage],"Pleural pathology is a frequent clinical problem. In some cases, treatment includes draining the cavity which can be carried out by thoracentesis evacuators, but on occasions treatment requires maintaining a drainage permanently inside the pleural cavity Pleural drainage consists in inserting a catheter in the pleural sack to drain the presence of air; liquid or blood which causes a variable degree of lung collapse having a clinical consequence in function of the reserve breathing capacity the patient previously had and the degree of collapse. There are various models of thoracic tubes as well as systems to drain the pleural cavity and their spot for insertion depends on the type of pathology being dealt with for the patient under treatment. Nursing is fundamental in this entire process, including in the preparation of the patient for this treatment, the insertion of the catheter and the adequate maintenance so that this procedure succeeds as well as during the removal of the catheter and the subsequent care required. It is fundamental that the nursing professionals know the materials used as well as their maintenance. A good technique to cure the punt/orifice where a catheter is inserted will prevent numerous complications which could be deadly for the patient. The authors create a procedural protocol for nurses to use when treating patients who have thoracic drains; this protocol deals with changing the catheters as well as the entire process related to how to treat patients with a pleural drain.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17495284/,A diagnostic approach to mediastinal abnormalities,"A number of mediastinal reflections are visible at conventional radiography that represent points of contact between the mediastinum and adjacent lung. The presence or distortion of these reflections is the key to the detection and interpretation of mediastinal abnormalities. Anterior mediastinal masses can be identified when the hilum overlay sign is present and the posterior mediastinal lines are preserved. Widening of the right paratracheal stripe and convexity relative to the aortopulmonary window reflection indicate a middle mediastinal abnormality. Disruption of the azygoesophageal recess can result from disease in either the middle or posterior mediastinum. Paravertebral masses disrupt the paraspinal lines, and the location of masses above the level of the clavicles can be inferred by their lateral margins, which are sharp in posterior masses but not in anterior masses. The divisions of the mediastinum are not absolute; however, referring to the local anatomy of the mediastinal reflections in an attempt to more accurately localize an abnormality may help narrow the differential diagnosis.

In the absence of prospective or randomised studies evidence-based treatment is normally based on personal experience, ideally in the possession of retrospective analyses using the ""best practice"" method. The aim of the authors was the review the up-to-date chylothorax treatments. They performed the PubMed database's ""chylothorax"" keyword search of the publications reported in the last ten years. They put emphasis on articles that included a comparative analysis of the various treatment options. During the critical analysis of the methods and recommendations, the authors relied on their own joint experience amounting to 39 years. The results showed that the success of the initial conservative treatment indicates a significant deviation depending on the etiology (3-90%). The success rate of non-invasive or semi-invasive interventions is between 50-100%, again depending on the etiology. The standard surgical treatment following an unsuccessful conservative treatment of an operable patient includes the fitting of a (thoracoscopic) knot to the ductus thoracicus, pleurodesis, insertion of a permanent chest drain or a pleuroperitoneal shunt. The success rate of these interventions is between 64-100%, with a morbidity index and mortality index exceeding 25%. Conservative treatment should be the first step, which should then be followed by a gradually increased aggressive therapy, during which the decisions should be made according to the patient's condition and the drain volume. Interventional radiology procedures are safe, successful and they can be offered concurrently with conservative or operative treatment, although they are available only in a few centres.",chylothorax; complication; mellkassebészet; szövődmény; thoracic surgery.,Zsolt Sziklavári;Péter Zsoldos;F Tamás Molnár

Oppression of the thoracic cavity was evaluated based on the length, depth, width and area of the thoracic cavity. To obtain thoracic radiographs at the terminal inspiration and expiration phases, thoracic fluororadiographs were recorded with a digital video camera. Bodyweight and the depth of the back fat layer at the seventh lumbar vertebra (DB, measured by ultrasonography) were used as indicators of the degree of obesity. The length of the thoracic cavity tended to become shorter and the depth and width of the thoracic cavity tended to increase as bodyweight increased and as DB increased. On the other hand, the area of the thoracic cavity was not clearly related to bodyweight or DB. These results suggest that oppression of the thoracic cavity due to the cranial shift of the diaphragm is compensated for by increases in the depth and width of the thoracic cavity in beagles with mild-to-moderate obesity.",,Toshio Morooka;Masayoshi Niiyama;Aki Kougo;Mayumi Soya;Katsunori Nunome

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32435892/,Identification and quantitative analysis of branching networks of the posterior intercostal arteries,"Morphological and anatomical characteristics of the posterior intercostal arteries have revived interest in their branching networks. Collateral supply between intercostal spaces is extensive due to anastomoses, although the data about the quantitative description of the branching networks in the existing literature are rather limited. The presence of collateral network between branches of the posterior intercostal arteries has been studied on forty-three Thiel-embalmed human cadavers. A network-based approach has been used to quantify the measured vascular branching patterns. Connections between branches of the same or adjacent posterior intercostal artery were identified. The non-anastomosing branches coursing in the intercostal spaces were also observed and their abundance was higher in comparison to anastomosing vessels. A quantitative analysis of collateral branching networks has revealed the highest density of vessels located close to the costal angle and most of the anastomosing branches were found between the fourth and tenth intercostal space. Anastomoses within the same posterior intercostal artery were more frequent in higher intercostal spaces, whereas in the lower intercostal spaces more connections were established between neighboring intercostal arteries. Our results indicate that due to abundant collateral contribution the possibility to cause an ischemic injury is rather low unless there is considerable damage to the blood supply of the trunk or surgical complication leading to ischemia or necrosis. Analyzing the proper course of collateral contributions of the posterior intercostal arteries may support further directions regarding the safest place for percutaneous transthoracic interventions, thoracocentesis, and lung biopsy.",Anastomoses; Intercostal space; Posterior intercostal artery; Vascular network.,L Kocbek Šaherl;M Gosak;M Rakuša

A 62-year-old woman presented with continuous pain in the left back associated with coughing and shortness of breath for more than 2 months prior to referral to the hospital. Palliative resection of a mediastinal tumor was performed. During the operation, it was found that the mass occupied most of the chest invading the chest wall, aorta, vena cava, and lung tissue. The patient soon died from diabetic complications in spite of anti-infection treatment. The tumor was composed of large areas of necrosis and anaplastic neoplastic giant cells with high mitotic activity, and osteoclast-like cells; there was marked inflammatory cell infiltration. The anaplastic neoplastic giant cells were immunoreactive for CKpan, CD5, CD45, VIM, and p53. Approximately 50% to 60% of the tumor cells showed immunoreactivity for Ki-67.

Chitosomes were prepared by directly hydrating the thin lipid film using chitosan solution as hydration medium, instead of using it as a coating agent. Developed chitosomes demonstrated spherical morphology, positive surface charge (~30 mV) and ~60% encapsulation efficiency. The calorimetric studies and X-ray diffraction pattern of Met-loaded chitosomes confirmed the successful encapsulation of Met inside the chitosome vesicles. Optimized chitosome formulation showed ~70% drug release in 72 h, displaying prolonged and controlled release of drug. Results demonstrated that Met encapsulated chitosomes possessed enhanced cellular internalization and improved cytotoxic potential. Our findings also supported inhibitory activity of chitosomes against metastatic property of pleural mesothelioma cells. The in-vitro tumor simulation studies further established anti-tumor activity of Met encapsulated chitosomes as supported by reduction in tumor volume and presence of minimal viable cells in tumor mass.

She had a thirty-year history of treatment for intracranial hemangioblastoma due to von Hippel-Lindau disease and hydrocephalus. Head magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated recurrent multiple hemangioblastoma in the cerebellum without hydrocephalus. Chest computed tomography showed a migrated distal tube of a VPS into the thoracic cavity. The VPS had been revised several times because of repeated infection before the present admission. The hydrocephalus was considered to be independent on the VPS because the VPS had become obstructed. A pleural effusion, which was probably caused by hypoalbuminemia during the postoperative course of the hemangioblastoma, increased and disappeared in association with her postoperative nutritional status. Therefore, revision of the migrated distal catheter was not needed. The distal tube most likely migrated through the intercostal space because the patient was very skinny.

At re-thoracotomy 6 weeks after implantation, all of the implanted fat grafts (n = 15) were found to have closely adhered to the parietal pleura and visceral pleura. There was a significant decrease by ∼30% in the weight of the fat grafts after implantation. Regardless of the weight loss, the implanted fat graft showed normal structuring without scar formation in the central area. Our results may suggest that free fat pads, which weighed up to 3 g, were successfully cultured in the thoracic cavity until the implanted tissues integrated into the surrounding tissues.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16642554/,Comparison of the ratio of upper to lower chest wall in children with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy and normally developed children,"The upper chest wall does not grow properly in children with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with paradoxical breathing. This suggests that long-term inability to take a deep breath in developing children may result in underdevelopment of the upper chest wall. In addition, a rapid and paradoxical breathing pattern is frequently observed in children with severe cerebral palsy (CP), which often corresponds to the underdevelopment of the upper chest wall. The present study is designed to evaluate the ratio of the upper to lower chest wall in children with severe spastic quadriplegic CP, compared with normal children. We compared normal children with children that had spastic quadriplegic CP who did not have kyphosis or scoliosis. Test subjects were matched in terms of age, height, and weight. The diameters of upper chest (D(apex)) and of lower chest (D(base)) were measured on the anteroposterior (AP) view of a chest X-ray and the D(apex) to D(base) ratio was calculated. In selected cases the forced vital capacity (FVC) was measured using a Wright Respirometer. The D(apex) to D(base) ratio was significantly lower in the CP group than in the control group (p < 0.001). The ratio increased linearly with age (p < 0.001) in both CP (R = 0.372) and control groups (R = 0.477). The FVC/preFVC showed significant correlation with the D(apex) to D(base) ratio (R = 0.542, p < 0.01).

Echocardiography is currently the most commonly used diagnostic tool for evaluation of cardiac anatomy and function. Complete with thoracic radiography and blood levels of two cardiac biomarkers, N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT), it gives an extensive examination of the cardiorespiratory system. The purpose of this cross-sectional cohort study is to describe normal thoracic anatomy using thoracic radiography, and to provide normal values for echocardiographic measurements in 20 ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta). Additionally, cardiac biomarkers were determined. Three radiographic projections of the thoracic cavity and a complete transthoracic echocardiography were performed in 20 clinically healthy ring-tailed lemurs during their annual health examinations. Similar standard right parasternal and left apical echocardiographic images were obtained as described in dogs and cats and normal values for routine two-dimensional (2D-), time-motion (M-) and Doppler mode measurements were generated. Furthermore, a noninvasive smartphone base ECG recording and blood concentrations of cardiac biomarkers were obtained. Other radiographic measurements are provided for the skeletal and respiratory systems such as the trachea to inlet ratio and tracheal inclination. Knowledge of the normal radiographic thoracic and echocardiographic anatomy and function are fundamental for the diagnosis and follow-up of cardiac disease in affected individuals and for species screening, and will be of added value in future research in and conservation of this endangered species.",Cardiac biomarkers; Lemur catta; echocardiography; radiography; ring-tailed lemurs; thorax.,Blandine Houdellier;Laurent Locquet;Jimmy H Saunders;Bart J G Broeckx;Tim Bouts;Pascale Smets

Although there are relatively many PUUV sequences available from different European countries, little is known about the presence of this virus in Poland. During population studies in 2009 a total of 45 bank voles were trapped at three sites in north-eastern Poland, namely islands on Dejguny and Dobskie Lakes and in a forest near Mikołajki. S and M segment-specific RT-PCR assays detected PUUV RNA in three animals from the Mikołajki site. The obtained partial S and M segment sequences demonstrated the highest similarity to the corresponding segments of a PUUV strain from Latvia. Analysis of chest cavity fluid samples by IgG ELISA using a yeast-expressed PUUV nucleocapsid protein resulted in the detection of two seropositive samples, both being also RT-PCR positive.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19265064/,Effect of acute inflation on the mechanics of the inspiratory muscles,"When the lung is inflated acutely, the capacity of the diaphragm to generate pressure, in particular pleural pressure (Ppl), is impaired because the muscle during contraction is shorter and generates less force. At very high lung volumes, the pressure-generating capacity of the diaphragm may be further reduced by an increase in the muscle radius of curvature. Lung inflation similarly impairs the pressure-generating capacity of the inspiratory intercostal muscles, both the parasternal intercostals and the external intercostals. In contrast to the diaphragm, however, this adverse effect is largely related to the orientation and motion of the ribs, rather than the ability of the muscles to generate force. During combined activation of the two sets of muscles, the change in Ppl is larger than during isolated diaphragm activation, and this added load on the diaphragm reduces the shortening of the muscle and increases muscle force. In addition, activation of the diaphragm suppresses the cranial displacement of the passive diaphragm that occurs during isolated intercostal contraction and increases the respiratory effect of the intercostals. As a result, the change in Ppl generated during combined diaphragm-intercostal activation is greater than the sum of the pressures generated during separate muscle activation. Although this synergistic interaction becomes particularly prominent at high lung volumes, lung inflation, either bilateral or unilateral, places a substantial stress on the inspiratory muscle pump.",,André De Troyer;Theodore A Wilson

A mock pump model of the CFTAH was rapid-prototyped using biocompatible materials. The model was brought to the operative table, and the direction, length, and angulation of the inflow/outflow ports and outflow conduits were evaluated after the recipient's ventricles had been resected. Thoracic cavity measurements were based on preoperative computed tomographic data. The CFTAH fit well in all five patients (height, 170 ± 9 cm; weight, 75 ± 24 kg). Body surface area was 1.9 ± 0.3 m (range, 1.6-2.1 m). The required inflow and outflow port orientation of both the left and right housings appeared consistent with the current version of the CFTAH implanted in calves. The left outflow conduit remained straight, but the right outflow direction necessitated a 73 ± 22 degree angulation to prevent potential kinking when crossing over the connected left outflow.

It is used externally by employing electrodes on the thorax but can also be used internally by electrodes within a cardiac pacemaker.

Fifteen healthy adult toco toucans (Ramphastos toco), 10 females and 5 males, average body mass of 650 g were studied. CT examination as well as right lateral and ventrodorsal radiographic examinations of the coelomic cavity were performed under chemical restraint. Heart, lungs, air sacs, trachea and syrinx were analysed. The mean values of heart length, heart width and thoracic cavity in radiographs were, respectively, 23.76 mm, 25.94 mm and 48.87 mm. In both X-rays and CT scans, the lung parenchyma had honeycomb-like pattern. The topographic areas of the anterior and posterior air sacs were visualized as dark and air-filled spaces in X-rays. On CT evaluation, the air sacs occupied a larger area in the coelomic cavity compared to X-ray. In the lateral radiographic view, the cervical part of the trachea was positioned more ventrally in the transition from cervical to thoracic regions showing a V-shaped appearance. In all CT planes was visible division of the trachea into the right and left main bronchi at the level of 3rd thoracic vertebra. The syrinx was difficult to visualize in X-rays, but on CT it was easily identified in axial slice.

At the early stage, xeno-acellular dermal matrix was grafted after debridement of abdominal wound; peritoneal lavage was performed; negative pressure drainage was performed in orificium fistula of intestine for promoting the adhesion between perforated intestine and abdominal scar. Two orificium fistulas formed after closure of abdominal granulation wound by autologous skin grafting. Eschar of chest wall and denatured ribs were retained. The risk of infection of thoracic cavity was decreased by promoting the adhesion between lung tissue and chest wall. During the treatment, the patient was diagnosed with Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis by renal biopsy, with the symptoms of purpura in the lower limbs, heavy proteinuria, severe hypoalbuminemia, edema, etc. After control of kidney damage by immunosuppressive treatment instead of glucocorticoid, alleviation of the levels of proteinuria and blood albumin, free latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap was excised to repair chest wall, and free skin graft was excised to repair intestinal fistula. After all the wounds were successfully covered, the patient was treated with glucocorticoid combined with immunosuppressants for more than 1 year. The patient was followed up for 3 years, and his renal function was completely recovered with satisfactory clinical outcome.",,Wei Zhang;Wei-guo Xie;Wei-xiong Min;De-yun Wang;Jia Zhang;Shi-yong Wan

Previous authors have described the use of prophylactic rigid plate fixation in high-risk patients. The purpose of our study is to review the use of prophylactic sternal platting with pectoralis advancement flaps in high-risk patients with a history of chest irradiation. Fourteen patients (July 2003-September 2008) with a history of chest irradiation who underwent a median sternotomy followed by prophylactic rigid plate fixation of the sternum were reviewed. Breast cancer was the most common etiology of chest irradiation (n=11, 78%). The average EuroSCORE was 24.06% with 72% of patients having a preoperative New York Heart Association (NYHA) class≥III. There were no episodes of sternal non-union, mediastinitis or death. Follow-up was 100% with a 0% 30-day and a 7.1% one-year mortality rate (non-cardiac). A comparison between mean preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (49.6%) and postoperative LVEF (59.7%) was statistically significant (P<0.0001). All living patients currently maintain a NYHA class I/II. Prophylactic rigid plate fixation and pectoralis flap coverage decreases the risk of developing sternal dehiscence and postoperative wound complications and should therefore be considered in high-risk patients with a history of chest irradiation.",,Keith C Neaman;Andrew L Blount;John A Kim;John D Renucci;Robert L Hooker
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29384599/,Combination video-assisted mediastinoscopic lymphadenectomy and transcervical thoracoscopy,"Surgical staging of lung and pleural cancers is crucial for planning treatment and assessing prognosis. In some cases, we need to explore both the mediastinum and the pleural cavity to confirm or rule out tumor dissemination. The combination of video-assisted mediastinoscopic lymphadenectomy (VAMLA) and thoracoscopy through a single transcervical incision allows the surgeon to widen the range of the exploration and improve the staging for lung and pleural cancers. VAMLA consists of complete removal of the mediastinal fat and lymph nodes of the subcarinal space, the right paratracheal and pretracheal areas, and the left paratracheal space. Once this mediastinal tissue is removed, the right mediastinal pleura can be identified and incised. A 30o thoracoscope is then inserted through the video-mediastinoscope into the pleural cavity to obtain samples of pleural fluid and biopsies of the parietal pleura and lung nodules, if present. In the case of left-sided thoracoscopy the access route to the left pleural cavity is anterior to the aortic arch, as for extended cervical mediastinoscopy. The combination of VAMLA and thoracoscopy is useful for exploring the mediastinum and the pleural space from a single incision and in the same surgical setting as the transcervical approach.",,Juan Carlos Trujillo-Reyes;Elisabeth Martínez-Téllez;Ramón Rami-Porta;Carme Obiols;Sergi Call;Josep Belda-Sanchis

The GRIN lens-based 3-D SS OCT system, which images at 39 fps with 512 A-lines per frame, was able to capture images of and detect abnormalities during thoracoscopy in the thoracic cavity, including the pleura, chest wall, pericardium, and the lungs. The abnormalities were confirmed by histological evaluation and compared to OCT findings. The dynamic tunable focal distance range and rapid speed of the probe and SS prototype OCT system enabled this first-reported application of in vivo 3-D thoracoscopic imaging of pleural-based malignancies. The imaging probe of the system was found to be easily adaptable to various sites within the thoracic cavity and can be readily adapted to other sites, including rigid airway endoscopic examinations.",,Tuqiang Xie;Gangjun Liu;Kelly Kreuter;Sari Mahon;Henri Colt;David Mukai;George M Peavy;Zhongping Chen;Matthew Brenner

The tumor contained an area with a high degree of calcification and was heterogeneously enhanced. Macroscopically, the resected tumor was 175×145×135 mm in size. Morphologically and immunohistochemically, this was comprised of a typical SFT juxtaposed to a high-grade component including an osteosarcomatous component. These were sharply demarcated by thin fibrous septa.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12376613/,The retrotracheal space: normal anatomic and pathologic appearances,"A variety of diseases can arise from the normal contents of the retrotracheal space or from adjacent structures. Mediastinal diseases in the retrotracheal space typically manifest radiographically as a contour abnormality or an area of increased opacity, although computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is usually required for diagnosis. The most common aortic arch anomaly, a right subclavian artery that originates from an otherwise normal left-sided aortic arch, appears at posteroanterior chest radiography as an obliquely oriented soft-tissue area of increased opacity that extends superiorly to the right from the superior margin of the aortic arch. CT and MR imaging can reveal associated vascular or mediastinal abnormalities. Aortic aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms can manifest radiographically as fusiform or saccular masslike lesions that protrude into the retrotracheal space. Thoracic MR imaging and spiral CT angiography are the diagnostic procedures of choice for evaluating diverse pathologic conditions of the thoracic aorta. Esophageal diseases can manifest as an abnormality in the retrotracheal space, which may be the initial clue to the diagnosis. At CT, lymphatic malformations in the mediastinum manifest as lobular, multicystic tumors that surround and infiltrate adjacent mediastinal structures. Familiarity with the normal radiologic appearance of the retrotracheal space and with the clinical manifestations of diseases that affect the retrotracheal space and adjacent structures can facilitate detection, diagnosis, and management.",,Tomás Franquet;Jeremy J Erasmus;Ana Giménez;Santiago Rossi;Rosa Prats

In a cardiothoracic wound model, we compared the degree of air displacement achieved by a new insufflation device, a gas-diffuser, with that of a thin open-ended tube during steady-state and with carbon dioxide flows of 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 L/min. We also studied air displacement at the start of and after discontinuation of carbon dioxide insufflation with the gas-diffuser and evaluated the influence of an open pleura. During steady state, the gas-diffuser produced efficient air displacement in the wound cavity model at carbon dioxide flows of > or = 5 L/min (< or = 0.65% remaining air), whereas the open-ended tube was inefficient (> or = 82% remaining air) at all studied carbon dioxide flows (P < 0.001). An open pleural cavity prolonged the time needed to obtain a high degree of air displacement in the wound cavity (P = 0.001).

Seven pigs underwent median sternotomy. Pressure transduction catheters were placed on the anterior surface of the heart (under the foam), in the pericardium (under the heart), in the left pleura and in the oesophagus at the level of the heart. The wound was sealed as for TNP therapy. The vacuum source was set to deliver negative pressures between -50 and -200 mmHg. The pressure on the anterior surface of the heart changed in a linear relationship with the applied negative pressure and was slightly lower than the applied negative pressure (-102 +/- 9 mmHg at delivered -125 mmHg). Further down in the thoracic cavity, in the pericardium (under the heart), in the left pleura and in the oesophagus, the wound pressure was only slightly affected by TNP therapy. In conclusion during TNP therapy, negative pressure is effectively transmitted to anterior portions of the heart. This may explain our recent findings that TNP increases microvascular blood flow in the myocardium. The pressure difference between the anterior and the posterior portions of the heart causes the right ventricle to be sucked up towards the posterior parts of the sternum, where it might be exposed to the sharp edges of the sternal bone, which may result in heart injury.",,Christian Torbrand;Richard Ingemansson;Lotta Gustafsson;Per Paulsson;Malin Malmsjö

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28859850/,"IL-4/5 signalling plays an important role during Litomosoides sigmodontis infection, influencing both immune system regulation and tissue pathology in the thoracic cavity","Approximately 100 million people suffer from filarial diseases including lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis), onchocerciasis (river blindness) and loiasis. These diseases are amongst the most devastating of the neglected tropical diseases in terms of social and economic impact. Moreover, many infection-induced immune mechanisms in the host, their relationship to disease-related symptoms and the development of pathology within the site of infection remain unclear. To improve on current drug therapies or vaccines, further studies are necessary to decipher the mechanisms behind filaria-driven immune responses and pathology development, and thus the rodent model of Litomosoides sigmodontis can be used to unravel host-filaria interactions. Interestingly, BALB/c mice develop a patent state (release of microfilariae, the transmission life-stage, into the periphery) when exposed to L. sigmodontis. Thus, using this model, we determined levels of host inflammation and pathology development during a L. sigmodontis infection in vivo for the first known time. Our study reveals that after 30days p.i., inflammation and pathology began to develop in infected wild type BALB/c mice between the lung and diaphragm, close to the site of infection - the thoracic cavity. Interestingly, infected IL-4Rα/IL-5-/- BALB/c mice had accentuated inflammation of the pleural lung and pleural diaphragm, and higher parasite burdens. Corresponding to the pleural inflammation, levels of IP-10, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MIP-2 and RANTES were significantly elevated in the thoracic cavity fluid of infected IL-4Rα/IL-5-/- mice compared with wild type controls. Moreover, upon L. sigmodontis antigen stimulation, IFN-γ and IL-17A secretions by cells isolated from draining lymph nodes of IL-4Rα/IL-5-/- mice were significantly elevated, whereas secretion of IL-5, IL-13 and IL-10 was reduced. Elevated filaria-specific IFN-γ secretion was also observed in spleen-derived CD4+ T cell co-cultures from IL-4Rα/IL-5-/- mice. In summary, this study unravels the essential role of IL-4/IL-5 signalling in controlling immunity against filarial infections and demonstrates the requirement of this pathway for the host to control ensuing pathology and inflammation.",Diaphragm; IL-4Rα/IL-5(−/−); Immune regulation; Litomosoides sigmodontis; Lung; Pathology; Thoracic cavity.,Manuel Ritter;Ruth S Tamadaho;Judith Feid;Wenzel Vogel;Katharina Wiszniewsky;Sven Perner;Achim Hoerauf;Laura E Layland

Results showed that cardiac silhouette width should occupy 81%-93% of sternal width, 48%-57% of thoracic width, and 506%-673% of coracoid width. The cardiac silhouette width was strongly correlated with sternal and thoracic widths. A moderate correlation was found between the width of the heart and the width of the coracoid.

The goal of this study was to define the time-related course of postmortem chest findings. Twelve cadavers (eight male, four female, 27-81 [mean, 60.0]years) were examined twice by PMCT within an interval of time (4-164 h [mean, 30.8; median, 17.5]). The pleural-space-fluid volume, pulmonary parenchyma volume, decreased aerated lung volume (DLV), %DLV (=DLV/pulmonary parenchyma volume) and chest cavity volume were compared between the first and second PMCT examinations. To evaluate the volume change rate, the rate of increase in pleural space fluid volume (mL/h) and the DLV rate (mL/h) were plotted according to the postmortem period. On the second PMCT, the volume of pleural space fluid (p=0.0469) and %DLV (p=0.0161) were significantly increased.

This method of infusion was employed to examine the direct effects of the fibers to the pleura. In the present study, 52- and 65-week experiments were employed to examine the long-term chronic effects after infusion of fiber-shaped TISMO into the thoracic cavities of A/J mice. Following this infusion, TISMO fibers were observed in the alveoli, indicating penetration through the visceral pleura. The additional histopathological detection of TISMO fibers in the liver, spleen, kidneys, ovary, heart, bone marrow, and brain of TISMO-infused mice indicated migration of the fibers out from the thoracic cavity. Atypical mesothelial cells with severe pleural proliferation were observed, but malignant mesotheliomas were not detected. This study demonstrated that intrathoracic infusion of TISMO fiber did not cause malignant mesothelioma but did cause severe chronic inflammation and proliferation of pleural mesothelial cells.",TISMO; TiO2; lung; mesothelioma; mouse; tumorigenesis.,Masanao Yokohira;Nozomi Hashimoto;Toshitaka Nakagawa;Yuko Nakano;Keiko Yamakawa;Sosuke Kishi;Shohei Kanie;Fumiko Ninomiya;Kousuke Saoo;Katsumi Imaida
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6340966/,The anterior junction anatomy,"It is useful to consider the anterior junction anatomy in terms of three components: the superior recesses, the line, and the inferior recesses. Each component localizes to a specific area retrosternally: the superior recesses--behind the manubrium; the line--behind the upper two thirds of the sternal body; and the inferior recesses--behind the lower third of the sternal body and below where the cardiac mass abuts the anterior chest wall. Since the anterior chest wall curves backward from bottom to top (Figure 61), the coronal plane of the superior recesses is behind that of the anterior junction line, the coronal plane of the inferior recesses being in front of that of the anterior junction line. Accordingly, then, anteroposterior conventional tomograms will usually demonstrate the inferior recesses on the most anterior levels, the line a centimeter or so behind the inferior recesses, the superior recesses a centimeter or so behind the line. Understanding the anterior junction anatomy in terms of three components has widespread use, as shown above, by many examples obtained from everyday film reading. The presence, absence, and location of disease may be diagnosed. As well, mistaken diagnoses may be avoided. Since the anterior junction lung relates to the anterior pleural space, pleural space processes may alter the anterior junction anatomy. It must be realized that although visualization of the normal anterior junction anatomy components may help to exclude the presence of retrosternal abnormality, they are not infallible. It is possible for a small lesion to be entirely contained within the anterior mediastinum and, thus, not alter the normal anterior junction components. A deep retrosternal space, where normally the anterior junction line is formed, may allow an anterior mediastinal mass to be present and a normal anterior junction line to be seen if the mass does not occupy the entire depth of the space. Furthermore, in patients with markedly hyperexpanded lungs, it is conceivable that the cardiac mass may abut the chest wall at the level of the inferior recesses to a lesser degree than usual, or not at all. Marked lung hyperexpansion may also conceivably cause the superior recesses to extend above the manubrium.",,A V Proto;J D Simmons;C J Zylak

When Aspergillus develops within a preformed cavity, however, these tests are likely to be negative. In this situation, classic imaging techniques such as chest X-ray and high resolution-computed tomography (HR-CT) can be of great diagnostic use. We here describe the case of a 62-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer and subsequent ablation of the left breast and radiotherapy. The case demonstrates an example of a pleuropulmonary aspergilloma, in which sero- and micro-biological detection failed. Thorax HR-CT exhibited the cavity, a small persistent pneumothorax, partially filled by an oval density. This density clearly dislocated according to gravity following a positional change of the patient from supine to prone. The density thus revealed mobility which was typical of aspergilloma. Following excision, this diagnosis was confirmed. A density within a cavity may be differentiated by its mobility from differential diagnoses such as lung cancer which would not be expected to exhibit mobility.",,Karsten Grosse Kreymborg;Hans-Jürgen Seyfarth;Christian Gessner;Alexander Schütz;Stefan Hammerschmidt;Ulrich Eichfeld;Gudrun Borte;Hubert Wirtz

In chronic anaemia, it is a physiological response to increased erythropoietin. In some other conditions, such as myeloid metaplasia, polycythaemia vera or chronic myeloid leukaemia, EH is due to a clonal disorder of haematopoiesis that enables progenitor cells to escape from the marrow and lodge in other organs. EH usually involves the liver, spleen and lymph nodes or it can be paravertebral, intrathoracic, pelvic. It is often asymptomatic but can sometimes lead to symptomatic tumour-like masses.

Twenty-eight patients had a chest tube and mediastinal drainage tube. Thirty-four patients had only a mediastinal drainage tube through the intercostal space. The remaining 30 patients had a single mediastinal drainage tube in the thoracic and abdominal cavity through the abdominal wall. The complication rates and pain scores for each of the groups were compared. The statistical calculations were performed using SPSS 17.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

Recent MRI studies have confirmed the presence of cardiac abnormalities in noncirrhotic PBC patients. However, cardiorespiratory consequences of these abnormalities have not been explored. Thoracic fluid content (TFC) is a noninvasive bioelectrical impedance measure of the electrical conductivity of the chest cavity. We explored TFC and its relationship with cardiac contractility parameters in early-stage PBC patients, compared with chronic liver disease and community controls. TFC was measured in early-stage PBC (noncirrhotic; n = 78), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (n = 23), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (n = 18) and in a community control population (n = 78). Myocardial contractility was measured as index of contractility, acceleration index, cardiac index, stroke index, left ventricular ejection time, and left ventricular work index. We also measured total arterial compliance and the Heather Index (HI; cardiac inotropy). The PBC group had significantly lower TFC compared with controls and the chronic liver disease groups (P < 0.0001). There was an association between increasing TFC and markers of cardiac function (cardiac index, stroke index, end-diastolic index, index of contractility, and acceleration index), together with indicators of cardiac inotropy and total arterial compliance. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the only parameter that independently associated with TFC was the marker of cardiac inotropy HI (P = 0.037; β 0.5).

However, reports on adverse effects of NM on ILCs and other components of the serosal immune system are scarce or even lacking. As ILCs are crucial in the first defense against pathogenic viruses and bacteria, it is possible that serosal exposure to NM may lead to a reduced resistance against pathogens.

Technical note,"Herniated thoracic discs, unlike their lumbar counterparts, are difficult to read and safely resect using traditional posterior approaches. Historically, the use of a laminectomy for thoracic disc resection has yielded poor clinical outcomes. Posterolateral and anterolateral approaches have become the standard surgical means of treating these lesions. The traditional anterolateral approach, the transpleural thoracotomy, is an extensive procedure that requires direct retraction of the lung, a deep surgical field, and postoperative closed-chest drainage. An alternative to this anterior approach, the retropleural thoracotomy, is described here. This approach provides the shortest direct route to the thoracic spine and leaves the pleura intact. A smaller incision and less retraction than traditional approaches may reduce postoperative pain and pulmonary-related complications.

Fifty-two patients who had accumulated a medium or large volume of tuberculous thoracic fluid, fluid being bound by fibre tissues and a pleura thickened more than 2 mm were divided randomly into two groups. All patients were all given standard treatments with antituberculous drugs. The HAbg was injected into the thoracic cavity in the treatment group (n = 27 patients), whereas normal saline was introduced into the thoracic cavity in the control group (n = 25 patients). Before and after HAbg injection, routine thoracic fluid examinations (including qualitative protein analysis, cell counts and classification of cell types) and protein quantification were performed. A chest radiograph and B-ultrasound were performed and pulmonary function was tested after 2 weeks and 3 months of thoracic fluid absorption. 3. The results show that patients who were treated with the HAbg had a significantly thinner pleura, a lower protein concentration and white blood cell count in the thoracic fluid and a higher forced expiratory volume in 1 s and forced vital capacity compared with patients in the control group. 4.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18089615/,Perforation of the ascending aorta with a hematoma extending into the left-side upper extrapleural cavity,We herein present an extremely rare case of a perforation of the ascending aorta with a hematoma extending into the left-side upper extrapleural cavity. A 62-year-old male with a sudden onset of severe chest pain was referred to our institution because of an abnormal shadow in the left-side upper lung field. Computed tomography revealed a small fusiform aortic arch aneurysm and a hematoma extending to the left-side upper extrapleural cavity. We diagnosed the patient to have acute aortic syndrome and urgent surgery was thus performed. Major bleeding which might be caused by a progression of the perforation was seen during a dissection of the aorta. The aortic arch was transected and a total arch replacement was performed with a 26 mm Dacron graft. No findings of a rupture of the aortic arch aneurysm or dissection were observed. The histopathology of the aorta revealed a severe atheromatous lesion with calcification and thinning disarrayed elastic fibers. The postoperative course was essentially good except for the development of pericardial effusion which required drainage.,,Takayuki Kadohama;Nobuyuki Akasaka;Kazutomo Goh;Tadahiro Sasajima

These hernias can be acquired or congenital and occur in varying locations. Acquired thoracic hernias typically develop after surgery or trauma. The most common form is intercostal herniation due to thoracotomy. Trans-mediastinal herniation of the lung is even less common, typically seen in patients with sequestration, scimitar syndrome, or pneumonectomy, and, when present, commonly occurs across the anterior mediastinum.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3662180/,Comparison of gastric lavage and thoracic cavity lavage in the treatment of severe hypothermia in dogs,"A study was undertaken to compare warm gastric (Group 1) and closed thoracic cavity (Group 2) lavage for rewarming severely hypothermic dogs. Adult mongrel dogs were monitored by intra-arterial catheter, central venous catheter, and ECG, and by central venous, esophageal, and rectal temperature probes. Animals were externally cooled to an average of 21.2 C using ice bags. Eight Group 1 and eight Group 2 animals underwent continuous warm saline gastric or closed thoracic cavity lavage, respectively, using afferent and efferent nasogastric and thoracostomy tubes. No animal suffered ventricular fibrillation during tube placement. The closed lavage system consisted of a high-efficiency heat exchanger, a roller pump infusion device, and a heat exchange fluid bath. The lavage fluid circulated at a flow rate of 550 mL/min and a temperature of 39 C. Thoracic lavage animals were followed clinically for 24 hours for evidence of complications, then euthanized and autopsied. The mean time required to rewarm the animals 10 C by central venous temperature probe was 210.9 +/- 18.6 minutes for the gastric group and 99.3 +/- 23.0 minutes for the thoracic group (P less than .001). Rectal temperature consistently lagged behind central venous temperature during both the cooling and rewarming phases in both treatment groups. All of the thoracic lavage animals made an uneventful recovery. Continuous warm saline thoracic cavity lavage for core rewarming of severely hypothermic dogs is more effective than gastric lavage, and appears to be safe.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,D D Brunette;S Sterner;E P Robinson;E Ruiz

It has not been thoroughly investigated which automated segmentation-corrected segmentation similarity metrics best predict clinician correction time. Bilateral thoracic cavity volumes in 329 CT scans were segmented by a UNet-inspired deep learning segmentation tool and subsequently corrected by a fourth-year medical student. Eight spatial similarity metrics were calculated between the automated and corrected segmentations and associated with correction times using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Nine clinical variables were also associated with metrics and correction times using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients or Mann-Whitney U tests. The added path length, false negative path length, and surface Dice similarity coefficient correlated better with correction time than traditional metrics, including the popular volumetric Dice similarity coefficient (respectively ρ = 0.69, ρ = 0.65, ρ = - 0.48 versus ρ = - 0.25; correlation p values < 0.001). Clinical variables poorly represented in the autosegmentation tool's training data were often associated with decreased accuracy but not necessarily with prolonged correction time. Metrics used to develop and evaluate autosegmentation tools should correlate with clinical time saved. To our knowledge, this is only the second investigation of which metrics correlate with time saved. Validation of our findings is indicated in other anatomic sites and clinical workflows. Novel spatial similarity metrics may be preferable to traditional metrics for developing and evaluating autosegmentation tools that are intended to save clinicians time.",Image segmentation; “AI artificial intelligence” [MeSH]; “Clinical informatics” [MeSH]; “Computer-assisted image analysis” [MeSH]; “Medical imaging” [MeSH].,Kendall J Kiser;Arko Barman;Sonja Stieb;Clifton D Fuller;Luca Giancardo

Detailed analysis of the uptake, transport, and clearance processes of the polymeric nanoagent revealed a clearance time constant of ∼30 min and an apparent clearance efficiency of 80% to 90% for the nanoagent in both axial and lateral TVs. TPE-TR imaging of the dissected internal organs proved that the liver is mainly responsible for the sequestration of the nanoagent, which is consistent with the apparent retention efficiency of liver, ∼32 % , as determined by the real-time in vivo TV imaging.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17205294/,Pleural macrophages are the dominant cell population in the thoracic cavity with an inflammatory cytokine profile similar to peritoneal macrophages,"Numerous human macrophage (mphi) subpopulations with different behavior have been identified in adults. It is well known that peritoneal mphi are activated by abdominal surgery and subsequently contribute to a systemic inflammatory response that leads to immune suppression, increased morbidity and mortality. Information on the role of pleural mphi in adults is scarce and information on their role in children is lacking. We investigated the behavior of pleural versus peritoneal mphi in children and adolescents. As a first step, we compared the cellular composition of the pleural and peritoneal surface in children and adolescents. Pleural and peritoneal lavages were performed in 21 patients undergoing non-contaminated laparoscopic and thoracoscopic surgical procedures. We observed a significantly higher percentage of mphi in the pleural compared to the peritoneal cavity with less lymphocytes, a small amount of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and other cells. To further study the mphi inflammatory response, we measured the spontaneous and LPS triggered cytokine release of isolated pleural versus peritoneal mphi (IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10). The pattern of cytokine release was similar in both, pleural and peritoneal mphi. Directly after lavage, they showed a strong activation, with no difference between stimulated and non-stimulated cells. After 24 h resting, mphi of both compartments reacted to LPS with a similar significant increase in the cytokine release. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that pleural mphi represent the dominant cell population in the pleural cavity of the young. They show a similar inflammatory response as peritoneal mphi and should be considered to play a major role in the local inflammatory response to thoracic surgery.",,Akihiro Shimotakahara;Joachim F Kuebler;Gertrud Vieten;Martin L Metzelder;Claus Petersen;Benno M Ure

These techniques are needed to develop a mechanism to study the molecular pathogenesis of M. gallisepticum. Tn916 has the ability to transpose into the M. gallisepticum genome by both transformation and conjugation. In this study, PEG-mediated transformation was employed for the transfer of Tn916 into M. gallisepticum and create a transposon mutant library. Transformants were obtained at a frequency of approximately 5 x 10(-8) per recipient CFU. A total of 424 MG/Tn916 mutants were constructed and sequence data from the transposon junctions of 71 mutants was obtained and used to identify transposon insertion sites. Insertions were found throughout the genome in nearly all of the major gene categories, making this the first extensive characterization of a transposon mutant library of M. gallisepticum. Transposon stability was also examined, and it was determined that for two mutants the element was stably maintained in vivo in the absence of selective pressure.",,Patricia L Whetzel;Linda L Hnatow;Calvin L Keeler Jr;John E Dohms

A 67-year-old woman exhibiting a slowly-expanding intrathoracic mass, as revealed by a chest radiograph, was admitted to our hospital. The patient had undergone a pneumonectomy 37 years earlier during treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis. Computed tomography revealed a huge mass in her right hemithorax. The differential diagnosis of this mass included chronic empyema combined with a malignancy, such as lymphoma or a soft tissue sarcoma. The tumor, which was classified as an encapsulated chronic hematoma, was removed surgically. Samples sent for histopathological and microbiological analysis revealed no evidence of neoplasia or infection. The patient was finally diagnosed with a chronic expanding hematoma of the thorax.

There is a paucity of evidence to determine whether this is a consistent finding in children. Eighty-seven computed tomography scans of the thorax acquired at local children's hospitals from April 2010 to September 2011 were retrospectively collected. The distance between the SVC-RA junction and the AV was measured by dual consensus. The cranio-caudal level of the junction and the AV were referenced to the costal cartilages (CCs) and anterior intercostal spaces (ICSs). The results confirmed that the SVC-RA junction has a variable relationship to the AV. The junction was on average 3.1 mm superior to the AV. This distance increased with age. In the <1-year-old age group, the junction was on average 1.3 mm superior to the AV (range: -6 to 11 mm). In the 1-2 years old age group: 3.5 mm (range: -8 to 15 mm). In the 3-6 years old: 3.8 mm (range: -9 to 13 mm). In the >7 years old age group: 4 mm (range: -11 to 16 mm). The surface anatomy of the SVC-RA junction was variable, ranging from the second ICS to sixth CC. The SVC-RA junction has a predictable relationship to the AV, and this can be used as an adjunct marker for accurate placement of central venous catheters except in the smallest neonates. Clin.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30157470/,A Novel Method for Quantifying Total Thoracic Tumor Burden in Mice,"Mouse models are powerful tools to study lung cancer initiation and progression in vivo and have contributed significantly to recent advances in therapy. Using micro-computed tomography to monitor and study parenchymal and extra-parenchymal metastases in existing murine models of lung cancer is challenging owing to a lack of radiographic contrast and difficulty in achieving respiratory gating. To facilitate the analysis of these in vivo imaging studies and study of tumor progression in murine models we developed a novel, rapid, semi-automated method of calculating thoracic tumor burden from computed tomography images. This method, in which commercially available software is used to calculate the mass of the thoracic cavity (MTC), takes into account the aggregate tumor burden in the thoracic cavity. The present study showed that in tumor-free mice, the MTC does not change over time and is not affected by breathing, whereas in tumor-bearing mice, the increase in the MTC is a measure of tumor mass that correlates well with tumor burden measured by lung weight. Tumor burden calculated with our MTC method correlated with that measured by lung weight as well as or better than that calculated using four established methods. To test this method, we assessed metastatic tumor development and response to a pharmacologic PLK1 inhibitor in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model. PLK1 inhibition significantly inhibited tumor growth. Our results demonstrate that the MTC method can be used to study dynamic changes in tumor growth and response to therapeutics in genetically engineered mouse models and orthotopic xenograft mouse models of lung cancer.",,Pavitra Viswanath;Shaohua Peng;Ratnakar Singh;Charles Kingsley;Peter A Balter;Faye M Johnson

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29338903/,Clinical workflow optimization to improve 4DCT reconstruction for Toshiba Aquilion CT scanners,"Respiratory motion remains a source of major uncertainties in radiotherapy. Respiratory correlated computed tomography (referred to as 4DCT) serves as one way of reducing breathing artifacts in 3D-CTs and allows the investigation of tumor motion over time. The quality of the 4DCT images depends on the data acquisition scheme, which in turn is dependent on the vendor. Specifically, the only way Toshiba Aquilion LB CT scanners can reconstruct 4DCTs is a cycle-based reconstruction using triggers provided by an external surrogate signal. The accuracy is strongly dependent on the method of trigger generation. Two consecutive triggers are used to define a breathing cycle which is divided into respiratory phases of equal duration. The goal of this study is to identify if there are advantages in the usage of local-amplitude based sorting (LAS) of the respiration motion states, in order to reduce image artifacts and improve 4DCT quality. Furthermore, this study addresses the generation and optimization of a clinical workflow using as surrogate motion monitoring system the Sentinel™ (C-RAD AB, Sweden) optical surface scanner in combination with a Toshiba Aquilion LB CT scanner. For that purpose, a phantom study using 10 different breathing waveforms and a retrospective patient study using the 4DCT reconstructions of 10 different patients has been conducted. The error in tumor volume has been reduced from 2.9±3.7% to 2.7±2.6% using optimal cycle-based triggers (manipulated CBS) and to 2.7±2.2% using LAS in the phantom study. Moreover, it was possible to decrease the tumor volume variability from 5.0±3.6% using the original cycle-based triggers (original CBS) to 3.5±2.5% using the optimal triggers and to 3.7±2.7% using LAS in the patient data analysis. We therefore propose the usage of the manipulated CBS, also with regard to an accurate and safe clinical workflow.",4DCT; Local amplitude-based sorting; Optical laser surface scanner; Radiotherapy; Respiratory motion monitoring.,Philipp Freislederer;Christian Heinz;Henrike von Zimmermann;Sabine Gerum;Falk Roeder;Michael Reiner;Matthias Söhn;Claus Belka;Katia Parodi

The general objective of this work was to describe its heart anatomy. We dissected six adult animals and five neonates. The heart of the alpaca was located in the middle mediastinum, with a craniocaudal extension from the third to the sixth rib. No ligament that connected the fibrous pericardium to the sternum or to the diaphragm was detected. In the right atrium, there was a developed crista terminalis and small pectinate muscles. In the right ventricle, the septomarginal trabecula was very large. From the proximities of the interventricular septum arose small septomarginal trabeculae that ended in carnous trabeculae of the septal wall. The left atrium included little developed pectinate muscles. On the left ventricle, both papillary muscles were bilobed. Two left septomarginal trabeculas were detected in this ventricle. The left subclavian artery was originated from the aortic arch separately from the brachiocephalic trunk, and bicarotid trunk was present. The other branches of the subclavian artery were similar to the domestic ruminants. The arterial supply of the heart was of the right type.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18357458/,Left displacement of the mediastinum determines the imbalance in the pulmonary vascular bed and lung volume in children with pectus excavatum,"The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of morphologic alteration on lung function in children with pectus excavatum (PE) and to establish the usefulness of chest radiography to predict the imbalance of pulmonary perfusion and lung volume. Chest radiography, pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy, and computed tomography (CT) for calculation of each lung volume were performed in 38 children with PE. To assess the relationship between position change of the mediastinum and lung, the following indices were calculated: (1) vertebral index (VI); the severity of sternal depression on the lateral chest radiograph, (2) left displacement index (LDI); the ratio between the left border of the mediastinum and the left border of the thorax to the transverse thoracic dimension on posterioanterior chest radiography; (3) left-to-right count ratio for the lung scintigraphy (Ls/Rs), and (4) the left-to-right thorax volume ratio from the CT scan (Lv/Rv). Compared to children without PE, VI was significantly higher, and LDI was lower in patients with PE. Pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy and CT showed that left pulmonary perfusion and lung volume were significantly lower than in the right lung in PE. LDI showed a close correlation with Ls/Rs (R = 0.443, P = 0.005) and Lv/Rv (R = 0.703, P < 0.001). Left displacement of the mediastinum within the closed thoracic cavity directly imposes constraints on the left lung, resulting in reductions of perfusion and lung volume that likely determine the physiologic severity of lung function in PE. Posterioanterior chest radiography might be useful in predicting the severity of PE.",,Shinya Shimoyama;Tohru Kobayashi;Yoshinari Inoue;Hiroyuki Mochizuki;Akito Hamajima;Tomio Kobayashi;Shinitsu Hatakeyama;Akihiro Morikawa

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20051047/,Surgery should be the first line of treatment for empyema,"Few thoracic conditions present such considerable challenges as pleural space infections, herein termed 'empyema' as a general term. Patients may present with free-flowing infected pleural effusions that readily drain by catheter or, at the other extreme, with organized intrapleural collections of pus with thick pleural peels that require open decortication. In the transition from a simple to complex empyema, patients pass through the intermediary, or 'fibrinopurulent' stage. Such patients require careful assessment to determine the ideal management approach. Although existing trials provide insufficient evidence to standardize drainage approaches, an accepted principle directs clinicians to drain empyemas promptly and completely. In this pro-con presentation, two recognized experts on empyema--a thoracic surgeon and an interventional radiologist-approach management from decidedly opposite perspectives. The surgeon prefers video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery as primary therapy for fibrinopurulent empyemas. The radiologist counters that imaging-guided, small-bore catheters, sometimes with adjunctive fibrinolytic drugs, provide effective therapy for select patients. In the absence of high-quality data to settle this debate, both experts present reasoned and thoughtful approaches, which produce superior clinical outcomes in their own institutions. So readers should recognize that controversy exists in empyema management and carefully review each expert's comments. Within each are essential elements of care that can be integrated into a multidisciplinary approach. Readers may conclude from this debate that each institution should develop a collaborative model for managing empyemas that integrates differing expertise to customize care for individual patients and continuously measure and improve their patients' outcomes.",,Ioannis E Petrakis;John E Heffner;Jeffrey S Klein

Several authors have described different approaches - with different degrees of invasiveness - to this anatomical area. We used the transmanubrial osteomuscular sparing approach described by Grünenwald and Spaggiari for six patients with five different indications: 1) left anterior Pancoast tumor; 2) glomus tumor originating from the inferior trunk (C8-T1 roots) of the right brachial plexus; 3) T1 vertebral tumor; 4) right internal jugular chain, Pirogoff confluence and subclavian artery metastatic lymph nodes from thyroid carcinoma; 5) chondrosarcoma of the first left rib. The results have been satisfactory from a surgical point of view, considering that the approach gave a good exposure of the operative field (especially at the cervical level), without cosmetic problems or functional limitations. In our experience, the transmanubrial osteomuscular sparing approach is a valid technique for the treatment of several kinds of tumors of the cervico-thoracic inlet, giving a good exposure of the operative field.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20179136/,Cervical incision thoracic endoscopic surgery: a minimally invasive endoscopic approach in thoracic surgery,"Cervical incision thoracic surgery has recently been described. Currently, there is a move to increase the role of flexible endoscopy in surgery. The use of a flexible endoscope through a natural orifice into the thoracic cavity still remains ethically doubtful. The authors present a surgical experimental study using a flexible endoscope through a cervical incision for the exploration of both the mediastinum and the thoracic cavity in a cadaver. An experimental work on 10 refrigerated and non-embalmed cadavers was initiated. We used a unique device - a standard double-channel flexible video gastroscope. Through a small cervical incision, we performed simultaneous exploration of the mediastinum and both pleural cavities. Identification and biopsies of mediastinal lymph nodes at levels 2R, 4R, 7 and 4L were easy to perform in all subjects. In eight cadavers, we performed an assessment of bilateral pleural cavities and multiple pleural biopsies as well as bilateral thoracic sympathectomy. A chest tube was placed in the thoracic cavity at the end of all pleural procedures. The potential advantages of this approach are simultaneous exploration of the mediastinum and pleura and the performance of several thoracic interventions through a small cervical incision. The flexible endoscope could become a surgical tool for thoracic surgery.",,Jalal Assouad;Camille Steltzlen;Hichem Masmoudi;Stephane Vignes;Valerie Gounant;Vincent Delmas;Dominique Grunenwald

It can originate from a different thoracic structures (for example: lung parenchyma, mediastinum, pleura) or thoracic wall. We present a case of a 35-year-old woman with a giant tumour of the left hemithorax, who had two weeks history of non-productive cough and progressive dyspnoea from eight months. Chest radiography showed a large, round opacity in the left hemithorax, which displaced the cardiac silhouette to the right. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a huge, heterogeneous, well-circumscribed mass in the left pleural cavity. The tumour expanded locally towards the thoracic wall and left lung, and displaced mediastinal structures to the right. There was no lymphadenopathy on the physical examination and CT scan. Abdominal ultrasonography was normal. There was no proof of tumour in the extremities and trunk. The patient underwent surgical excision of the tumour via thoracotomy, but because of tumour infiltration, part of the third rib and surrounding wall were resected. There was no evidence of lung and mediastinum involvement. The mass measured 17.5 × 18 × 10 cm and weighed 1690 g. A final diagnosis of a well-differentiated liposarcoma - sclerosing subtype - was established after histological and immunohistochemical staining. In our opinion, the liposarcoma in this case originated from the chest wall. Surgical resection was the only treatment.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25894572/,The utility of thoracic ultrasound in patients with acute eosinophilic pneumonia,"Thoracic ultrasound (TUS) is an easy-to-use imaging modality that aids physicians in the differential diagnosis of respiratory diseases. However, no data exist on the TUS findings of acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) or their clinical utility in patients with AEP. Thus, we performed an observational study on TUS findings and their clinical utility for follow-up in patients with AEP. We prospectively screened patients who visited the emergency department for acute respiratory symptoms at the Armed Forces Capital Hospital in South Korea between February 2014 and July 2014. Of them, patients suspected to have AEP underwent an etiological investigation, including flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and TUS, and we evaluated TUS findings and serial changes on TUS during the treatment course compared with those from chest radiographs. In total, 22 patients with AEP were identified. The TUS examinations revealed that all patients exhibited multiple diffuse bilateral B-lines and lung sliding, with (n = 5) or without pleural effusion, which was consistent with alveolar-interstitial syndrome. B-line numbers fell during the course of treatment, as the lines became thinner and fainter. A-lines were evident in 19 patients on day 7 of hospitalization, when B-lines had disappeared in 13 patients, and all pleural effusion had resolved. All patients exhibited complete ultrasonic resolution by day 14, along with clinicoradiological improvement. Chest radiographs of five patients taken on day 7 seemed to show complete resolution, but several abnormal B-lines were evident on TUS performed the same day. As a result, our data show common TUS findings of AEP and suggest that AEP may be included as a differential diagnosis when multiple diffuse bilateral B-lines with preserved lung sliding are identified on a TUS examination in patients with acute symptoms, and that TUS is a useful modality for evaluating the treatment response in patients with AEP.",,Hee Yoon;Se Jin Kim;Kang Kim;Ji Eun Lee;Byung Woo Jhun

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27862613/,Naso-esophageal extraluminal drainage for postoperative anastomotic leak after thoracic esophagectomy for patients with esophageal cancer,"Postoperative anastomotic leaks and subsequent mediastinal abscess are serious complications. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of naso-esophageal extraluminal drainage after thoracic esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction using a posterior mediastinal route. About 50 of 365 patients (13.7%) with esophageal cancer and postoperative anastomotic leak after curative esophagectomy was investigated. Beginning in June 2009, naso-esophageal extraluminal drainage by inserting a naso-esophageal aspiration tube into the abscess cavity when percutaneous abscess drainage was introduced which was ineffective or technically impossible. Twenty-five patients underwent naso-esophageal extraluminal drainage concomitantly with enteral nutrition. Twenty-one (84%) patients had major leaks, one (4%) minor leak and three (12%) had endoscopically proven conduit necrosis. None of the naso-esophageal extraluminal drainage cases (100%) required reintervention or reoperation and all experienced complete cure (100%) during hospitalization. Endoscopic balloon dilatation was performed for four patients after discharge because of anastomotic stricture. Patients with leaks were divided into two groups: current group (n = 32), treated after June 2009, and preceding group (n = 18), treated prior to the introduction of naso-esophageal extraluminal drainage. Significantly more patients in the preceding group suffered respiratory failure (28% vs. 61%, p = 0.024), and higher reoperation rate (0% vs. 17%, p = 0.042) and hospital mortality (0% vs. 22%, p = 0.013). In the current group, 31 (97%) patients experienced complete cure during hospitalization. Naso-esophageal extraluminal drainage and concomitant enteral nutritional support are less invasive, and effective and powerful methods to treat even major leakage after esophagectomy.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29753503/,Novel esophageal reconstruction technique via transmediastinal route from posterior to anterior mediastinum after esophagectomy,"Background: The incidence of metachronous esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) after head and neck cancer (HNC) and in elderly patients has increased. Both elderly ESCC patients and ESCC patients after HNC surgery are at potential risk for dysphagia, and for the latter, surgery in the neck is difficult. An intrathoracic anastomosis that bypasses the cervical procedure is preferable to preserve swallowing function and reduce surgical risk. In gastrectomized patients, because the stomach cannot be used as a substitute, securing graft blood supply is critical, but microvascular anastomosis cannot be easily added in procedures for intrathoracic posterior mediastinal reconstruction. Thus, we have developed a novel technique for esophageal reconstruction in gastrectomized patients who are elderly or who had undergone HNC surgery, enabling concomitant intrathoracic anastomosis and microvascular anastomosis.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28616692/,A minimally-invasive method for profiling volatile organic compounds within postmortem internal gas reservoirs,"In forensic casework, non-invasive and minimally-invasive methods for postmortem examinations are extremely valuable. Whole body postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) is often used to provide visualization of the internal characteristics of a body prior to more invasive procedures and has also been used to locate gas reservoirs inside the body to assist in determining cause of death. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that exploiting the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) located in these gas reservoirs by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC-HRTOF-MS) may assist in providing information regarding the postmortem interval. The aim of the current study was to further develop the procedures related to solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and GC×GC-HRTOF-MS analysis of gas reservoirs collected from deceased individuals. SPME fiber extraction parameters, internal standard approach, and sample stability were investigated. Altering the SPME parameters increased the selectivity and sensitivity for the VOC profile, and the use of a mixed deuterated internal standard contributed to data quality. Samples were found to be stable up to 6 weeks but were recommended to be analyzed within 4 weeks due to higher variation observed beyond this point. In addition, 29 VOC markers of interest were identified, and heart and/or abdominal cavity samples were suggested as a possible standardized sampling location for future studies. The data presented in this study will contribute to the long-term goal of producing a routine, accredited method for minimally-invasive VOC analysis in postmortem examinations.",Cadaver decomposition; Forensic science; GCxGC; HRTOFMS; Postmortem interval; Volatile organic compounds.,Katelynn A Perrault;Pierre-Hugues Stefanuto;Lena M Dubois;Vincent Varlet;Silke Grabherr;Jean-François Focant

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19753645/,The pattern of the thoracic splanchnic nerves as they pass through the diaphragm,"The formation and structure of the greater, lesser, and least thoracic splanchnic nerves is highly variable in their intrathoracic as well as their subdiaphragmatic portion. Splanchnicectomies for pain control of otherwise intractable upper abdominal pain and other surgical procedures are dependent on the detailed knowledge of the anatomy of these nerves and their variations. Many commonly used anatomical illustrations depict the passage of the thoracic splanchnic nerves through the diaphragm uniformly as three nerves penetrating the crura in three separate locations along a rough superoinferior line. As this pattern does not correspond with our own sporadic observations, we performed a series of dissections to study the exact anatomy of this area. Dissections of 24 donors revealed that the most common pattern of diaphragmatic passage of these three nerves is through a single location in each crus. From this crural passageway, the three nerves then diverge to reach their targets, with the greater thoracic splanchnic nerve bending anteriorly at nearly 90 degrees to enter the posterolateral edge of the celiac ganglion.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18399990/,Attempts to revive Mycobacterium tuberculosis from 300-year-old human mummies,"Environmental persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is subject to speculation. However, the reality that infected postmortem tissues can be a danger to pathologists and embalmers has worrisome implications. A few experimental studies have demonstrated the organism's ability to withstand exposure to embalming fluid and formalin. Recently, a failure was reported in an attempt to resuscitate an original isolate of Robert Koch to determine the lifetime of the tubercle bacillus. The present study also considers a historical approach to determine persistence under favorable environmental conditions. It asks whether acid-fast forms observed in tissues of 300-year-old Hungarian mummies can be resuscitated. Finding organisms before the advent of antibiotics and pasteurization may yield valuable genetic information. Using various media modifications, as well as guinea pig inoculation, an attempt was made to culture these tissues for M. tuberculosis.

Her general condition was getting progressively worse. Chest X-ray demonstrated a left sided hemopneumothorax caused by a fractured rib. Thoracic drainage was planned, but the tube introduced on the usual place into the left thoracic cavity perforated the stomach which was incarcerated in the chest. After this an urgent operation was carried out. We found an incarcerated, twisted stomach prolapsing through a rupture of the diaphragm. It was partially necrotic. Excision of the stomach wall with suturing the diaphragm, lavage and drainage of the thoracic and abdominal cavity was carried out. Despite the operation multi-organ failure developed as a result of sepsis, and the patient'died. We discuss the literature in connection with the presentation of this rare and interesting case.

The diagnosis of myoepithelioma is based on the presence of histological and immunohistochemical characteristics of myoepithelioma, but in unusual locations, the diagnosis is challenging. For such cases, cytogenetic approaches have been developed as helpful tools for the diagnosis. We report a surgical case of 51-year-old woman with myoepithelioma occurring in the posterior mediastinum that harbored the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region1 (EWSR1) gene rearrangement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a myoepithelioma occurring in the posterior mediastinum. In this case, the patient underwent the thoracoscopic surgery for a diagnostic tumorectomy and was diagnosed as myoepithelioma based on the following immunohistological findings.

We cut 3 cadavers transversely and another 3 vertically to observe the anatomy of thoracic-abdominal junctional zone. We scanned 69 patients with diseases in right thoracic-abdominal junctional zone by MDCT. The correlation between MDCT features of right thoracic-abdominal junctional region and the anatomic-pathology in this region was evaluated. We found results as that in cadaver sections, the right pulmonary ligament, which was below inferior pulmonary vein, attached the inferior lobe of right lung to the esophagus, that the coronary ligament, which interiorly extended from falciform ligament and laterally formed into right triangular ligament, contained two layers, and that the bare area of liver, which positioned between the two layers of coronary ligament, was directly next to diaphragm with no peritoneum covered. There were 50 cases with both pleural and ascitic fluid, while the pleural fluid was divided into anterior and posterior compartments by the right pulmonary ligament, whereas the ascitic fluid was limited in perihepatic space in majority. Among the 50 cases, 5 patients had lung cancer with diaphragmatic pleura, diaphragm and upper abdomen involved. 5 patients had right hepatic lobe cancer with subdiaphragmatic peritoneum, crura diaphragmatis and lower thoracic cavity involved. 1 patient had right adrenal carcinoma with phrenic metastasis. 8 patients had inflammation in right lower thorax and/or right upper abdomen. The spreads of these diseases include mainly direct invasion, blood and lymphatic spread routs in the region. Conclusion could be drawn that the MDCT features and distribution of right thoracic-abdominal junctional region diseases correlate with the anatomical characteristics in this region.",,Yilan Ye;Zhigang Yang;Hua Li;Wen Deng;Yuan Li;Yingkun Guo

We isolated a gene encoding chick DDAH1. In situ hybridization analysis revealed characteristic DDAH1 mRNA expression in the embryonic spinal cord, which was especially strong in the ventral horn and dorsal root ganglion (DRG). DDAH1 was also detected in the brain, kidney, digestive tract, and in other tissues. We examined the expression pattern of DDAH1 in developing rats and compared this with the expression pattern in chicks. The expression pattern in the rats was very similar to that in the chicks, but there were some differences between the chicks and rats in the amount of DDAH1 detected in the heart, liver, lung, and DRG. We also investigated neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) mRNA expression patterns in rat embryos. The DDAH1 expression patterns were completely different from nNOS expression patterns.

During exercise, there were only small changes in Ch and Ab circumference and no increase with increasing tidal volume. At rest, walk and trot, the flow, Ch and Ab signals were in phase. However, during canter and gallop, the Ch and Ab changes were 180 degrees out of phase with each other and both were out of phase with airflow. In contrast to exercise, increase in ventilation at rest achieved by administration of lobeline resulted in a 4-6-fold increase in tidal volume; large excursions of the chest were always in phase with airflow. Furthermore, 3 horses showed an increase in chest circumference, demonstrating that chest stiffness per se does not preclude chest circumferential expansion. In conclusion, in the absence of significant increases in either Ch or Ab expansion during running, elongation of the thoracoabdominal segment may be the main determinant of tidal volume.",,D J Marlin;R C Schrotert;P M M Cashman;C M Deaton;D C Poole;C A Kindig;P McDonough;H H Erickson

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20077515/,Lung size and thoracic morphology in shallow- and deep-diving cetaceans,"Shallow-diving, coastal bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and deep-diving, pelagic pygmy and dwarf sperm whales (Kogia breviceps and K. sima) will experience vastly different ambient pressures at depth, which will influence the volume of air within their lungs and potentially the degree of thoracic collapse they experience. This study tested the hypotheses that lung size will be reduced and/or thoracic mobility will be enhanced in deeper divers. Lung mass (T. truncatus, n = 106; kogiids, n = 18) and lung volume (T. truncatus, n = 5; kogiids, n = 4), relative to total body mass, were compared. One T. truncatus and one K. sima were cross-sectioned to calculate lung, thoracic vasculature, and other organ volumes. Excised thoraxes (T. truncatus, n = 3; kogiids, n = 4) were mechanically manipulated to compare changes in thoracic cavity shape and volume. Kogiid lungs were half the mass and one-fifth the volume of those of similarly sized T. truncatus. The lungs occupied only 15% of the total thoracic cavity volume in K. sima and 37% in T. truncatus. The kogiid and dolphin thoraxes underwent similar changes in shape and volume, although the width of the thoracic inlet was relatively constrained in kogiids. A broader phylogenetic comparison demonstrated that the ratio of lung mass to total body mass in kogiids, physeterids, and ziphiids was similar to that of terrestrial mammals, while delphinids and phocoenids possessed relatively large lungs. Thus, small lung size in deep-diving odontocetes may be a plesiomorphic character. The relatively large lung size of delphinids and phocoenids appears to be a derived condition that may permit the lung to function as a site of respiratory gas exchange throughout a dive in these rapid breathing, short-duration, shallow divers.",,Marina A Piscitelli;William A McLellan;Sentiel A Rommel;James E Blum;Susan G Barco;D Ann Pabst

The thoracic ducts were dissected from nine formaldehyde-preserved male cadavers. The drainage patterns, diameter of the thoracic duct in upper, middle and lower thoracic segments, localization of main tributaries and morphologic features of cisterna chyli were determined. The thoracic duct was detected in all cadavers. The main tributaries were concentrated at upper thoracic (between third and fifth thoracic vertebrae) and lower thoracic segments (below the level of ninth thoracic vertebra) at the right side. However, the main lymphatic tributaries were drained into the thoracic duct only in the lower thoracic area (below the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra) at the left side. Two major anatomic variations were detected in the thoracic duct. In the first case, there were two different lymphatic drainage systems. In the second case, the thoracic duct was found as bifid at two different levels. In formaldehyde preservation, the dimensions of the soft tissues may change. For that reason, the dimensions were not discussed and they may not be a guide in surgery. Additionally, our study group is quite small. Larger series may be needed to define the anatomic variations.

The study included 43 multiparous, morbidly obese women (mean body mass index, 35.8 kg/m2) with a mean age (+/- SD) of 38.6 +/- 7 years. All had full abdominoplasty and repair of the musculoaponeurotic system during the period from June of 1999 to May of 2002. Forty-three morbidly obese multiparous patients were seen over a period of 24 months. Their intraabdominal pressure was estimated by measuring the intravesical pressure before and after repair of severe diastases (divarication) of the rectus abdominis muscles with severely flaccid myofascial component before using a hydrometer connected to a Foley catheter both before and after repair. All patients had pulmonary function checked before and 2 months after the repair. The study confirmed that there are minimal changes on the intraabdominal pressure parameters compared with measurement before and after full abdominoplasty with plication of the rectus muscles, with minimal to negligible changes in the intrathoracic pressure. These changes are clinically and statistically significant (p < 0.0001).

A subsequent study using eggs of genotype G1 from humans and G3 from pigs to infect pigs and mice indicated that there is a significant difference in the ability to infect and establish as larvae in mice and as adults in pigs between the two genotypes. Extending previous investigations, the present study investigated whether there are differences in development as designated by egg hatching, larvae migration and distribution in the mice between the Ascaris strains with known genotypes. Ascaris eggs of genotypes G1 (predominating in human-derived worms) and G3 (predominating in pig-derived worms) were used to infect C57BL/6 mice orally. Eggs/larvae were examined from the small and large intestines, thoracic and abdominal cavities, peripheral blood, livers and lungs at intervals of 2h until 12h post-infection, then periodically until 34 days of infection. Results showed distinct differences in egg hatching (the timing and location of hatching, and the numbers hatched), and in larvae migration and distribution (the means and constituent ratios, the time of peak recovery, and larvae reappearing in intestines) between the two strains. The results can explain the findings of significantly higher larval recovery of genotype G1 than G3 in the mice, and may shed some enlightenment to understand the difference in host affiliation of Ascaris of different genotypes.",,Weidong Peng;Keng Yuan;Guohua Peng;Lin Qiu;Zhifang Dai;Fang Yuan;Yinying Hu;Ningyan Hu

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28935164/,Elevated expression of neuropeptide signaling genes in the eyestalk ganglia and Y-organ of Gecarcinus lateralis individuals that are refractory to molt induction,"Molting is induced in decapod crustaceans via multiple leg autotomy (MLA) or eyestalk ablation (ESA). MLA removes five or more walking legs, which are regenerated and become functional appendages at ecdysis. ESA eliminates the primary source of molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) and crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH), which suppress the production of molting hormones (ecdysteroids) from the molting gland or Y-organ (YO). Both MLA and ESA are effective methods for molt induction in Gecarcinus lateralis. However, some G. lateralis individuals are refractory to MLA, as they fail to complete ecdysis by 12weeks post-MLA; these animals are in the ""blocked"" condition. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify mRNA levels of neuropeptide and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling genes in YO, eyestalk ganglia (ESG), thoracic ganglion (TG), and brain of intact and blocked animals. Six of the seven neuropeptide signaling genes, three of four mTOR signaling genes, and Gl-elongation factor 2 (EF2) mRNA levels were significantly higher in the ESG of blocked animals. Gl-MIH and Gl-CHH mRNA levels were higher in the TG and brain of blocked animals and levels increased in both control and blocked animals in response to ESA. By contrast, mRNA levels of Gl-EF2 and five of the 10 MIH signaling pathway genes in the YO were two to four orders of magnitude higher in blocked animals compared to controls. These data suggest that increased MIH and CHH synthesis in the ESG contributes to the prevention of molt induction by MLA in blocked animals. The up-regulation of MIH signaling genes in the YO of blocked animals suggests that the YO is more sensitive to MIH produced in the ESG, as well as MIH produced in brain and TG of ESA animals. Both the up-regulation of MIH signaling genes in the YO and of Gl-MIH and Gl-CHH in the ESG, TG, and brain appear to contribute to some G. lateralis individuals being refractory to MLA and ESA.",Autotomy; Crustacea; Cyclic nucleotide; Ecdysteroid; Molt-inhibiting hormone; Molting; Nitric oxide synthase; Y-organ; cAMP; cGMP; mTOR.,Natalie L Pitts;Hanna M Schulz;Stephanie R Oatman;Donald L Mykles
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9634187/,Transesophageal ultrasonography of the normal canine mediastinum,"The mediastinum of eight normal research dogs was examined by transesophageal ultrasonography with a 5 MHz frequency transducer to establish a baseline for future use of this new imaging modality as a diagnostic tool. Each examination consisted of 360 degree scans in both transverse and sagittal planes from the thoracic inlet to the esophageal hiatus. Dissections of four of these research dogs were then performed to confirm transesophageal ultrasonography findings. Transesophageal ultrasonography of the mediastinum was a good imaging modality for the evaluation of the heartbase, the major cranial mediastinal vessels, the descending aorta, and occasionally part of the azygos vein. Anatomic orientation was best obtained by beginning the examination at the heart base. Lymph nodes and smaller caliber vessels could not be distinguished from surrounding tissues; however, Doppler ultrasound was useful for identifying the smaller vessels. Although a 5 MHz frequency transducer is preferred for transesophageal echocardiography, a higher frequency transducer would improve the resolution of the images of small near-field structures and may be more appropriate for mediastinal imaging.",,R S St-Vincent;J W Pharr
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18399879/,Thoracic splenosis: A diagnosis by history and imaging,"Thoracic splenosis (TS) is autoimplantation of ectopic splenic tissue in the thoracic cavity that occurs following splenic injury. The majority of cases of TS are asymptomatic and are diagnosed in the course of an evaluation of incidentally discovered pulmonary lesions. Some cases may be difficult to diagnose, especially if features suggesting TS are not recognized. This may lead to an extensive work-up and unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures including thoracotomy. This case report describes a 40-year-old man, who was diagnosed incidentally with TS, several years after the initial injury. Multiple, asymptomatic, left-sided pleural based lesions associated with a history of thoracoabdominal injury and splenectomy are the key points that should alert suspicion of TS, which can then simply be confirmed by a Tc-99m sulphur colloid radionuclide scan. Most patients are treated conservatively unless they are symptomatic.

The patients were 9 men and 5 women aged 36 to 63 years (mean, 49.5 years). Clinically, 11 patients presented with nonspecific symptoms including cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, and back pain while 3 patients were asymptomatic. Anatomically, 9 tumors were in an intrapulmonary location, 3 in the mediastinum, and 2 in the trachea. Surgical resection was performed in all cases, and grossly the tumors varied in size from 1.5 to 4.5 cm in greatest diameter. Histologically, 12 cases corresponded to glomus tumor characterized by a homogenous proliferation of medium-sized cells with round nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli and no evidence of mitotic activity or necrosis. In 2 cases, the presence of marked cellular pleomorphism, nuclear atypia, and mitotic activity was more in keeping with a diagnosis of glomangiosarcoma. The 2 glomangiosarcomas were located in the lung, one of which was associated with lymph node metastasis. Immunohistochemical stains for smooth muscle actin were positive in all cases while negative for epithelial, vascular, neuroendocrine, and neural markers. Clinical follow-up showed that all patients with a glomus tumor are alive and well after a period of 12 to 36 months after surgical resection. In contrast, the 2 patients with glomangiosarcoma died of tumor 24 and 36 months, respectively, after initial diagnosis. The current cases highlight the ubiquitous distribution of these tumors within the thoracic cavity and stress the importance of including these tumors in the differential diagnosis of thoracic neoplasms.",Glomangioma; Glomangiosarcoma; Glomus tumor; Lung; Mediastinum; Thorax; Trachea.,Annikka Weissferdt;Neda Kalhor;Cesar A Moran

Small amounts of pleural fluid are severely difficult to identify with imaging methods (chest x-rays and ultrasound). Nevertheless, it may be an important finding, sometimes leading to a definitive diagnosis of pleural carcinomatosis, infection or other pathologic condition. Chest x-rays were used for many years for the diagnosis of small pleural effusions. Lateral decubitus chest radiographs represented a gold standard for imaging of small amounts of plural fluid for more than 80 years. In the last two decades, ultrasonography of pleural space became a leading real-time method for demonstrating small pleural effusions. Furthermore, the advent of sonographic technology actually enables detection of physiologic pleural fluid in some otherwise healthy individuals. In conclusion, new definitions of the key terms in the field of diagnostic imaging of small amounts of pleural fluid seem to be justified. We suggest that the term pleural fluid should determine physiologic pleural space condition while the term pleural effusion should only be used in the cases of pleural involvement or pleural illness.",,Igor Kocijancic

The age, sex, presence of cavitations, single or multiple. thin walled or thick walled, presence of fluid level or fungal ball in the cavity and the lobar distribution of cavitations in the lungs were assessed. There were 83 (71.6%) males and 33 (28.4%) females with mean age of 37.99 +/- 14.11. A total of 58 patients (50%) presented with cavitations and no sex preponderance observed. There were more cases with multiple (38 patients = 32.8%) than single (20 patients = 17.2%) cavitations (P<0.05). Cavitations were more common in the right (28.23%) and left upper lobes and less common in the left lower and lingula (9.68%) lobes (Table 3).

Standardised for body mass (M(B)), static lung compliance was significantly less in tegus without PHS. Pleural and abdominal pressures followed, like ventilation, a biphasic pattern. In general, pressures increased during expiration and decreased during inspiration. However, during expiration pressure changes showed a marked intra- and interindividual variation. The removal of the PHS resulted in a lower cranio-caudal intracoelomic pressure differential, but had no effect on the general pattern of pressure changes accompanying ventilation. These results show that a perforated PHS that lacks striated muscle has significant influence on static breathing mechanics in Tupinambis and by analogy provides valuable insight into similar processes that led to the evolution of the mammalian diaphragm.",,Wilfried Klein;Augusto S Abe;Steven F Perry

The CT scans of five patients presenting with textilomas after being submitted to thoracotomy for myocardial revascularisation were reviewed retrospectively. Two chest radiologists studied the scans independently, and decisions concerning the CT findings were made by consensus. In each of the five cases, the imaging findings were similar and showed lesions resembling an extrapulmonary mass and well-defined contours situated at the marginal posterior pleural surface. In four of the five cases, a low-density centre and peripheral rim-like enhancement were observed after administration of contrast media. The suspicion of textiloma should be raised when a patient with a history of previous myocardial revascularisation surgery presents with an extrapulmonary mass in close contact with the posterior pleural surface.",,L F Nobre;E Marchiori;F May;A D Carrão Jr;G Zanetti;D M Machado

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14959734/,Ventriculopleural shunt: thoracoscopic placement of the distal catheter,"Ventriculopleural shunting is usually reserved for patients with limited options for shunt revisions. We report the case of a 16-year-old boy with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus who required numerous shunt procedures. At the age of 6 years, a ventriculopleural shunt was inserted by an intercostal thoracotomy, and 4 years later replacement of the distal catheter was necessary. Recently, he presented again with a shunt malfunction due to migration of the pleural catheter. We describe a technique for performing the placement of the distal catheter under direct thoracoscopic vision by a peel-off needle into the unscarred thoracic cavity despite two previous pleural procedures. The postoperative course was uneventful. Thoracoscopic assistance in ventriculopleural shunt placement appears to be a safe and effective technique, offering several advantages over the open procedure: it is less invasive, allows a precise positioning of the thoracic catheter under visual control, and confirms appropriate function.",,S Kurschel;H G Eder;J Schleef
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22080485/,Effect of changes in intrathoracic pressure on cardiac function at rest and during moderate exercise in health and heart failure,"This study investigated the effect of changes in inspiratory intrathoracic pressure on stroke volume at rest and during moderate exercise in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFREF) as well as healthy individuals. Stroke volume was obtained by echocardiography during 2 min of spontaneous breathing (S), two progressive levels of inspiratory unloading (UL1 and UL2) using a ventilator, and two progressive levels of inspiratory loading using resistors in 11 patients with HFREF (61 ± 9 years old; ejection fraction 32 ± 4%; NYHA class I-II) and 11 age-matched healthy individuals at rest and during exercise at 60% of maximal aerobic capacity on a semi-recumbent cycle ergometer. At rest, inspiratory unloading progressively decreased stroke volume index (SVI; S, 35.2 ± 5.4 ml m(-2); UL1, 33.3 ± 5.1 ml m(-2); and UL2, 32.2 ± 4.4 ml m(-2)) in healthy individuals, while it increased SVI (S, 31.4 ± 4.6 ml m(-2); UL1, 32.0 ± 5.9 ml m(-2); and UL2, 34.0 ± 7.2 ml m(-2)) in patients with HFREF (P = 0.04). During moderate exercise, inspiratory unloading decreased SVI in a similar manner (S, 43.9 ± 7.1 ml m(-2); UL1, 40.7 ± 4.7 ml m(-2); and UL2, 39.9 ± 3.7 ml m(-1)) in healthy individuals, while it increased SVI (S, 40.8 ± 6.5 ml m(-2); UL1, 42.8 ± 6.9 ml m(-2); and UL2, 44.1 ± 4. ml m(-2)) in patients with HFREF (P = 0.02). Inspiratory loading did not significantly change SVI at rest or during moderate exercise in both groups. It is concluded that inspiratory unloading improved SVI at rest and during moderate exercise in patients with HFREF, possibly due to a reduction in left ventricular afterload.",,Sophie Lalande;Charles E Luoma;Andrew D Miller;Bruce D Johnson

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20226466/,Combination of a model-deformation method and a positional MRI to quantify the effects of posture on the anatomical structures of the trunk,"Understanding the postural effects on organs and skeleton could be crucial for several applications. This paper reports on a methodology to quantify the three-dimensional effects of postures on deformable anatomical structures. A positional MRI scanner was used to image the full trunk in four postures: supine, standing, seated and forward-flexed. The MRI stacks were processed with a custom toolbox, implemented using open source software. The semi-automated segmentation was based on the deformation of generic models of the pelvis, sternum, femoral heads, spine, liver, kidneys, spleen, skin, thoracic and abdominal cavities. The toolbox was designed to be easily extended by additional image filters, deformation schemes, or new generic models. Results obtained on one subject demonstrate that the method can be used to quantify the effects of postures on skeleton and organs. The spinal curvature, the pelvic parameters and the volume of the thoracic cavity were affected by the four postures. The volumes of the kidneys, spleen, liver and abdominal object were mostly unaffected. The movement of organs was coherent with the effect of gravity. The deformation of organs between postures was expressed using geometrical transformations. Investigations should be pursued on a larger population to confirm the patterns observed on the first subject.",,Y Lafon;F W Smith;P Beillas

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22579793/,Use of a molecular approach for the definitive diagnosis of proliferative larval mesocestoidiasis in a cat,"A 9 year-old male, neutered cat with a history of a sudden onset of lethargy, anorexia and respiratory distress was presented in a veterinary practice in Lucca, Italy. A clinical examination revealed that the cat was severely dehydrated, and had pale mucous membranes and tachypnoea. No pain or discomfort was detected at the time of physical examination. The cat was administered fluids, antibiotics and supportive therapy, but died overnight. The owner of the cat requested for a post mortem examination to be conducted. At necropsy, acephalic structures, consistent with proliferative tapeworm (cestode) larvae, were detected in the thoracic cavity on pleural surfaces. As these larvae could not be identified to genus or species by microscopy, a PCR-based sequencing-phylogenetic approach was used. Part of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene was PCR-amplified from genomic DNAs from five individual larvae and sequenced; all five sequences obtained were identical. This consensus sequence was aligned (over 355 nucleotide positions) with homologous sequences representing a range of cestodes (including Echinococcus granulosus, Echinococcus multilocularis, Hymenolepis microstoma, Mesocestoides spp. and Taenia saginata) from previously published studies and then subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The sequence representing the larval cestode from the affected cat grouped, with strong statistical support, with those representing Mesocestoides corti and Mesocestoides lineatus. Therefore, a definitive diagnosis of pleural proliferative larval mesocestoidiasis could be made. This study illustrates the value of using molecular tools to directly assist clinical and pathological investigations of cestodiases of animals.",,Abdul Jabbar;Roberto Papini;Nadia Ferrini;Robin B Gasser

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16628438/,Therapy monitoring using dynamic MRI: analysis of lung motion and intrathoracic tumor mobility before and after radiotherapy,"A frequent side effect after radiotherapy of lung tumors is a decrease of pulmonary function accompanied by dyspnea due to developing lung fibrosis. The aim of this study was to monitor lung motion as a correlate of pulmonary function and intrathoracic tumor mobility before and after radiotherapy (RT) using dynamic MRI (dMRI). Thirty-five patients with stage I non-small-cell lung carcinoma were examined using dMRI (trueFISP; three images/s). Tumors were divided into T1 and T2 tumors of the upper, middle and lower lung region (LR). Maximum craniocaudal (CC) lung dimensions and tumor mobility in three dimensions were monitored. Vital capacity (VC) was measured and correlated using spirometry. Before RT, the maximum CC motion of the tumor-bearing hemithorax was 5.2 +/- 0.9 cm if the tumor was located in the lower LR (middle LR: 5.5 +/- 0.8 cm; upper LR: 6.0 +/- 0.6 cm). After RT, lung motion was significantly reduced in the lower LR (P < 0.05). Before RT, the maximum CC tumor mobility was significantly higher in tumors of the lower LR 2.5 +/- 0.6 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.3 cm (middle LR; P < 0.05) vs. 0.7 +/- 0.2 cm (upper LR; P < 0.01). After RT, tumor mobility was significantly reduced in the lower LR (P < 0.01) and in T2 tumor patients (P < 0.05). VC showed no significant changes. dMRI is capable of monitoring changes in lung motion that were not suspected from spirometry. This might make the treatment of side effects possible at a very early stage. Changes of lung motion and tumor mobility are highly dependent on the tumor localization and tumor diameter.",,Christian Plathow;Holger Hof;Sabine Kuhn;Michael Puderbach;Sebastian Ley;Juergen Biederer;Claus D Claussen;Peter E Huber;Juergen Schaefer;Siegfried Tuengerthal;Hans-Ulrich Kauczor

All patients were hospitalized with chest tube drainage of pleural effusion until the daily drainage volume was less than 100 ml. Twenty-five mg of minocycline, 1 to 3 KE of OK-432, and 5 to 10 mg of cisplatin were instilled into the pleural space. The administration was repeated until drainage effusion disappeared. Therapeutic effect was evaluated according to the following criteria: (1) excellent, no fluid reaccumulation for at least 4 weeks as determined by chest radiogram and clinical evaluation; (2) effective, fluid reaccumulation less than 50% of original effusion with no need of thoracentesis for symptomatic relief within 4 weeks after treatment; and (3) failure, reaccumulation of more than 50% of the original effusion requiring thoracentesis to relieve symptoms within 4 weeks of treatment. Twelve patients with malignant effusion received the combination treatment; 11 patients had primary lung cancer and one had metastatic lung tumor from cancer of the rectum. In all cases, the histology or cytology revealed adenocarcinoma. Eleven of the 12 patients had an excellent response with relief of clinical symptoms. The remaining case failed to show any improvement. Complications such as local pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting were mild and transient.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22716660/,Assessment and prediction of thoracic gas volume in pregnant women: an evaluation in relation to body composition assessment using air displacement plethysmography,"Assessment of body fat (BF) in pregnant women is important when investigating the relationship between maternal nutrition and offspring health. Convenient and accurate body composition methods applicable during pregnancy are therefore needed. Air displacement plethysmography, as applied in Bod Pod, represents such a method since it can assess body volume (BV) which, in combination with body weight, can be used to calculate body density and body composition. However, BV must be corrected for the thoracic gas volume (TGV) of the subject. In non-pregnant women, TGV may be predicted using equations, based on height and age. It is unknown, however, whether these equations are valid during pregnancy. Thus, we measured the TGV of women in gestational week 32 (n 27) by means of plethysmography and predicted their TGV using equations established for non-pregnant women. Body weight and BV of the women was measured using Bod Pod. Predicted TGV was significantly (P = 0·033) higher than measured TGV by 6 % on average. Calculations in hypothetical women showed that this overestimation tended to be more pronounced in women with small TGV than in women with large TGV. The overestimation of TGV resulted in a small but significant (P = 0·043) overestimation of BF, equivalent to only 0·5 % BF, on average. A Bland-Altman analysis showed that the limits of agreement were narrow (from -1·9 to 2·9 % BF). Thus, although predicted TGV was biased and too high, the effect on BF was marginal and probably unimportant in many situations.",,Pontus Henriksson;Marie Löf;Elisabet Forsum

This procedure is associated with a low incidence of complications; however, some of them, such as iatrogenic pneumothorax, can be fatal. Pneumothorax after percutaneous tracheostomy is most often caused by perforation of the tracheal wall or malposition of the cannula. A woman in her 80s was referred to the emergency department owing to persistent and prolonged coughing. Having speculated that she had acute epiglottitis, and having failed to achieve oral tracheal intubation, the physician performed a percutaneous tracheostomy to secure her airway. However, progressive percutaneous emphysema developed immediately thereafter, and the patient died shortly. Postmortem computed tomography showed bilateral pneumothorax. Forensic autopsy revealed that the tracheostomy cannula had failed to reach the trachea and was erroneously inserted into the right thoracic cavity via peritracheal route. Thus, it was determined that the patient's death was attributable to tension pneumothorax caused by cannula malposition during attempted tracheostomy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first forensic autopsy case report on fatal tension pneumothorax caused by attempted percutaneous tracheostomy.",Autopsy; Forensic science; Pneumothorax; Tracheostomy.,Shuheng Wen;Kana Unuma;Ryo Watanabe;Koichi Uemura

Samples diagnosed as reactive mesothelial cells (14 cases) or malignant tumors (28 cases) in cavital fluids were examined. Immunocytochemical staining of MCM 7, topo IIalpha, and Ki-67 was performed with the universal immunoperoxidase polymer method. In reactive mesothelial cells, MCM 7 was stained in a fine granular pattern and its distribution was uniform in the nuclei. Topo IIalpha and Ki-67 were stained in a coarse granular pattern and the distributions were the same as MCM 7. In contrast, in malignant cells, MCM 7 was stained in an irregular and fine granular pattern, and topo IIalpha and Ki-67 were stained in a uniform and coarse granular pattern.

Consequently the present study was undertaken to provide information on the origin, size and topographic relationships of the collateral intercostal artery. Ninety cadaveric adult intercostal spaces were dissected using standard procedures. The collateral intercostal arteries were exposed throughout their full length and measured at the points within the intercostal spaces considered to be the most important for clinical purposes. The posterior intercostal arteries and their collateral branches were observed to decrease in size from posterior to anterior; however, no significant differences were present in their size in the first four intercostal spaces. Based on these findings the usual thoracocentesis or thoracoscopy technique, in which it is recommended that puncture is done as close as possible to the superior margin of the inferior rib, may lead to collateral intercostal artery laceration and considerable bleeding. A subtle, but important, modification to this technique is suggested aimed at achieving safer access to the intercostal space. In the modified technique, the puncture should be made in the middle of the intercostal space, thereby reducing the possibility of laceration of the collateral intercostal artery.",,R Porto Da Rocha;A Vengjer;A Blanco;P Traballi de Carvalho;M Leal Dias Mongon;G J Medeiros Fernandes

Ten subjects performed isometric trunk flexion, extension, and lateral bending exertions while generating 0%, 40% and 80% of their maximal IAP or while co-contracting trunk muscles without consciously raising IAP. An additional three subjects performed a variety of ramp IAP, co-contraction and isometric exertion tasks while holding their breaths and while exhaling. An 18 degree-of-freedom, electromyogram (EMG)-assisted biomechanical model was used to quantify trunk muscle co-contraction with calculations of spine compression force and stability. Spine stability and compression force increased proportionally with increased IAP regardless of whether the subjects intentionally generated IAP or consciously avoided it. This increase was accomplished with significantly greater co-contraction of 12 major trunk muscles. The EMG activation of all muscles was highly correlated with IAP and intra-thoracic pressure (ITP) ( r from 0.59 to 0.95). Activity of the thoracic erector spinae correlated the best with ITP ( r=0.81), which in turn was correlated with IAP ( r=0.91). It was not possible to co-contract trunk muscles without generating IAP and ITP, or conversely to generate IAP without trunk muscle co-contraction and increased ITP.",,Jacek Cholewicki;Paul C Ivancic;Andrea Radebold

All fish were parasitized, and 4,649 parasite individuals were found. Twenty-six parasite species were identified although only 6 species were abundant and prevalent: gnathiid isopods, the copepod Hatschekia hemigymni, the digenean Callohelmis pichelinae, and 3 morphotypes of tetraphyllidean cestode larvae. We analyzed whether the body size and microhabitat of the parasites and size of the host affected understanding of the structure of the parasite community. We related the abundance, biovolume, and density of parasites with the host body size and analyzed the abundances and volumetric densities of some parasite species within microhabitats. Although the 2 most abundant species comprised 75% of all parasite individuals, 4 species, each in similar proportion, comprised 85% of the total biovolume. Although larger host individuals had higher richness, abundance, and biovolume of parasites than smaller individuals, overall parasite volumetric density actually decreased with the host body size. Moreover, parasites exhibited abundances and densities significantly different among microhabitats; some parasite species depended on the area available, whereas others selected a specific microhabitat. Parasite and habitat size exhibited interesting relationships that should be considered more frequently. Considerations of these parameters improve understanding of parasite community structure and how the parasites use their habitats.",,Gabriela Muñoz;Thomas H Cribb

A comprehensive pulmonary function evaluation was performed on a 36-day-old patient with Barnes syndrome who was being mechanically ventilated because of severe pulmonary distress secondary to thoracic dystrophy. The measurements consisted of respiratory volumes including functional residual capacity, ventilatory mechanics including compliance and resistance, and thoracoabdominal synchrony. Chest wall compliance was 64% below normal, and the thoracoabdominal motion was indicative of predominantly abdominal displacement during inspiratory breaths. The lungs were functioning at a low functional residual capacity, resulting in low lung compliance and increased pulmonary resistance. As a result of the evaluation, the patient was recommended for lateral thoracic expansion surgery and the ventilatory management was adjusted to focus on end-distending pressure support.",,Thomas L Miller;Timothy Cox;Thomas Blackson;David Paul;Kerry Weiss;Thomas H Shaffer

Seven patients are presented in whom incidental extracardiac findings were observed during the interpretation of the raw data besides the routine evaluation of myocardial reconstructed SPECT slices. These 7 patients were detected out of 582 consecutive patients (1.2%) who had myocardial perfusion SPECT with Tc-99m MIBI. The findings on the raw data led to additional reconstruction of thoracic SPECT images and eventually detailed examination of the extracardiac area. Two of the patients underwent surgery because of incidental extracardiac findings (thymoma and multinodular goiter) on cardiac scintigraphy. Other causes of increased extracardiac activity were the intestine protruded through the left hemithorax, uptake in the pulmonary arterial wall, and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis due to sarcoidosis. The reasons for decreased Tc-99m MIBI accumulation in the extracardiac area in the 2 other patients were significantly dilated pulmonary arteries and hydatic cyst, which were not defined before to our knowledge. Familiarity with the normal biodistribution and variable uptake patterns in the raw images becomes necessary during the interpretation of myocardial SPECT in order not to miss very unusual incidental extracardiac uptake or information that could lead to alteration in patient management. Potential underlying mechanisms of extracardiac Tc-99m MIBI accumulation are discussed, and the literature about noncardiac Tc-99m MIBI findings detected on myocardial perfusion SPECT studies was reviewed.",,Gonca Kara Gedik;Eser Lay Ergün;Mehmet Aslan;Biray Caner

These included 40 cases of cardiac tamponade, 2 mediastinal hematomas, 1 contused myocardium, 3 esophageal wounds, and 1 VSD. Stab wounds were most common (73%) followed by gunshot wounds (23%), and shotgun wounds (4%). When measured, central venous pressure was 15 cm or greater in 28 out of 32 patients (87.5%) with proven tamponade. By contrast, Beck's criteria (distended neck veins, distant heart sounds, hypotension) were noted in only 19 (48%) of 40 cases of tamponade. Emergency room pericardiocentesis resulted in improvement in 20 of 22 cases (91%), affording time for definitive operative therapy. The majority of entrance wounds (85%) occurred in the anterior mediastinal region. Peritoneal lavage in 15 cases yielded 5 true positive, 9 true negative, and 1 false positive tests. Most commonly injured areas were right ventricle (20 patients), left ventricle (11 patients), pericardium (5 patients), and right atrium (4 patients). Isolated esophageal injuries occurred in 3 of 11 gunshot wounds (27%). Complications were numerous (70%) and mortality ranges as follows: GSW 27% SW 15% SGW 0%. Central venous pressure determination and early pericardiocentesis are useful in suspected cases of tamponade. In GSW, an esophagogram is indicated to rule out isolated injury.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15757064/,TFC (thoracic fluid content): a new parameter for assessment of changes in chest fluid volume,"Clinical assessment of cardiac status can be difficult and incomplete without an assessment of fluid volume status, especially of the lungs. Now, a new parameter is available, thoracic fluid content (TFC). It is an indicator of total fluid volume, both intracellular and extracellular. Because it is measured noninvasively using impedance cardiography (ICG), it could be a welcome addition to the physician's assessment. An evaluation of TFC was performed beginning with 1) an examination of chest impedance (Z) as an accurate means of following fluid changes, 2) the relationship of TFC to Z using both loop and spot electrodes, and 3) clinical applications of TFC. In 1) 12 dogs, Z was superior (r = 0.935, P < 0.006) to 10 traditional hemodynamic and gas transfer parameters in trending a lactated Ringer's infusion; 2) a plastic model, changes in TFC values derived from Z measurements using both loop and spot electrodes were virtually identical and paralleled infused saline (r = 0.999, P < 0.001); 3) the clinical setting, TFC trended fluid changes well. From these results, we conclude that TFC is a reliable measurement of chest fluid status and of changes in that fluid. Along with cardiac index (CI), also provided by the ICG monitor, TFC can be very helpful to the clinician.",,Joseph M van de Water;Bruce E Mount;K M Dinesh Chandra;B Parrish Mitchell;Tajalyn A Woodruff;Martin L Dalton

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22808110/,Anticoagulant rodenticides on our public and community lands: spatial distribution of exposure and poisoning of a rare forest carnivore,"Anticoagulant rodenticide (AR) poisoning has emerged as a significant concern for conservation and management of non-target wildlife. The purpose for these toxicants is to suppress pest populations in agricultural or urban settings. The potential of direct and indirect exposures and illicit use of ARs on public and community forest lands have recently raised concern for fishers (Martes pennanti), a candidate for listing under the federal Endangered Species Act in the Pacific states. In an investigation of threats to fisher population persistence in the two isolated California populations, we investigate the magnitude of this previously undocumented threat to fishers, we tested 58 carcasses for the presence and quantification of ARs, conducted spatial analysis of exposed fishers in an effort to identify potential point sources of AR, and identified fishers that died directly due to AR poisoning. We found 46 of 58 (79%) fishers exposed to an AR with 96% of those individuals having been exposed to one or more second-generation AR compounds. No spatial clustering of AR exposure was detected and the spatial distribution of exposure suggests that AR contamination is widespread within the fisher's range in California, which encompasses mostly public forest and park lands Additionally, we diagnosed four fisher deaths, including a lactating female, that were directly attributed to AR toxicosis and documented the first neonatal or milk transfer of an AR to an altricial fisher kit. These ARs, which some are acutely toxic, pose both a direct mortality or fitness risk to fishers, and a significant indirect risk to these isolated populations. Future research should be directed towards investigating risks to prey populations fishers are dependent on, exposure in other rare forest carnivores, and potential AR point sources such as illegal marijuana cultivation in the range of fishers on California public lands.",,Mourad W Gabriel;Leslie W Woods;Robert Poppenga;Rick A Sweitzer;Craig Thompson;Sean M Matthews;J Mark Higley;Stefan M Keller;Kathryn Purcell;Reginald H Barrett;Greta M Wengert;Benjamin N Sacks;Deana L Clifford

The thoracic particulate matter geometric mean of 0.32 m/m (3)was below the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.4 mg/m (3). The total particulate matter geometric mean of 0.52 mg/m (3), however, was above 0.5 mg/m (3), the total particulate matter concentration offered as a surrogate REL in the NIOSHCriteria for a Recommended Standard for Occupational Exposure to Metalworking Fluids.[1]Of the 83 total particulate matter results that were at or above smash 0.5 mg/m (3), only 50 (60%) of the corresponding thoracic particulate matter results were at or above 0.4 mg/m (3). These data indicated a conversion factor of 1.65 between thoracic particulate matter and total particulate matter concentrations and 1.40 between thoracic extractable particulate matter and total extractable concentrations. These factors were significantly different from the 1.25 used to compare total particulate matter with thoracic particulate matter concentrations in the NIOSHCriteria Document[1](p < 0.01) and call into question the validity of a universal conversion factor. The authors conclude that thoracic particulate matter exposure assessment should be done directly. In terms of protecting the worker, however, the 1.25 conversion factor appeared to be conservative since each time a total particulate matter result was below 0.5 mg/m (3), its paired thoracic particulate matter measurement was below 0.4 mg/m (3).",,Beth Donovan Reh;Joshua M Harney;Robert E McCleery;Charles A Mueller

Group 1 (60 patients) had abnormalities on initial screening, while group 2 (10 patients) had no symptom of thoracic or mediastinal injury. TEE was performed within 48 hours following admission and its results were compared with those of the initial screening. TEE usefulness was evaluated on a score grade from 0 (no interest) to 4 (outstanding interest). Myocardial contusion was suspected in 25 patients. TEE invalidated 18 suspected and found 5 unsuspected myocardial contusions. Pericardial effusion was suspected in only one case, while TEE documented 13 additional cases. A mediastinal enlargement was seen in 13 patients, but TEE invalidated aortic lesions in all these cases and made an unsuspected diagnosis of aortic tears. Eight cases of severe hypovolemia and seven cases of left ventricle dysfunction were detected by TEE.

In the early period, only an ordinary right thoracic drain was put in place, and when leakage occurred, two patients died because of pyothorax, while one patient was saved by surgical drainage. However, in the recent period, in addition to the ordinary right thoracic drain, another drain has also been placed just distal to the anastomosis through the esophageal hiatus through the abdominal cavity, exiting the abdominal wall. After such procedure, drainage has been adequate without any occurrence of pyothorax, even when anastomotic leakage occurred, as in the two most recent instances. Therefore, unless drainage is inadequate and surgical drainage is indicated, as in instances of necrosis of substitutes, mediastinoabdominal drainage seems to be effective in the treatment of intrathoracic anastomotic leakage.",,H Kuwano;T Matsushima;M Ikebe;K Baba;K Kitamura;Y Toh;Y Adachi;K Sugimachi
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2345903/,Anatomical review of the lymph nodes of the human mediastinum,"The anatomy of the lymph nodes of the human mediastinum was studied in 984 cases over a period of 17 years. Some findings in past publications were confirmed, but new data on nomenclature and location were obtained. Further, it has been possible to describe more clearly some groups and chains that are poorly defined in the classic literature, in the Nomina Anatomica and by more recent authors. Lymph gland groups have been found which have not apparently been previously described, so that the author proposes a new topographic division of the mediastinum which allows a more accurate localisation within the thoracic cavity. Twelve paired lymph node centres are defined (11 symmetric, one asymetric) and one single centre.",,I Caplan
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3983392/,Differentiation of volume averaging and mass on magnetic resonance images of the mediastinum,"Volume averaging of high intensity mediastinal fat and low intensity flowing blood in mediastinal vessels can mimic a mediastinal mass on magnetic resonance (MR) images of the chest. However, when different repetition times (TR) are used to perform two imaging sequences, volume averaging can be distinguished from true disease, since the ratio of intensities of mediastinal fat, which is volume averaged, to nonvolume-averaged fat will remain relatively constant on a pair of images obtained using different TR times. Mediastinal masses, on the other hand, will exhibit predictable alterations in intensity relative to fat with changing TR.",,W R Webb;E H Moore

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7074652/,Influence of mediastinal adenopathy on site and frequency of relapse in patients with Hodgkin's disease,"Between April 1969 and July 1979, 267 patients with surgically staged IA-IIB Hodgkin's disease and 31 with clinically staged IIE or IV Hodgkin's disease were treated; disease was limited to the area above the diaphragm. Three separate groups of patients with mediastinal adenopathy were identified. Patients with disease limited to the mediastinum had a favorable prognosis, and treatment with mantle followed by para-aortic irradiation has resulted in 85% relapse-free survival and 100% overall survival at 8 years. Surgically staged patients with large diameter mediastinal adenopathy (greater than 0.33 of the thoracic diameter) have a high relapse rate with radiation therapy alone. The use of combined modality therapy has reduced the risk of relapse in these patients, but the survival remains higher whether MOPP is used initially or at relapse. Clinically staged IIE patients or stage IV patients with extensive extranodal disease limited to the thoracic cavity were treated with chemotherapy and involved- or extended-field irradiation. These patients had a 5-year survival of 66% with large mediastinal adenopathy and 90% with lesser mediastinal disease.",,P Mauch;D Gorshein;J Cunningham;S Hellman
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10330265/,Contamination of lymph from the major prenodal cardiac lymphatic in dogs,"Cannulation of the canine major prenodal cardiac lymphatic (MPCL) is the most common approach for the investigation of myocardial lymphatic function. However, the assumption that the MPCL drains pure cardiac lymph has been questioned. We studied variations of MPCL anatomy and investigated whether noncardiac lymph is drained by this lymphatic. After dye was injected into the lungs and left ventricular myocardium in 21 dogs, dissection of the cardiac lymphatic system yielded 3 anatomic variations. In variations 1 and 2 (81% of dogs), a mixture of cardiac and pulmonary lymph was drained via the MPCL. In variation 3 (19% of dogs) no connection was found between MPCL and pulmonary lymphatics. In variations 1 and 2, alteration of tidal volume resulted in significant changes of lymph flow rate. The pulmonary contribution to MPCL lymph flow was estimated as 34% in variation 2. We conclude that MPCL lymph may contain not only cardiac lymph but also significant pulmonary contamination. This finding should be considered in the interpretation of lymph data from cannulation of the canine MPCL.",,H J Geissler;K L Davis;G A Laine;M L Brennan;U Mehlhorn;S J Allen
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32578933/,Lung ultrasound in a respiratory pandemic,"Australian hospitals have prepared for a major surge in patients due to the infectious respiratory pandemic COVID-19. In other nations, patient presentations have overwhelmed resources. Ultrasound has been shown to be an effective tool to exclude significant life-threats in resource poor settings. In this article, we will describe three lung ultrasound algorithms for the emergency diagnosis of patients presenting with respiratory symptoms during a COVID-19 pandemic: (i) LUSC19: lung ultrasound to assess the severity of COVID-19; (ii) LUSAC: lung ultrasound to exclude alternative causes of respiratory distress; and (iii) LUSI: lung ultrasound following intubation. We anticipate that emergency physicians will use these algorithms during the upcoming respiratory pandemic to rapidly determine the severity of COVID-19 infection, to seek and treat significant alternative diagnoses and ensure endotracheal intubation.",COVID-19; disaster; emergency; lung; ultrasound.,Amaali Lokuge;Jana Alexander;Benjamin Land;Amy McAllister
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12719018/,"Prevalence of and carcass condemnation from maedi-visna, paratuberculosis and caseous lymphadenitis in culled sheep from Quebec, Canada","We determined the prevalence of lung and mammary gland lesions associated with maedi-visna (MV) infection, the prevalence of paratuberculosis (PTB), and the prevalence and lesions distribution of caseous lymphadenitis (CL) in culled sheep. Total of 451 ewes and 34 rams were selected randomly from two slaughterhouses in Quebec, Canada. MV serostatus was determined by recombinant ELISA test. PTB diagnosis was based on characteristic histological lesions in the terminal ileum, ileocecal lymph node and/or ileocecal valve and CL by gross detection of abscesses and isolation of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. Seroprevalence of MV was 44% (95% CI: 40, 48). Seropositivity increased with age and was higher in ewes than in rams. The percentages of lung and mammary gland lesions in seropositive sheep were 14 and 40%, respectively, but mammary gland lesions lack specificity. The prevalence of PTB was 3% (95% CI: 2, 5). PTB increased with age and was lower among sheep with abscesses. The prevalence of CL was >/=21% (95% CI: 17, 24). The most-prevalent site of caseous lymphadenitis lesions was the thoracic cavity. The risk of carcass condemnation was significantly associated with region, body score and abscesses. Only the presence of abscesses was associated with an increase in trimming of carcasses.",,Julie Arsenault;Christiane Girard;Pascal Dubreuil;Danielle Daignault;Jean René Galarneau;Julie Boisclair;Carole Simard;Denise Bélanger

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20058143/,Retained foreign body following pleural drainage with a small-bore catheter,"Small-bore radiopaque drains can be used to drain pleural effusions. They offer reliable drainage of simple pleural effusions and provide a safe, less-invasive, more comfortable alternative to the standard tube thoracostomy. Importantly, removal of such drains does not require purse-string sutures and hence can be removed without assistance. We report here the cautionary tale of a retained foreign body related to drainage of a pleural effusion with a Pleurocath in a patient following cardiac surgery to raise awareness of this potential complication. Emphasized is the need for all staff to be familiar with the normal appearance of equipment being utilized in the ward and to report when incomplete removal of drain equipment is suspected. In addition, amendments to insertion techniques for such small-bore drains are proposed to avoid similar undue complications.",,Alenka Paddle;Maqsood Elahi;Andrew Newcomb
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15044678/,Pleural mechanics and fluid exchange,"The pleural space separating the lung and chest wall of mammals contains a small amount of liquid that lubricates the pleural surfaces during breathing. Recent studies have pointed to a conceptual understanding of the pleural space that is different from the one advocated some 30 years ago in this journal. The fundamental concept is that pleural surface pressure, the result of the opposing recoils of the lung and chest wall, is the major determinant of the pressure in the pleural liquid. Pleural liquid is not in hydrostatic equilibrium because the vertical gradient in pleural liquid pressure, determined by the vertical gradient in pleural surface pressure, does not equal the hydrostatic gradient. As a result, a viscous flow of pleural liquid occurs in the pleural space. Ventilatory and cardiogenic motions serve to redistribute pleural liquid and minimize contact between the pleural surfaces. Pleural liquid is a microvascular filtrate from parietal pleural capillaries in the chest wall. Homeostasis in pleural liquid volume is achieved by an adjustment of the pleural liquid thickness to the filtration rate that is matched by an outflow via lymphatic stomata.",,Stephen J Lai-Fook
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6842431/,[Correlation between standard radiology and computed tomography in the demonstration of mediastinal lines],"The mediastinal lines correspond to the contours of the middle and upper mediastinum, and represent the edges of a dense, pleural covered structure marginated by the air within the lung. The mediastinal lines derive their names from the adjacent organs: 1) The posterior mediastinal junction line (where both lungs meet posteriorly, just before the vertebral column). 2) The anterior mediastinal junction line (where both lungs meet anteriorly, behind the sternum). 3) The right paratracheal stripe (where the right lung meets the trachea). 4) The esophageal-pleural stripe (which disappears at the level of the arch of the Azygos vein that divides the right lung from the esophagus. 5) The Azygos-pleural line (where the arch of the Azygos vein meets the right lung). 6) The esophageal-pleural line (where the right esophageal wall meets the right lung). 7) The para-aortic line (that is the most constant). 8) and 9) The left and right paraspinous lines (whereof the right is the most often visible). The absence of one of the mediastinal lines is sometimes insignificant, since it can be caused by anatomical variations or by the conditions of the picture. C.T. explains the formation's mechanism of these mediastinal lines, explains the anatomic reasons for their possible absence or displacement and often provides us with their etiology. C.T. offers a simple, reliable and atraumatic method in cases of displaced or vanished mediastinal lines, and should replace standard tomography of the mediastinum.",,L Divano;M Osteaux;P Peetrons;L Jeanmart
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28622424/,Migration of the distal catheter of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt in hydrocephalus: A Comprehensive Analytical Review from an Anatomical Perspective,"There have been many reports on migration of the distal catheter of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) since this phenomenon was recognized 50 years ago. However, there have been no attempts to analyze its different patterns or to assess these patterns in terms of potential risk to patients. We comprehensively reviewed all reports of distal VPS catheter migration indexed in PubMed and identified three different anatomical patterns of migration based on catheter extension and organs involved: (1) internal, when the catheter invades any viscus inside the thoracic, abdominal, or pelvic cavity; (2) external, when the catheter penetrates through the body wall either incompletely (subcutaneously) or completely (outside the body); and (3) compound, when the catheter penetrates a hollow viscus and protrudes through a pre-existing anatomical orifice. We also analyzed the association between each migration type and several key factors. External migration occurred mostly in infants. In contrast, internal migration occurred mostly in adults. A body wall weakness was not a risk factor for catheter protrusion. Shunt duration was a critical factor in the migration pattern, as most newly-replaced shunts tended to migrate externally. Clinicians must pay close attention to cases of large bowel perforation, since they were most often associated with intracranial infections. The organ involved in compound migration could determine the route of extrusion, as the bowel was involved in all trans-anal migrations and the stomach in most trans-oral cases. Clin.
